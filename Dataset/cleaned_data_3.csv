"a 55 year old boy visited the endocrinological section of the pediatric unit of the general hospital of terni italy due to short stature his mothers height was 170 cm and his fathers height was 172 cm target height 1775 cm  50° centile in his family history there was paternal familiarity for psychotic crises in his adolescence and mother with thrombophilia and history of five pregnancies with three spontaneous abortions and two parts the mother took cardioaspirine during the pregnancy no genetic disease was reported in his family the child was born at term via spontaneous vaginal delivery the birth weight was 3050 gr 10° 25° centile and the birth length was 45 cm below the third centile a villocentesis performed at week 12 of gestation due to an alteration in nuchal translucency on obstetric ultrasound did not reveal any abnormality 46 xy after birth a small ventricular septal defect and mild bilateral pyelectasis were detected but within 6 months both of these abnormalities spontaneously disappeared bilateral orchiopexy was performed at 19 months of age for undescended testicles regarding linear growth auxological data recorded by the primary care pediatrician revealed short stature that was 2 standard deviation sd below the 3° centile on the italian cross sectional growth charts for height  since the first months of life in the last 2 years the child has exhibited an even more exacerbated decline in his growth curve before entering the hospital first level laboratory tests for the evaluation of short stature ie full blood count inflammatory markers renal function hepatic function coeliac screening and thyroid function tests had been already performed no abnormal results were evidenced the bone age was delayed by 2 years
in the hospital his height was 992 cm 3 sd his weight was 155 kg 3° centile and his growth velocity was 4 cmyear 3° centile his arm span was of 94 cm and his sitting height was of 55 cm height ratio was 95 his sitting height height ratio was therefore 56 slightly over the upper normal limit of 555 and his body mass index was below the 50th centile pathological rappold index 8 furthermore he presented with unusual facial features that included hypertelorism low set ears a low posterior hairline down slanting palpebral fissures pectus excavatum and ogival palate figure 
however madelung deformity was not suggested by clinical examination and not detected by wrist x ray findings radiological and laboratory tests to rule out related renal cardiac ophthalmologic and audiological abnormalities did not find any significant alterations at an evaluation conducted by an infant neuropsychiatrist the patient exhibited a mild cognitive impairment compared with the standard for his age that included a prevalent verbal difficulty compatible with the diagnosis of ns eeg and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging results were normal the peak growth hormone gh value in a clonidine stimulation test was in the normal range 127 mgl the igf 1 level was 47 ngml normal values for age 32–259 ngml
although short stature was disproportionate diagnosis of ns was suspected and genetic tests of the ptpn11 gene were requested the entire coding regions and intron exon boundaries of the ptpn11 gene were amplificated by polymerase chain reaction using genomic dna and sequence specific primers both forward and reverse strands were directly sequenced using an automatic dna sequencer the results confirmed ns because a c922ag rs28933386 heterozygous mutation in exon 8 of the ptpn11 gene leading to a pasn308asp substitution was identified reference transcript ncbi nm0028343 and np0028253 this mutation has already been described as pathogenic by siegfried et al 
due to the presence of a mesomelic short stature the concurrent presence of two genetic mutations was considered and a genetic evaluation of the shox gene was requested a test of chromosomal microarray analysis performed with the cgh array led to the identification of a micro duplication at the level of the region par 1 xp2233yp1132 extended about 680 kb involving the shox gene the microduplication in the pseudoautosomal region par1 has already been described in ns and its clinical significance therefore appears to be certain

"a 70 year old gentleman presented with a painless swelling in the right thigh for 7 months which was spontaneous he had a history of femur shaft fracture for which open femur nailing was done 10 years ago postoperatively he had uneventful wound healing and fracture union he has no recollection of any complications following the surgery and was able to walk full weight bearing without any aid clinically he had a large diffuse swelling on the anterolateral aspect of the right thigh which was around 10 cm × 8 cm the swelling was firm non tender and non pulsatile with ill defined margins the presence of a longitudinal scar along the entire length of the lateral aspect of the thigh was noted which had healed by primary intention  the right hip and knee movements were normal routine hematological tests were done including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and c reactive protein all the blood reports were normal
x rays of the femur were done in anteroposterior and lateral views  which showed an irregular hypertrophic cortical reaction with the bony remodeling in the proximal femur and an excavated lateral femoral cortex with a broken intramedullary nail in situ
magnetic resonance imaging mri of the right thigh was done which showed a large well defined and heterogenous soft tissue mass on the anterolateral aspect t1 and t2 images post contrast images showed a heterogeneous and patchy uptake  these findings were consistent with a soft tissue tumor we however did not perform a computed tomography ct scan for this patient
after the mri we decided to do a closed needle biopsy along the previous surgical scar under local anesthesia in the operating theatre the biopsy report was inconclusive demonstrating fibrinous blood material and granulation tissue suggestive of a chronic hematoma
as the patient was symptomatic we decided to plan a surgical excision of the lesion under epidural anesthesia in the supine position the skin incision was taken along the previous scar on the lateral aspect of the thigh granulation tissue and fibrosed muscles overlying the mass were carefully separated we noticed a mass adherent to the lateral aspect of the femur extending intramedullary up to the implant using a cautery we separated the mass from the bone extending up to the intramedullary nail the excised specimen measured 24 cm in length and 15 cm in breadth an intraoperative frozen section analysis was done that revealed a chronic inflammatory reaction and no evidence of sarcoma the defect after excision of the mass was filled with frozen allograft the excised specimen was solid with a fibrotic wall on gross examination after dissecting the specimen a mop was found  and 
the sample was sent for histological study which revealed fibrous strands clots hemolyzed pigments of red blood cells inflammatory cells and multiple fiber strands the foreign material was studied under polarized light  and confirmed the diagnosis of gossypiboma by demonstrating cotton fibers the specimen was reported as an accumulation of blood products and their degraded components and not a tumor

"a 78 year old woman was referred to our clinic with bilateral hearing loss with sound distortion tinnitus and auditory hypersensitivity recurrent vertigodizziness induced by loud noises tullio phenomenon and a diagnosis of bilateral sscd at the temporal bone hrct performed in the emergency room figures 2a–c
preoperative audiometry indicated severe mixed hearing loss in the right ear with moderate conductive hearing impairment in the left ear  a pure tone sound of 110 db at 500 and 1000 hz in the right ear and pneumatically increasing external auditory canal pressure induced dizziness without detectable nystagmus on video oculographic or frenzel goggles examination her tympanogram was bilaterally normal a stapedial reflex could not be performed due to patient intolerance dizziness mastoid vibration elicited dizziness without detectable nystagmus on video oculographic or frenzel goggles examination a temporal bone 15 t mri with 3d reconstruction performed two months before did not show the bilateral dehiscence  air conduction cervical vemps cvemps demonstrated a threshold of 85 db hl on the right side and 100 db hl on the left side the cvemps were recorded from both ears using 500 hz short tone bursts stbs a video head impulse test for horizontal and vertical canals including both dehiscent ssc showed normal vestibulo ocular reflex gain bilaterally 
possible surgical procedures superior canal plugging or resurfacing either through a middle fossa approach or via a transmastoid route or rw niche plugging were discussed with the patient comorbid cardiopulmonary conditions represented major contraindications for general anesthesia so the latter procedure was the only possible option to pursue
since the patient did not show bilaterally any benefit from an air conduction hearing aid but rather had deteriorating auditory and vestibular symptoms on the right we decided to perform the surgical procedure in the right ear as it had worse vestibular and auditory symptoms a poorer hearing threshold and greatly altered hrct and vemps findings
with local assisted anesthesia we performed a transcanal approach with elevation of the tympanomeatal flap and preservation of the chorda tympani nerve with a minimally invasive retroauricular incision ossicular mobility and continuity were assessed we excluded the stapedial fixation and no cerebrospinal fluid csf leak was observed during the surgical procedure after identification and reshaping of the rw niche a vibroplasty was performed paying particular attention to correctly plugging the round window and coupling it with the floating mass transducer fmt of the vsb  we opted to couple the fmt with the rw because concomitant rw plugging was performed and from previous studies it seemed to provide a more stable coupling over time than incus  no ossicular chain abnormalities or perilymphatic fistula were observed intraoperatively
the plugging of the round window was achieved using cartilage and perichondrium tragus this autologous tissue also helped to seal off the fmt in the round window niche furthermore vsb hearing outcomes were monitored with electrocochleography using a cotton wick recording electrode placed on the hypotympanum

"a 40 year old woman originally from ecuador was referred to our institution for evaluation of progressive dyspnea on exertion two months prior to her presentation she was treated at an outside hospital for presumed community acquired pneumonia with symptoms of dyspnea on exertion fevers chills and productive cough after not seeing measurable improvement the patient then presented to the emergency department at another institution where a transthoracic echocardiogram tte revealed that the patient had a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology and a normal left ventricular ejection fraction lvef of 60 pericardiocentesis was performed with 700 cc of fluid removed which grew mycobacterium tuberculosis tb the patients purified protein derivative ppd skin test was positive the patient was started on anti tb therapy and discharged
she continued to complain of persistent dyspnea on exertion and thus was referred to our institution for a repeat of tte at the outpatient cardiac diagnostic center tte revealed the rare presystolic flow through pulmonic valve excessive variation in the mitral valve and aortic valve spectral doppler velocities and markedly thickened pericardium figures – consistent with constriction  the study also demonstrated septal bounce small pericardial effusion and pleural effusion the patient was admitted for further evaluation on admission the patients vital signs showed a temperature of 37 degrees celsius a blood pressure of 10870 a heart rate of 117 and respiratory rate of 20 with an oxygen saturation of 99 in room air her exam revealed a young woman in mild distress with 11 cm internal jugular vein distension decreased breath sounds at lung bases bilaterally and scant bibasilar crackles regular tachycardia and bilateral lower extremity edema her bnp was 124 crp was 51 and wbc count was 59 with a normal differential her complete metabolic panel was unremarkable the patient underwent a left and right heart catheterization due to the suspicion of constrictive pericarditis a coronary angiogram demonstrated no obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease the right heart catheterization revealed elevated right atrial pressure right ventricular end diastolic pressure and an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure simultaneous right and left ventricular pressure tracings demonstrated discordant respiratory variation consistent with constrictive pericarditis a computed tomography ct scan of her chest with contrast confirmed marked thickening of both the parietal and pleural pericardial surfaces measuring up to 134 mm in thickness and a large right sided pleural effusion figures and  cardiac magnetic resonance imaging mri with and without contrast showed diffuse pericardial thickening  which showed intense delayed gadolinium contrast enhancement  that did not involve the myocardium additionally there was a greater interventricular septal bounce during diastole and inspiration consistent with chronic inflammatory constrictive pericarditis
due to her worsening symptoms and diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis she was referred to cardiothoracic surgery at our institution for pericardiectomy the surgery was without incident and the surgical samples were sent for pathology while being negative for afb by concentrated smear and culture the stripped pericardium showed noncaseating granulomas extensive fibrosis and severe lymphohistiocytic infiltrate
in the immediate postoperative period the patient began to develop signs and symptoms of central volume overload heart failure and hypotension an electrocardiogram ecg at this time showed sinus tachycardia with nonspecific st t abnormalities with poor r wave progression new from prior ecgs a subsequent tte on postoperative day one showed significant changes from the prior study with severely decreased biventricular dysfunction the lvef was severely depressed at 26 with early evidence of elevated filling pressure within the left ventricle indicated by the time difference between pulmonary vein ar duration and mitral a wave duration ar a of positive 46 ms for the right ventricle fractional area change fac was abnormally low at 29 with reduced tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion tapse distance of 096 cm there was also moderate tricuspid regurgitation enlarged right atrium area 27 cm2 and moderately elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 41 mmhg there was akinesis of the entire apical and midventricular segments of both the right and left ventricles figures – with hypercontractile base findings were consistent with stress cardiomyopathy
while in critical condition postoperatively the patient had episodes of atrial fibrillation and atrial tachycardia for which she was chemically cardioverted with intravenous amiodarone with subsequent conversion to sinus rhythm initially the patient required multiple vasopressors and inotropes epinephrine norepinephrine milrinone and dopamine drip to maintain her blood pressure and cardiac output while gentle diuresis was achieved carefully for the symptoms of heart failure once the patient was hemodynamically stable she was placed on appropriate oral medical therapy including carvedilol and furosemide followed by gradual clinical improvement and was able to be discharged on postoperative day 10 due to decreased urine output and hypotension an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker was not initiated at the time a posthospital tte 7 weeks after discharge showed normalized function of both the right and left ventricles figures –",inclusion criteria patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus patients 18 years of age or older patients admitted under medical or surgical services patients treated with diet alone insulin sq insulin pump or oral hypoglycemic medications have their own continuous glucose monitoring cgm monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission exclusion criteria individuals under 18 years of age covid 19 infection infection of the skin at the cgm site requiring removal of the sensor patients with altered mental status patients unable to scan their flash cgms at least every 8 hours inability to provide written consent hospitalized for less than 24 hours,1
"a 59 year old female patient presented to her local family doctor with chronic generalized intermittent colicky abdominal pain and altered bowel habit for a few months she has no other associated symptoms she previously had laparoscopic adjustable gastric band lagb insertion 8 years prior with good result bmi pre procedure was 56 kgm2 and now 36 kgm2 her other comorbidities include hypertension and colonic diverticular disease with previous acute diverticulitis she was organized to have an elective colonoscopy colonoscopy revealed tubular foreign body embedded in the wall of colon with an entry and exit point 55 cm from anal verge fig  there was also significant sigmoid and descending colon diverticular disease
ct abdomen with oral and intravenous contrast was organized to further investigate the tubular foreign body it revealed concurrent gastric band erosion into gastric lumen and connection tubing eroding into the posterior wall of transverse colon and exiting inferiorly figs – there was no evidence of any oral contrast leak from the stomach
this patient has previously been admitted for acute diverticulitis 4 years prior reviewing prior imaging did not reveal any gastric or colonic erosion the gastric band tubing is noted to be running along the inflamed colon since the initial admission for acute diverticulitis she has had multiple further acute diverticulitis episodes which were treated with oral antibiotics we suspect recurrent diverticulitis lead to the erosion of the gastric band into the colon and stomach
as part of the surgical management both colorectal and upper gi surgeon were involved in the operation patient underwent laparoscopic removal of gastric band and laparoscopic assisted wedge resection of transverse colon the gastric band was removed following adhesiolysis and the gastric defect was repaired with intracorporeal suturing the gastric band port was subsequently removed gastroscopy was done to ensure the repair was airtight for the colectomy transverse colon and splenic flexure was mobilized laparoscopically and the transverse colon was extracted through the gastric band port site for external inspection a tract was identified passing from the antimesenteric border to colonic lumen and then along the colonic mesentery a wedge resection performed with stapler end to side anastomosis flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed to confirm the anastomosis was airtight her post operative recovery was uneventful and she continued to be well on post operative follow up in clinic she remains well on subsequent phone follow up 12 months post operatively",inclusion criteria patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 age 65 years or older to be under follow up in the same center for at least one year exclusion criteria younger than 65 years old having decompensated liver disease psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy,1
"a 35 year old right handed man who worked in a bank was admitted to hospital with complaints of neck pain and left sided weakness the patient had developed a sharp pain in the left side posterior aspect of his neck and occiput after a 4 hour flight 4 weeks before presentation at the time he felt nauseated but did not vomit and he was treated conservatively with ultrasound and massage the weakness began acutely after he had turned his head to one side and rapidly progressed from his left leg to his left arm he was immediately unable to walk and subsequently began to experience tingling sensations in his right arm and leg
there was no history of head trauma or neck manipulation no past medical or surgical history and no previous use of medications or previous infectious symptoms the patient was a non smoker did not have diabetes and was normotensive there was no family history of thrombophilia or venous throboembolism both his father and uncle had suffered from ischemic strokes in their late forties he was born in the philippines and had lived in canada since early childhood

"a 30 year old woman from saudi arabia was admitted to our department of internal medicine with the strong suspicion of first manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia laboratory testing showed mild anemia and thrombocytopenia with normal leukocyte count the differential blood cell count however showed 47 leukemic blasts a bone marrow biopsy was performed immediately with approximately 90 blasts the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia aml was confirmed flow cytometry showed an expression of cd34 hla dr cd38 and cympo a cross lineage of cd56 was found which correlates with a poor prognosis  cytogenetics and molecular analysis of the bone marrow cells revealed an etv6 gen deletion in 12p13 according to the hematologic protocol intensive induction chemotherapy with ham high dose ara c and mitoxantron was immediately initiated
on day 8 after admission 2 days after the first cycle of chemotherapy was finished the patient developed neutropenic fever up to a temperature of 394°c the first laboratory testing showed a decrease in leukocytes down to 04 gl with a c reactive protein crp less than 01 mgdl escherichia coli with an extended spectrum beta lactamase esbl was isolated from initially taken blood cultures whereas all other clinical and diagnostic examinations x ray of the chest urine echocardiography and ultrasonography were normal empirical broad spectrum antibiotics was immediately initiated with piperacillintazobactam and switched to meropenem after microbiologic testing confirmed esbl sepsis on that first day of fever the patient told us that she fell in the bathroom hurting her right knee two days before day 6 after admission there was no apparent injury on her leg on further clinical examination besides fever her vital signs were always normal in the course of the next 2 days neutrophils dropped below 01 gl and crp levels soared to a peak of 299 mgdl highest procalcitonin level pct measured was 17 ngml three days after the patient suffered from the minor injury to her lateral thigh she suddenly presented a small hematoma with only little pain day 9 after admission there were no signs of superinfection of the hematoma explaining the clinical and laboratory signs of this unclear systemic infection on that day the patient was first presented to the surgical department within the next two days the hematoma rapidly changed to a big untypical necrosis of the skin day 11 after admission see figure  therefore the patient was again presented to the surgical department the patient was still in a good general condition with only little pain a ct scan was initiated and showed entrapped air under the site of necrosis although the skin manifestation was not typical for a necrotizing soft tissue lesion we considered the possibility of an untypical case of nf during severe neutropenia therefore a surgical exploration was performed immediately see figure  macroscopically subcutaneous tissue fascia and muscle showed the typical characteristics of necrotizing fasciitis with grey necrotic tissue facial edema vessel thrombosis and non contacting muscle intraoperative there was only minimal resistance dissecting the subcutaneous fascia off the deep fascia which is commonly described as positive “finger test”  the histological findings showed facial necrosis vasculitis thrombosis and suppuration of the veins and arteries coursing through the fascia but there were no signs of disease causing bacteria or infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the deep dermis and fascia as expected first microbiological testing did not find any bacteria the initial histopathological report could not confirm the typical picture of necrotizing fasciitis see figure  in the further course of time intensive care medicine was needed after confirmation of adequate morphologic blast clearance in the bone marrow supportive treatment with granulocyte colony stimulating factor g csf was added on day 18 after start of chemotherapy neutrophils eventually recovered on day 23 500μl after beginning to recover histopathological analyses of additional specimen of surgical resections showed the expected typical pathological findings like inflammatory cells and bacteria furthermore microbiological testing confirmed esbl infection a multiplicity of operations with extended debridement was performed in order to eradicate the infection using negative pressure wound therapy after successful eradication the skin defect involved the complete lateral thigh including nearly the whole circumference of the lower leg in the further course of time the immense skin defects had to be prepared for further reconstructive surgery reconstructive surgery with mesh graft harvest was complicated by the limited residual skin available on the lower extremity and the delay on wound healing of the harvest sites due to unfavorable cytogenetics and the complicated course of treatment our patient was assigned to undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation in

"a 50 year old woman presented to the breast unit of sant’ anna and san sebastiano hospital of caserta italy after becoming aware of a non tender lump in the median areolar area of her right breast she first noticed the mass one month previously during this period she did not have any pain or discharge from the nipple further she had no family history of malignancy including breast cancer she was in antihypertensive therapy
she had never undergone any radiation and hormone replacement therapy on physical examination the patient had a demarcated mobile firm and fast growing mass in her right breast
the mass was not tender approximately 4 cm in diameter and was detected in the median areolar area of the right breast there was no clinical evidence of regional lymphadenopathy
mammography revealed an opaque and ovoid lesion occupying the median equatorial region of the right breast this lesion was 35 mm in diameter with regular margins moderate intensity and homogeneous density there was no evidence of defined focus of pathological calcification figure  ultrasonography revealed a bulky firm hypoechoic lesion with blurred and irregular margins richly vascularized on color doppler with high speed systolic flow this mass was 45 mm in diameter and referred to as a heteroplastic lesion there was no evidence of lymphadenopathy
ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration on the lesion showed epithelioid and spindle cells which were positive only to the immunohistochemical staining for vimentin and so we suspected a mesenchymal lesion
an ultrasound guided core needle biopsy performed subsequently showed connective tissue including cells similar to those already present in the needle aspirate and there were many multinuclear osteoclast like giant cells the immunohistochemical staining confirmed the mesenchymal nature of the lesion positivity for vimentin but did not indicate clearly a specific histotype for the actin cd34 and s100 protein negativity
preoperative examination consisted of a complete blood count serum kidney and liver function thyroid function test and tests for the levels of several hormones related to the development of gynecomastia including estrogen testosterone prolactin and gonadotrophic hormones as well as cancer markers cea ca 15–3 ca 125 ultrasound us of the abdomen failed to document any abnormalities an isotope bone scan did not reveal any abnormal uptake all results were within the normal limits
the patient underwent total mastectomy without axillary lymph node dissection awaiting histology
macroscopic examination of the specimen measuring 19 × 15 × 8 cm and including the normal nipple revealed a grayish apparently delimited nodular lesion measuring 10 cm in diameter with cystic necrotic and few hemorrhagic areas the lesion was 05 cm away from the fascia and 1 cm away from the skin furthermore another grayish nodular lesion measuring 15 cm was in the subcutaneous tissue
microscopic examination of the sections from the specimen showed nodular proliferation of pleomorphic spindle shaped and ovoid cells with connective tissue septa mixed with many multinuclear osteoclast like giant cells that did not show mainly malignant features figures a b figure a b
necrotic areas and abnormal mitosis were identified immunohistochemical stainings for cytokeratin pan figure a cytokeratin 7 8 18 19 ema epithelial membrane antigen s100 protein sma smooth muscle actin and cd34 were negative immunohistochemical staining for vimentin was positive figure b mitotic activity was observed with a high proliferation index assessed with ki67 moreover in the surrounding parenchymal component there were multiple foci of intraductal carcinoma evaluated with immunohistochemical staining for muscle actin and collagen iv the lesion was contained within the margins of excision
the histological and immunohistochemical findings established the diagnosis of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with osteoclast like giant cells of the breast

in the or the superior labial artery and a small outflow vein which was likely part of the superior labial venous plexus were identified and isolated from the lateral portion of the lip however the nasal segment contained no identifiable viable artery or vein therefore the nasal and eyebrow portions were replanted similarly to full thickness skin grafts and the upper lip was replanted using microvascular techniques the segments of each vessel were flushed with heparinized saline then the superior labial artery was anastomosed using 9 0 nylon interrupted sutures followed by anastomosis of the vein using 9 0 nylon after three hours and 19 minutes of operating time arterial blood flow was immediately apparent but venous flow was not definitive the wounds of the upper eyelid and right cheek were debrided and then closed
to improve the chance of tissue survival our patient was scheduled to receive hyperbaric oxygen treatment within 24 hours post operation however the patient reported that his ears could not tolerate the pressure and therapy was postponed until otolaryngology could insert tubes at the bedside additionally he was receiving 30 mg of enoxaparin daily to mitigate the chance of outflow venous thrombosis the replaced nasal and eyebrow tissue and the microsurgically replanted upper lip appeared to have some minor ischemia at the lateral margins particularly of the nasal tip that would most likely require revision but the majority of the three portions appeared healthy figure 
later that day the patient reported upper extremity numbness after a non contrast ct showed no intracranial abnormality he received 834 mg bolus of tpa followed by 751 mg of iv tpa over the course of an hour for possible ischemic stroke subsequent mri showed a small acute left frontal cortical infarction the next morning the patient reported chest discomfort and an ekg showed st segment elevation of inferior leads with elevated troponin peak of 1322 due to myocardial infarction the patient then underwent left heart catheterization that showed adequate flow and no need for further intervention after these events he received 30 mg of enoxaparin twice a day per protocol

"our patient is an 8 year old girl with a positive family history for both skeletal malformations and bipolar disorders bd her pre perinatal history was uneventful she was referred to our unit because of learning difficulties and behavioural problems the neurological examination did not show focal neurological deficits dysmorphic features were evident at the first observation she showed several facial dimorphisms such as flat face blepharophimosis hypertelorism broad nasal bridge and high palate bones and joints defects were also evident pectum excavatum single transverse palmar crease brachydactyly flat foot and stature below 25th percentile  because of these features she previously underwent genetic consultation and performed array cgh analysis revealing a chromosomic 8q221 q223 duplication hg1996846254 101630576x3 101726279x2 encompassing the gdf6 and sdc2 genes inherited from her father thus our 8 year old girl presented with clinical and genetic features of leris pleonosteosis within a larger microduplication involving different genes not strictly related to our patient phenotype in particular the hypothesis of autosomal recessive optic atrophy opa6 was excluded by a general ophthalmologic examination and a fundus examination since the contiguous region 8q2113 q221 is responsible for recessive optic atrophy 
she also met the dsm 5 criteria for attention deficithyperactivity disorder adhd specific learning disorder speech sound disorder and developmental coordination disorder in particular she showed a highly pressured pattern of speech difficulty in sustaining attention high levels of activity and low frustration tolerance furthermore she presented a pattern of bipolar like phenomena that did not meet the criteria for bipolar i bipolar ii or cyclothymic disorder nevertheless according to dsm 5 category she met the criteria for the diagnosis of “other specified bipolar and related disorder” owing to the occurrence of hypomania episode without prior major depressive episode or a manic episode
the clinical features are shared with both her father and her grandfather that present an overlapping duplication in the 8q221 q223 region they show facial dimorphism flat face blepharophimosis hypertelorism and broad nasal bridge and brachydactyly and are affected respectively by cyclothymic disorder and bipolar ii disorder also her grandfathers brother received a diagnosis of bipolar ii disorder unfortunately he has never performed an array cgh analysis but he shows skeletal malformations consistent with leris disorder along paternal line of our patient more members are affected by mood disorders associated with skeletal deformations unfortunately none of them agreed to perform the array cgh analysis thus the information is incomplete to build a family tree chart nevertheless the chromosome 8q221 microduplications were documented in our patient and his father and grandfather

a 50 year old korean man presented with a keloid scar on his anterior chest wall which had developed 1 year prior following trauma and had gradually enlarged beyond the original wounds boundaries he complained about pain and itching sensations in the keloid scar the keloid scar measured about 5 cm and was located on the sternal area a cystic lesion with a pin point sized skin opening was present at the center of the keloid scar fig a the cystic lesion was absent before the traumatic event and dermoscopic examination revealed an ec with a central skin opening fig b the patient was asked to choose which among the 2 treatment options to undergo total excision of the scar tissue including the cyst or laser therapy for the keloid and cystic lesion the patient chose the latter method first laser therapy using a 595 nm pulsed dye laser vbeam candela corporation wayland ma with a 7 mm spot size at a fluency of 12 jcm2 and a 20 ms pulse width was performed to manage the keloid scar adjacent nonoverlapping laser pulses were applied to the entire surface of the keloid scar epidermal cooling was achieved using a cryogen spray cooling device which had a spurt duration of 30 ms with a delay of 30 ms these procedures were performed 3 times with 3 week intervals second laser therapy using a carbon dioxide laser spectra sp carbon dioxide laser 20 hz 250 μs pulse width 17 mj lutronic korea to create multiple punctures resulting in a 2 to 4 mm hole was performed to manage the ec gentle pressure and squeezing led to the exudation of the cysts internal contents through the hole and the remaining visible cystic walls were cauterized using the carbon dioxide laser we applied steri strip skin closures 3 m maplewood mn to the wound without surgical sutures there were no postoperative complications such as infection or wound dehiscence the ec healed completely following the carbon dioxide laser therapy we performed 5 further pulsed dye laser cycles on the whole keloid scar fig c and d after completing the laser therapy mepiform dressing mölnlycke health care oakville ontario canada which is a self adherent soft silicone dressing designed for scar management was used by the patient for 5 months fig e and f there were no ec recurrences or keloid overgrowth during the 2 year follow up period and the patient was satisfied with the final outcome fig g,inclusion criteria patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus patients 18 years of age or older patients admitted under medical or surgical services patients treated with diet alone insulin sq insulin pump or oral hypoglycemic medications have their own continuous glucose monitoring cgm monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission exclusion criteria individuals under 18 years of age covid 19 infection infection of the skin at the cgm site requiring removal of the sensor patients with altered mental status patients unable to scan their flash cgms at least every 8 hours inability to provide written consent hospitalized for less than 24 hours,1
"the patient was a previously healthy 73 year old female who underwent curative resection for gbc pt2n0m0 according to the eighth international union against cancer tnm classification we performed next generation sequencing ngs based genomic profiling of the resected specimen using the ngs gene panel oncomine® comprehensive assay version 3 oca v3 thermo fisher scientific which revealed erbb2 ser310phe c929ct vaf 18 and tp53 ser241tyr c722ca vaf 19 mutations one year later a hepatic lesion was observed on follow up imaging and she underwent surgical total biopsy for a pathological diagnosis
a patient had no symptoms and was in good health at the time of total biopsy
the patient had no previous medical history
the patient’s physical examination was not remarkable and laboratory testing was within normal limits including tumor markers such as ca19 9 and cea
contrasted computed tomography ct showed an ill defined low attenuation lesion in the posterior lobe of the liver figure 
the hepatic lesion was histologically diagnosed as well differentiated adenocarcinoma and the histological findings of the hepatic lesion were similar to those of gbc figure  therefore the lesion was considered a metastasis moreover we performed genomic profiling from the liver tumor using the ngs panel oncomine® target test system ott thermo fisher scientific this revealed erbb2 ser310phe c929ct vaf 26 which was identical to the mutation detected in the sequencing result of the primary site thus the liver tumor was the most consistent with a metastasis of gbc rather than localized icc to evaluate her2 overexpression in tumor cells we performed immunohistochemistry of her2 which was negative her2 score 0 since tp53 was not included in the gene list of otts tp53 mutation status at the metastatic site was not assessed
the final diagnosis of the presented case is hepatic recurrence of gbc
after the total biopsy of liver metastasis she was treated with two standard chemotherapy regimens namely gemcitabine and cisplatin and ts 1 however her disease did not obtain clinical benefit from these treatments after six months from hepatic resection she was confirmed to have a progressive disease during second line chemotherapy at that time she had liver and pulmonary recurrence as well as pulmonary and inferior vena cava tumor embolism which caused tachycardia and peripheral edema
considering no standard treatment beyond second line for gbc we treated the patient with lapatinib with a combination of capecitabine lapatinib at a dose of 1250 mg per day continuously plus capecitabine at a dose of 2000 mg per square meter of body surface area on days 1 through 14 of a 21 d cycle based on the accumulating preclinical and clinical evidence that tumors with erbb2 mutation benefit from her2 targeted treatment
within a week of treatment she experienced major subjective clinical improvement which included resolution of peripheral edema after 2 cycles of treatment contrasted ct imaging showed a decrease in the size of tumor emboli and hepatic lesions figure  however after 4 cycles of treatment the patient discontinued treatment due to grade 3 mucositis mucositis was gradually subsided over two weeks after discontinuation of the treatment one month after discontinuation her disease progressed and she chose best supportive care",inclusion criteria patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus patients 18 years of age or older patients admitted under medical or surgical services patients treated with diet alone insulin sq insulin pump or oral hypoglycemic medications have their own continuous glucose monitoring cgm monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission exclusion criteria individuals under 18 years of age covid 19 infection infection of the skin at the cgm site requiring removal of the sensor patients with altered mental status patients unable to scan their flash cgms at least every 8 hours inability to provide written consent hospitalized for less than 24 hours,1
"a 40 year old woman originally from ecuador was referred to our institution for evaluation of progressive dyspnea on exertion two months prior to her presentation she was treated at an outside hospital for presumed community acquired pneumonia with symptoms of dyspnea on exertion fevers chills and productive cough after not seeing measurable improvement the patient then presented to the emergency department at another institution where a transthoracic echocardiogram tte revealed that the patient had a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology and a normal left ventricular ejection fraction lvef of 60 pericardiocentesis was performed with 700 cc of fluid removed which grew mycobacterium tuberculosis tb the patients purified protein derivative ppd skin test was positive the patient was started on anti tb therapy and discharged

"a 54 year old chinese man of han nationality a retiree went to a local hospital because of hematuria he had an abdominal computed tomography ct scan showing right renal mass and bilateral adrenal nodules he was referred to our hospital for further examination and treatment he denied any medical history except for a 4 year history of hypertension he took 5 mg amlodipine besylate every day he was married and living with his family he had smoked tobacco for 30 years and denied alcohol consumption members of his family had no history of endocrine diseases or malignant tumors
at the time of admission his temperature was 37 °c the pulse was 80 per minute and his blood pressure was 16175 mmhg his height was 168 cm and weight 64 kg there was no physical sign of cushing’s syndrome such as central obesity skin atrophy buffalo hump red striae of skin or moon face the results of his cardiovascular respiratory abdominal and neurological examinations were all unremarkable a laboratory examination table  showed an electrolyte disturbance in particular a very low serum potassium level his 24 hour urinary free cortisol was elevated the function of his thyroid gland parathyroid hormone metanephrine and normetanephrine were in normal range
the endocrine findings table  showed high plasma aldosterone level and low plasma renin concentration he then underwent a captopril challenge test which did not show suppressed level of plasma aldosterone concentration a diagnosis of pa was of no doubt on the other hand the circadian rhythm of cortisol disappeared and his serum cortisol level was not suppressed by an overnight dexamethasone suppression test odst and low dose dexamethasone suppression test lddst he was diagnosed as having scs
an abdominal ct scan revealed a mass in the parenchyma of his right kidney figs and  and there was a rounded low density mass in his right adrenal gland and a rounded low density mass in his left adrenal gland figs    and  the larger adrenal mass was approximately 26 cm × 23 cm on the left adrenal gland these findings indicated the possibility of a renal tumor and bilateral adrenocortical adenomas
sequential adrenal venous sampling avs without adrenocorticotropic hormone acth stimulation was performed next the result of avs table  reminded us that the right adrenal gland was responsible for aldosterone hypersecretion and quite possibly the left was responsible for hypercortisolism
right nephrectomy and right partial adrenalectomy were performed first the golden yellow nodule in the right adrenal was approximately 25 cm × 2 cm × 08 cm macroscopically the pathological diagnosis of the right adrenal nodule was adrenocortical adenoma the right kidney tumor was proven to be a fibroma three days after operation our patient’s serum potassium was 45 mmoll without any supplementary treatment the hypertensive drug was changed to 2 mg terazosin every day
a laparoscopic left partial adrenalectomy was conducted 1 month later when admitted to hospital his blood pressure was 12783 mmhg controlled by 2 mg terazosin every day and his level of potassium was 49 mmoll without any supplementary treatment we examined his cortisol at 8 am before operation which was 34481 nmoll the operation was successful and the level of cortisol at 8 am had reduced to 19201 nmoll 2 days after operation the nodule in the left adrenal was golden yellow it was approximately 3 cm × 25 cm × 2 cm the pathological diagnosis of the left adrenal gland nodule was proven to be adrenocortical adenoma after the second operation doctors advised 30 mg hydrocortisone should be taken once a day with a weekly reduction of 10 mg until withdrawal and 2 mg terazosin should be taken once a day
during postoperative follow up terazosin was gradually stopped and blood pressure and serum potassium remained normal approximately 2 months later his acth concentration was 9873 pgml which was above the reference value this meant our patient had adrenocortical insufficiency and he continued to take hydrocortisone months later hydrocortisone was stopped the concentration of cortisol and acth were 23346 nmoll and 4943 pgml respectively the plasma aldosterone concentration was 104 pgml and plasma renin concentration was 31 uiuml normalization of aldosterone to renin ratio arr cortisol and acth were reached and our patient did not complain of any discomfort
immunohistochemistry fig  of the two adrenal nodules revealed that the right one had positive immunostaining for cyp11b2 which is essential to synthesize aldosterone and the left one had positive immunostaining for cyp11b1 which is essential to synthesize cortisol these results confirmed the right nodule was responsible for the secretion of aldosterone and the left nodule was responsible for the secretion of cortisol somatic kcnj5 mutation leu168arg was found in the right adrenal tumor fig  and there was no kcnj5 mutation in the left adrenal tumor",inclusion criteria an out of hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm glasgow coma scale gcs score less than or equal to 8 exclusion criteria patients with pre existent terminal renal insufficiency known glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency risk of hemolysis history of urolithiasis oxalate nephropathy or hemochromatosis treatment limitations,1

best corrected visual acuity bcva was 2020 in the right eye and 8200 in the left eye funduscopy revealed round yellowish white subretinal lesions with retinal hemorrhage in both eyes 
laboratory studies showed elevated titers of the anti toxoplasma anti herpes simplex virus igg anti herpes simplex virus igm and anti cytomegalovirus igg antibodies as well as low cell lymphocyte and cd4 positive lymphocyte counts in contrast the white blood cell count c reactive protein and β d glucan levels were not increased
no abnormalities were noted on blood culture or whole body contrast computed tomography
administration of oral anti toxoplasma acetylspiramycin 1800 mgday and anti viral drugs valganciclovir 1800 mgday was initiated however the lesions expanded in both eyes
diagnostic vitrectomy of the left eye was performed 4 weeks after the initial examination although the vitreous fluid sample was subjected to broad range pcr multiplex pcr and other culture tests no positive results were obtained
based on the fundus findings broad spectrum antibiotic treatment imipenemcilastatin 2000 mgday and amikacin 600 mgday was initiated under suspicion of bacterial infections including nocardia however the lesions did not improve thus antibiotics ceftazidime 2 mg vancomycin 1 mg and voriconazole 005 mg01 ml each were injected into the vitreous cavity 6 weeks after the initial examination and a vitreous tap was simultaneously performed broad range pcr of the vitreous fluid showed 375×104 copiesml of bacterial 16s ribosomal rna strongly suggesting bacterial infection albeit with antibiotic treatment the lesions further deteriorated bcva to light perception 
seven weeks after the initial examination exenteration of the left eye was performed immediately after the operation microscopic observation of the removed and then gram stained tissue revealed gram negative rods however no bacteria corresponding to these organisms grew in culture of either the removed tissue or vitreous fluid and only c albicans was isolated sheep blood agar and chocolate agar were used for culture and intubated with 5 carbon dioxide at 35°c for 48 hours the picture of the gram stained sample was taken from this culture  left then the colonies grown on these cultures were harvested and cultivated on the chromagar® for identification the picture of the agar plate shows the colonies that are green in color on the chromagar® suggesting the species of c albicans based on its color  right
based on these findings mixed bacterial and fungal infection was considered and simultaneous systemic administrations of antibiotics levofloxacin 500 mgday and maximum dose antifungal agent fosfluconazole 600 mgday were initiated in addition antibiotics ceftazidime 2 mg vancomycin 1 mg and voriconazole 005 mg01 ml each were injected into the vitreous cavity of the right eye three times from 8 weeks to 10 weeks after the initial examination broad range pcr of the vitreous fluid obtained from simultaneous vitreous tap 8 weeks after the initial examination revealed 719×104 copiesml of bacterial 16s ribosomal rna and 185×105 copiesml of fungal 28s ribosomal rna suggesting a fungus dominant mixed infection
the subretinal abscess in the right eye expanded approaching the central fovea  and bcva decreased to 2200 vitrectomy combined with cataract surgery and silicone oil injection was performed 10 weeks after the initial examination c albicans was detected by vitreous fluid culture systemic administration of the antifungal agent was continued after surgery and the lesions healed under silicone oil  the fundus had stabilized 1 year and 4 months after the initial examination and bcva was maintained at 4200",inclusion criteria an out of hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm glasgow coma scale gcs score less than or equal to 8 exclusion criteria patients with pre existent terminal renal insufficiency known glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency risk of hemolysis history of urolithiasis oxalate nephropathy or hemochromatosis treatment limitations,1

"a 50 year old woman presented to the breast unit of sant’ anna and san sebastiano hospital of caserta italy after becoming aware of a non tender lump in the median areolar area of her right breast she first noticed the mass one month previously during this period she did not have any pain or discharge from the nipple further she had no family history of malignancy including breast cancer she was in antihypertensive therapy
she had never undergone any radiation and hormone replacement therapy on physical examination the patient had a demarcated mobile firm and fast growing mass in her right breast
the mass was not tender approximately 4 cm in diameter and was detected in the median areolar area of the right breast there was no clinical evidence of regional lymphadenopathy
mammography revealed an opaque and ovoid lesion occupying the median equatorial region of the right breast this lesion was 35 mm in diameter with regular margins moderate intensity and homogeneous density there was no evidence of defined focus of pathological calcification figure  ultrasonography revealed a bulky firm hypoechoic lesion with blurred and irregular margins richly vascularized on color doppler with high speed systolic flow this mass was 45 mm in diameter and referred to as a heteroplastic lesion there was no evidence of lymphadenopathy
ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration on the lesion showed epithelioid and spindle cells which were positive only to the immunohistochemical staining for vimentin and so we suspected a mesenchymal lesion
an ultrasound guided core needle biopsy performed subsequently showed connective tissue including cells similar to those already present in the needle aspirate and there were many multinuclear osteoclast like giant cells the immunohistochemical staining confirmed the mesenchymal nature of the lesion positivity for vimentin but did not indicate clearly a specific histotype for the actin cd34 and s100 protein negativity
preoperative examination consisted of a complete blood count serum kidney and liver function thyroid function test and tests for the levels of several hormones related to the development of gynecomastia including estrogen testosterone prolactin and gonadotrophic hormones as well as cancer markers cea ca 15–3 ca 125 ultrasound us of the abdomen failed to document any abnormalities an isotope bone scan did not reveal any abnormal uptake all results were within the normal limits
the patient underwent total mastectomy without axillary lymph node dissection awaiting histology
macroscopic examination of the specimen measuring 19 × 15 × 8 cm and including the normal nipple revealed a grayish apparently delimited nodular lesion measuring 10 cm in diameter with cystic necrotic and few hemorrhagic areas the lesion was 05 cm away from the fascia and 1 cm away from the skin furthermore another grayish nodular lesion measuring 15 cm was in the subcutaneous tissue
microscopic examination of the sections from the specimen showed nodular proliferation of pleomorphic spindle shaped and ovoid cells with connective tissue septa mixed with many multinuclear osteoclast like giant cells that did not show mainly malignant features figures a b figure a b
necrotic areas and abnormal mitosis were identified immunohistochemical stainings for cytokeratin pan figure a cytokeratin 7 8 18 19 ema epithelial membrane antigen s100 protein sma smooth muscle actin and cd34 were negative immunohistochemical staining for vimentin was positive figure b mitotic activity was observed with a high proliferation index assessed with ki67 moreover in the surrounding parenchymal component there were multiple foci of intraductal carcinoma evaluated with immunohistochemical staining for muscle actin and collagen iv the lesion was contained within the margins of excision
the histological and immunohistochemical findings established the diagnosis of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with osteoclast like giant cells of the breast

the cystic mass was adhered to the ileum but there was no definite communication to the ileum the feeding arteries of the cyst were communicating branches from the upper mesentery artery and the lymph nodes around the cyst were slightly swollen figure ac at the small bowel follow through exam the cyst did not come out but it did exclude normal intestine figure b there were not significant findings during a colonoscopic examination
based on these findings we diagnosed the cyst as an ileal duplication and decided to perform surgery in order to prevent a recurrence of abdominal pain and lethal complications such as bleeding or perforation
we employed a four port laparoscope assisted resection of the duplicated ileum and segmental resection of the normal ileum an umbilical port was used for a mini laparotomy with a zigzag skin incision figure a the cyst’s stalk was attached to the base of the mesentery of the terminal ileum approximately 40 cm from the ileocecal junction figure bc after resection of the cyst a side to side anastomosis of the ileum was made with a stapler
the resected specimen showed an ileal duplication of 18 × 7 cm in diameter filled with purulent matter with some ulcers inside figure a the histological findings showed that it had a mucus gland inside like intestinal epithelium and was covered with two layers of smooth muscle there was no communication between the duplication and normal ileum but they had a common muscle layer figure bc

"a 50 year old woman presented to the breast unit of sant’ anna and san sebastiano hospital of caserta italy after becoming aware of a non tender lump in the median areolar area of her right breast she first noticed the mass one month previously during this period she did not have any pain or discharge from the nipple further she had no family history of malignancy including breast cancer she was in antihypertensive therapy
she had never undergone any radiation and hormone replacement therapy on physical examination the patient had a demarcated mobile firm and fast growing mass in her right breast
the mass was not tender approximately 4 cm in diameter and was detected in the median areolar area of the right breast there was no clinical evidence of regional lymphadenopathy
mammography revealed an opaque and ovoid lesion occupying the median equatorial region of the right breast this lesion was 35 mm in diameter with regular margins moderate intensity and homogeneous density there was no evidence of defined focus of pathological calcification figure  ultrasonography revealed a bulky firm hypoechoic lesion with blurred and irregular margins richly vascularized on color doppler with high speed systolic flow this mass was 45 mm in diameter and referred to as a heteroplastic lesion there was no evidence of lymphadenopathy
ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration on the lesion showed epithelioid and spindle cells which were positive only to the immunohistochemical staining for vimentin and so we suspected a mesenchymal lesion
an ultrasound guided core needle biopsy performed subsequently showed connective tissue including cells similar to those already present in the needle aspirate and there were many multinuclear osteoclast like giant cells the immunohistochemical staining confirmed the mesenchymal nature of the lesion positivity for vimentin but did not indicate clearly a specific histotype for the actin cd34 and s100 protein negativity
preoperative examination consisted of a complete blood count serum kidney and liver function thyroid function test and tests for the levels of several hormones related to the development of gynecomastia including estrogen testosterone prolactin and gonadotrophic hormones as well as cancer markers cea ca 15–3 ca 125 ultrasound us of the abdomen failed to document any abnormalities an isotope bone scan did not reveal any abnormal uptake all results were within the normal limits
the patient underwent total mastectomy without axillary lymph node dissection awaiting histology
macroscopic examination of the specimen measuring 19 × 15 × 8 cm and including the normal nipple revealed a grayish apparently delimited nodular lesion measuring 10 cm in diameter with cystic necrotic and few hemorrhagic areas the lesion was 05 cm away from the fascia and 1 cm away from the skin furthermore another grayish nodular lesion measuring 15 cm was in the subcutaneous tissue
microscopic examination of the sections from the specimen showed nodular proliferation of pleomorphic spindle shaped and ovoid cells with connective tissue septa mixed with many multinuclear osteoclast like giant cells that did not show mainly malignant features figures a b figure a b
necrotic areas and abnormal mitosis were identified immunohistochemical stainings for cytokeratin pan figure a cytokeratin 7 8 18 19 ema epithelial membrane antigen s100 protein sma smooth muscle actin and cd34 were negative immunohistochemical staining for vimentin was positive figure b mitotic activity was observed with a high proliferation index assessed with ki67 moreover in the surrounding parenchymal component there were multiple foci of intraductal carcinoma evaluated with immunohistochemical staining for muscle actin and collagen iv the lesion was contained within the margins of excision
the histological and immunohistochemical findings established the diagnosis of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with osteoclast like giant cells of the breast

"a previously healthy 8 month old boy presented with a 3×3 cm mass in the right lower leg which was surgically excised pathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of infantile fibrosarcoma and the surgical margin was not clear his parents refused reexcision but accepted monitoring by regular imaging however a mass was detected again in the same area two years after surgery therefore the patient then underwent complete excision and recurrent sarcoma was confirmed histologically after the second resection the patient had monthly follow up and no evidence of disease was observed on an ongoing one year
a surveillance whole body fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan conducted 3 years after the initial presentation demonstrated a recurrent mass in the right lower leg one micrometastatic lesions at the left proximal fibula and another macrometastasis in the 4th lumbar vertebral column respectively lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging mri revealed a contrast enhancing lesion of 16 cm in the posterior aspect of the 4th lumbar vertebral column without spinal canal compression  to preserve right lower leg debulking surgery of the recurrent lesion was performed and the histological features were found to be consistent with recurrent sarcoma with rhabomyosarcomatous differentiation two weeks after the surgery the patient started to receive chemotherapy with a vac regimen composed of vincristine 15 mgm2 dactinomycin 0045 mgkg and cyclophosphamide 22 gm2 for a total of 44 weeks treatment course
given the potential risk of spinal pathologic fracture and myelopathy radiotherapy was chosen to treat the 4th lumbar vertebral metastatic lesion cyberknife® hypofractionated radiotherapy was decided due to the solitary nature of the metastasis and fewer sessions are needed which would decrease the frequency of general anesthesia for radiotherapy the patient was immobilized in a vacuum mattress fused enhanced computed tomography ct accuray and mri scans were used in the treatment planning the delineation of the gross tumor volume gtv and the organs at risk was carried out on the planning ct given the potential risk of kyphosis and scoliosis by asymmetric irradiation of the spine the whole involved vertebra was contoured as the gtv clinical target volume was equal to the gtv and no margin was added to obtain the planning target volume ptv which was 884 ml no fiducial or other markers were implanted to localize the irradiated area a total of 26 gy was prescribed to the 75 isodose line covering 9264 of the ptv with a maximal spinal cord dose of 74426 cgy  cyberknife® stereotactic body radiotherapy was performed on the 15th 16th 19th and 20th of october 2009 with a mean procedure time of 83 min range 56 min to 128 min the radiotherapy course was conducted in a manner concomitant with the first cycle of chemotherapy during the radiotherapy immobilization was aided by general anesthesia and x sight spine tracking accuray inc was used to minimize setup error

"this patient is a 29 year old white woman from the usa with a medical history significant for severe ibs d diagnosed at age 12 and anxiety disorder in july 2015 she presented with severe bleeding hemorrhoids secondary to ibs which required hemorrhoidectomy and anal sphincterotomy in august 2015 the week before the surgery she developed pharyngitis and was treated with azithromycin which resulted in mucousy diarrhea and abdominal discomfort she tested negative for c difficile antigen and toxins at that time
a week after surgery she developed a perirectal abscess that had formed at the site of the sphincterotomy and was prescribed orally administered ciprofloxacin despite moderate symptom improvement in september 2015 she required an abscess incision and drainage procedure and penrose drain insertion prior to the surgery she was given a single dose of clindamycin an additional 2 week course of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole was then prescribed in late september 2015 she was admitted to the hospital for two nights due to further complications related to the abscess and was then diagnosed as having a perianal fistula
in november 2015 she was prescribed clindamycin for an episode of group c streptococcal positive pharyngitis in late november 2015 she was also diagnosed as having ehlers–danlos syndrome which according to her medical record may partially explain the poor wound healing from the perirectal abscess in december 2015 her fistula required an anus seton placement she was treated with multiple courses of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole off and on from december 2015 to january 2016

"a 31 year old female patient was admitted to the vascular medicine department of the hôpital européen georges pompidou for an acute ischemia of the left hand she presented with necrosis of the intermediate and distal phalanges of the second third fourth and fifth fingers of her left hand
three days earlier the patient turned up at the primary care center close to her home for a sudden and constant pain in her left hand she was discharged within 2 h with painkillers after 72 h cyanosis and coldness of the intermediate and distal phalanges of the fingers of the left hand appeared she then decided to consult at the hôpital européen georges pompidou emergency department
left hand examination revealed the following injuries cyanosis and coldness of the intermediate and distal phalanges of the fifth finger necrosis of the distal phalanges of the second third and fourth fingers phlyctens of the intermediate phalanges of the second third and fourth fingers and the proximal phalanges of the fourth finger  the hand was still painful with paresthesia but without fingers paralysis upper limb pulses were present and symmetrical injection marks were noted at the bend of the right and left elbows cardiac auscultation was normal without any bruit that could evoke an infective endocarditis and she had no fever electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm without any abnormalities
in her medical history she had no cardiovascular history but active smoking as her only cardiovascular risk factor spontaneously she mentioned being a drug addict but weaned off ectasy codein and cannabis and currently in a weaning off program for heroin she had been prescribed tapered doses of buprenorphine but still used to take bromazepam and zolpidem off the counter
the continuous doppler confirmed the presence of flow in the left radial ulnar and palmar arteries a digital subtraction angiography was rapidly performed which demonstrated no run off in the digital arteries of the second third and fourth left fingers  no thromboaspiration could be performed on these too small arteries anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin was started
the patient was transferred to the vascular medicine department for medical therapy and further investigations as the patient denied any recent intravenous drug injection a complete screening for acute limb ischemia etiology was performed
human immunodeficient virus and hepatitis b virus serology were negative whereas hepatitis c virus serology came back positive several analyses to find a cryoglobulinemia returned negative

"the case was of a 22 year old woman complaining of headache for 18 months with severe episodes lasting around 6 hours recurring about twice a month pain was located on the parietal regions spreading to the orbit attacks were accompanied by nausea severe enough to hinder routine activities the case was assessed by several specialists ruling out neurological ophthalmological and otorhinolaryngological pathologies cranial computed tomography ct and magnetic resonance imaging mri revealed no pathology previous treatments considered nonsteroidal analgesics physical therapy hot and ice packs applications and low level laser therapy all of them did not relieve pain to a satisfactory level her neurologist referred her to the orthodontic clinic suspecting a dilemma somewhere in her braces the patient had fixed orthodontic appliance in the lower arch only with right first premolar extracted and space was closed with a satisfactory treatment outcome
clinical examination showed good oral hygiene with no signs of periodontal disease panoramic radiography opg was normal occlusion was normal with no temporomandibular joint disorders however the patient reported that headache started 4 weeks after brackets bonding at this stage the patient was referred to a specialized center to test salivary biochemistry particularly nickel and chromium levels the chemical analyses were performed with a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer using unstimulated salivary sample
after consultation with patients neurologist a decision was made to remove braces as soon as possible and provide her with a cadcam zirconium bar as a bonded mandibular fixed retainer as the patient refused to wear any removable appliance the treatment objectives were to 1 remove braces and retain teeth at their present position and 2 fabricate a bonded mandibular fixed retainer being biocompatible in attempt to relieve the patients complaint
occlusal rests of 2 mm depth were prepared on the mesial surface of first premolars brackets were covered with wax prior to impression taking to facilitate its removal a definitive impression of the mandibular teeth was made with an alginate impression material and the master model was prepared from type iv stone resinrock whip mix europe dortmund germany the working cast was mounted on articulator and scanned in the s600 arti scanner ice zirkon zirkonzahn za9246a italy to transfer the baseline landmarks from the mandibular arch directly to the software  the cadcam design included a 18 mm width and a 14 mm thickness zirconium bar extended on the lingual surface of lower teeth from canine to canine and at 35 mm away from the free gingival margin occlusal rests were connected to the bar as well  the finished design was directly milled using zirkonzahns screw tec system
zirconium does not chemically adhere to enamel therefore the inner surface of the milled bar facing teeth was reduced manually and placed under an infrared lamp to dry for 40 minutes and then sintered overnight at 1600°c in a sintering furnace zirkonofen 700 later a thin layer of feldspathic ceramic was fired onto the bar  and subsequently received the treatments sandblast hydrofluoric acid etching and silane coupling while the outer part was glazed  the try of insertion of the entire bar into the patients mouth proceeded properly ensuring good marginal fitness the retainer was cemented with two dual cured cement types variolink ii and relyx arc the occlusal rest on the left side needed minimal reduction 
salivary spectrophotometry analysis showed that nickel concentration was 4230 μgl and chromium was 12520 μgl these concentrations were much lower than estimated toxic levels but comparable to the average dietary intake of nickel 200–300 μgday and chromium 280 μgday  several in vitro studies found that release reached a maximum within the first month of boding and then diminished due to formation of surface oxide film which resists corrosion thus slowing down the release of metals  however the case is different here where measurable amounts of nickel and chromium release were recorded after 22 months of treatment alerting possible association with the complaint
the patient reported pain relief two weeks following cementation and headache subsided completely after 6 weeks another atomic absorption spectrometer analysis was performed to test salivary nickel and chromium levels which showed negligible concentrations which might explain the patients complaint the patient was reviewed regularly for two years reporting no complaint  clinical evaluation appeared to give good functional value where the marginal fit of digitized cadcam design and glazed surface offered an enhanced approach of fixed retention",inclusion criteria age greater than or equal to 18 years sustained rosc within 60 minutes of arrest patient is comatose unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands after resuscitation exclusion criteria cerebral perfusion partially or fully dependant functional status prior to index cardiac event acute traumatic brain injury sah massive stroke or intracranial hemorrhage initiation of monitoring is not feasible for logistical reasons urgent surgery planned severe co morbidity or terminal illness which makes survival to 3 months unlikely pregnancy,1

the patient underwent lc performed by a senior surgical trainee with an intraoperative cholangiogram showing no filling defects in the biliary ducts and free flow of contrast into the duodenum during the operation the gallbladder was inadvertently opened whilst dissecting it from the liver bed resulting in spillage of the large calculus while retrieving the gallbladder specimen in an endoscopic bag the spilled calculus was left inadvertently in the peritoneal cavity the operator did not realize that the spilled stone was unretrieved the patient made an uneventful gradual recovery and was discharged on postoperative day 1 macroscopic histopathology report revealed a partially opened gallbladder with no gallstone within the lumen suggesting that the spilled large calculus was not retrieved from the peritoneal cavity microscopically it was consistent with acute and chronic cholecystitis with muscle hypertrophy and fibrosis of the wall

"a 78 year old woman was referred to our clinic with bilateral hearing loss with sound distortion tinnitus and auditory hypersensitivity recurrent vertigodizziness induced by loud noises tullio phenomenon and a diagnosis of bilateral sscd at the temporal bone hrct performed in the emergency room figures 2a–c
preoperative audiometry indicated severe mixed hearing loss in the right ear with moderate conductive hearing impairment in the left ear  a pure tone sound of 110 db at 500 and 1000 hz in the right ear and pneumatically increasing external auditory canal pressure induced dizziness without detectable nystagmus on video oculographic or frenzel goggles examination her tympanogram was bilaterally normal a stapedial reflex could not be performed due to patient intolerance dizziness mastoid vibration elicited dizziness without detectable nystagmus on video oculographic or frenzel goggles examination a temporal bone 15 t mri with 3d reconstruction performed two months before did not show the bilateral dehiscence  air conduction cervical vemps cvemps demonstrated a threshold of 85 db hl on the right side and 100 db hl on the left side the cvemps were recorded from both ears using 500 hz short tone bursts stbs a video head impulse test for horizontal and vertical canals including both dehiscent ssc showed normal vestibulo ocular reflex gain bilaterally 
possible surgical procedures superior canal plugging or resurfacing either through a middle fossa approach or via a transmastoid route or rw niche plugging were discussed with the patient comorbid cardiopulmonary conditions represented major contraindications for general anesthesia so the latter procedure was the only possible option to pursue
since the patient did not show bilaterally any benefit from an air conduction hearing aid but rather had deteriorating auditory and vestibular symptoms on the right we decided to perform the surgical procedure in the right ear as it had worse vestibular and auditory symptoms a poorer hearing threshold and greatly altered hrct and vemps findings
with local assisted anesthesia we performed a transcanal approach with elevation of the tympanomeatal flap and preservation of the chorda tympani nerve with a minimally invasive retroauricular incision ossicular mobility and continuity were assessed we excluded the stapedial fixation and no cerebrospinal fluid csf leak was observed during the surgical procedure after identification and reshaping of the rw niche a vibroplasty was performed paying particular attention to correctly plugging the round window and coupling it with the floating mass transducer fmt of the vsb  we opted to couple the fmt with the rw because concomitant rw plugging was performed and from previous studies it seemed to provide a more stable coupling over time than incus  no ossicular chain abnormalities or perilymphatic fistula were observed intraoperatively
the plugging of the round window was achieved using cartilage and perichondrium tragus this autologous tissue also helped to seal off the fmt in the round window niche furthermore vsb hearing outcomes were monitored with electrocochleography using a cotton wick recording electrode placed on the hypotympanum  
the wire of the vsb was housed in a canal tunnel drilled up to the tympanic attic minimal drilling of the cortical temporal bone posterosuperior to the external auditory meatus was necessary to house the implant receiver and extra wire  the ear canal tunnel was covered with autologous cartilage and external auditory meatus packing was performed

"the case was of a 22 year old woman complaining of headache for 18 months with severe episodes lasting around 6 hours recurring about twice a month pain was located on the parietal regions spreading to the orbit attacks were accompanied by nausea severe enough to hinder routine activities the case was assessed by several specialists ruling out neurological ophthalmological and otorhinolaryngological pathologies cranial computed tomography ct and magnetic resonance imaging mri revealed no pathology previous treatments considered nonsteroidal analgesics physical therapy hot and ice packs applications and low level laser therapy all of them did not relieve pain to a satisfactory level her neurologist referred her to the orthodontic clinic suspecting a dilemma somewhere in her braces the patient had fixed orthodontic appliance in the lower arch only with right first premolar extracted and space was closed with a satisfactory treatment outcome
clinical examination showed good oral hygiene with no signs of periodontal disease panoramic radiography opg was normal occlusion was normal with no temporomandibular joint disorders however the patient reported that headache started 4 weeks after brackets bonding at this stage the patient was referred to a specialized center to test salivary biochemistry particularly nickel and chromium levels the chemical analyses were performed with a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer using unstimulated salivary sample
after consultation with patients neurologist a decision was made to remove braces as soon as possible and provide her with a cadcam zirconium bar as a bonded mandibular fixed retainer as the patient refused to wear any removable appliance the treatment objectives were to 1 remove braces and retain teeth at their present position and 2 fabricate a bonded mandibular fixed retainer being biocompatible in attempt to relieve the patients complaint
occlusal rests of 2 mm depth were prepared on the mesial surface of first premolars brackets were covered with wax prior to impression taking to facilitate its removal a definitive impression of the mandibular teeth was made with an alginate impression material and the master model was prepared from type iv stone resinrock whip mix europe dortmund germany the working cast was mounted on articulator and scanned in the s600 arti scanner ice zirkon zirkonzahn za9246a italy to transfer the baseline landmarks from the mandibular arch directly to the software  the cadcam design included a 18 mm width and a 14 mm thickness zirconium bar extended on the lingual surface of lower teeth from canine to canine and at 35 mm away from the free gingival margin occlusal rests were connected to the bar as well  the finished design was directly milled using zirkonzahns screw tec system
zirconium does not chemically adhere to enamel therefore the inner surface of the milled bar facing teeth was reduced manually and placed under an infrared lamp to dry for 40 minutes and then sintered overnight at 1600°c in a sintering furnace zirkonofen 700 later a thin layer of feldspathic ceramic was fired onto the bar  and subsequently received the treatments sandblast hydrofluoric acid etching and silane coupling while the outer part was glazed  the try of insertion of the entire bar into the patients mouth proceeded properly ensuring good marginal fitness the retainer was cemented with two dual cured cement types variolink ii and relyx arc the occlusal rest on the left side needed minimal reduction 
salivary spectrophotometry analysis showed that nickel concentration was 4230 μgl and chromium was 12520 μgl these concentrations were much lower than estimated toxic levels but comparable to the average dietary intake of nickel 200–300 μgday and chromium 280 μgday  several in vitro studies found that release reached a maximum within the first month of boding and then diminished due to formation of surface oxide film which resists corrosion thus slowing down the release of metals  however the case is different here where measurable amounts of nickel and chromium release were recorded after 22 months of treatment alerting possible association with the complaint
the patient reported pain relief two weeks following cementation and headache subsided completely after 6 weeks another atomic absorption spectrometer analysis was performed to test salivary nickel and chromium levels which showed negligible concentrations which might explain the patients complaint the patient was reviewed regularly for two years reporting no complaint  clinical evaluation appeared to give good functional value where the marginal fit of digitized cadcam design and glazed surface offered an enhanced approach of fixed retention",inclusion criteria an out of hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm glasgow coma scale gcs score less than or equal to 8 exclusion criteria patients with pre existent terminal renal insufficiency known glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency risk of hemolysis history of urolithiasis oxalate nephropathy or hemochromatosis treatment limitations,1

"a 24 year old unmarried female patient presented to us with a persistent fistula in the right iliac fossa following an appendicectomy done in another hospital 6 weeks previously on further questioning she informed us that she had presented to this hospital with a 2 week history of abdominal pain confined to the right lower abdomen she complained of general ill health and occasional altered bowel habits for 6 months prior to this acute episode
an enquiry with the doctors who had initially seen her revealed that at the time of presentation for acute appendicitis she was quite unwell with fever tachycardia and dehydration her abdomen was tender all over with guarding more pronounced over the right lower half her white cell count was 24 × 109l an x ray of her abdomen showed a few fluid levels and an ultrasound scan revealed free fluid in the abdomen with an associated right iliac fossa mass
a diagnosis of pelvic peritonitis secondary to acute appendicitis was made by the physicians and she was taken up for surgery after adequate resuscitation the abdomen was approached through a right mcburneys incision there was pus in the abdomen with an appendicular mass and the appendix appeared oedematous thickened and congested an appendicectomy was carried out followed by a thorough irrigation of the abdominal cavity the abdomen was closed after placing a drain which was removed on the 3rd post operative day in spite of antibiotic administration she developed a wound infection and persistent pyrexia she was managed conservatively with antibiotics and anti inflammatory medication and eventually improved except for a persistent purulent discharge from the wound she then decided to seek our opinion and was admitted under our care for further investigation and management
the appendicular histopathology was retrieved from the previous hospital and revealed transmural inflammation with granulomas suggestive of crohns disease a computerized tomography ct scan of the abdomen carried out in our hospital showed pericaecal collection with an inflammatory mass in front of the caecum 
the abdomen was surgically explored through the previous incision after excising the fistula leading into the caecum an inflammatory mass associated with the caecum was noted the appendicular stump had not healed and was draining into a cavity which was communicating with the wound indicating a complex enterocutaneous fistula a limited right hemicolectomy was carried out and continuity established with a primary anastomosis of macroscopically appearing healthy bowel of the ascending colon and terminal ileum a specimen of the resected caecum revealed the cobblestone appearance of the mucosa strongly suggesting the possibility of underlying caecal crohns disease  the histology was reported as inflammatory bowel disease ibd consistent with crohns disease  the patients post operative recovery was uneventful she was referred to a gastroenterologist and was being treated with mesasalazine and a regular annual colonoscopy when last seen at two years post surgery she continued to remain in good health",inclusion criteria age greater than or equal to 18 years sustained rosc within 60 minutes of arrest patient is comatose unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands after resuscitation exclusion criteria cerebral perfusion partially or fully dependant functional status prior to index cardiac event acute traumatic brain injury sah massive stroke or intracranial hemorrhage initiation of monitoring is not feasible for logistical reasons urgent surgery planned severe co morbidity or terminal illness which makes survival to 3 months unlikely pregnancy,1

"a 50 year old female patient known case of hypertension htn and taking normatin as a medication was in her usual state of health until 6 months prior to admission when she started to complain from headache tinnitus and vertigo she sought medical advice and was treated as otitis media according to the patient
before ten days from her admission to our hospital she had episodes of imbalance while she was walking and recurrent vomiting
once again she sought medical help and after a brain ct and a brain mri were done the doctors found a left cerebellar tumor  in the upcoming days she was referred to our hospital in april 2019 for further evaluation and surgical management
the patient came to our hospital by her own using public transportation because there were no facilities for the tumor management in other places and there was no need to being transported by ambulance
we did a physical examination focused on a neurological examination due to her symptoms and diagnosis the patient was conscious oriented and alert with a glasgow coma scale gcs of 1515
the cranial nerves were intact and she was positive for cerebellar signs she also was positive for the romberg sign had an ataxic gait and could not perform the tandem gait
the patient then underwent surgery in which a midline suboccipital craniectomy with microscopic gross total resection gtr of the left cerebellar tumor and a cranioplasty under neuromonitoring was performed successfully
the surgery was smooth and without intraoperative complications with an estimated blood loss of 500 cc
after the surgery the patient was transferred to the icu in good conditions with stable vital signs conscious oriented alert and a gcs of 1515 the cranial nerves were intact she was able to move all limbs freely and the wound was dry and clean afterwards she was discharged in good conditions with stable vital signs and no complications or sequela
according to the histology department the specimen that they received in formalin consisted of a multiple pieces and fragments of a grayish tissue measuring in aggregate 75 × 5 cm grossly further microscopic investigations of the histologic sections showed a biphasic tumor with a mixture of neurocytes and lipidized cells in which the neurocytes were arranged in density cellular sheets of monotonous cells with scanty and often clear cytoplasm rounded to oval nuclei and salt and pepper chromatin lipidized cells were clustered and resembling mature adipocytes
rare mitotic figures were noted and were investigated the tumor cells were positive for synaptophysin and neuron specific enolase esn immunostains focal for glial fibrillary acidic protein gfap and negative for epithelial membrane antigen ema
with all these histological findings it was concluded that the sample was consistent with a cerebellar liponeurocytoma who grade 2
after a month from the operation the patient came to the out patient clinic for follow up in which we could see that she was in good conditions with no complains and the cerebellar signs were gone since there was no residual tumor left after the surgery and there were no symptoms showing us cerebellar involvement there was no need for our patient to take radiotherapy once she was discharged
since the patient did not come to us again we suspect that she is not complaining from any other symptom in the neurosurgical field",inclusion criteria age greater than or equal to 18 years sustained rosc within 60 minutes of arrest patient is comatose unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands after resuscitation exclusion criteria cerebral perfusion partially or fully dependant functional status prior to index cardiac event acute traumatic brain injury sah massive stroke or intracranial hemorrhage initiation of monitoring is not feasible for logistical reasons urgent surgery planned severe co morbidity or terminal illness which makes survival to 3 months unlikely pregnancy,1

"a 68 years old male had undergone total mesorectal excision 10 years before a skeletal metastasis of the lower leg was diagnosed the patient was otherwise healthy except mild hypertension and there was no familial accumulation of endocrine or malignant diseases histology from the primary surgery showed a 5 cm intermediately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the rectum with no signs of neuroendocrine biology the tumor was ck7 negative and ck20 positive distance to the nearest circumferential margin was 3 mm and end resection margins were clear there was no infiltration in the removed lymph nodes nor signs of distant metastases thus the final tnm status was pt3n0m0 total calcium was normal 237 mmoll carcinoembryonic antigen cea dropped from 180 μgl preoperatively to 15 μgl after surgery no neo adjuvant or adjuvant radiochemotherapy was given during the primary treatment he underwent standard follow up regimen with bloodwork rectoscopies ultrasound of the liver and chest x ray for 4 years without any signs of relapse cea values were stable under 20 μgl and only 10 μgl when follow up was completed
ten years after surgery the patient presented with a tumor in the lower leg x ray and magnetic resonance imaging showed a 44 cm osteolytic lesion of the fibular head in addition to a 47 cm tumor in the left lung and paratracheal pathological lymph nodes biopsies of the fibular head confirmed adenocarcinoma negative for ck7 and positive for ck20 and the pathologist concluded metastasis from the rectal cancer the histological pattern was similar to the previously resected rectal tumor fig  cea had now increased to 154 μgl he was treated by radiation therapy to the leg 8 gy × 1 and commenced chemotherapy fluorouracil irinotecan calcium folinate and bevacizumab his lung pathology stabilized during this treatment and he reported less pain from the leg after the radiation therapy however the fibular tumor progressed radiologically and was 7 cm in diameter when it was resected 15 months after discovery resection margins were uncertain and he developed a wound infection with a chronic fistula to the skin
three months later the patient presented with hypercalcemia after being normocalcemic during all previous follow up due to rapidly growing inguinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes he started treatment with fluorouracil leucovorin and oxaliplatin flox ct scan showed stable disease after three cycles of therapy bloodwork revealed that cea had increased markedly to 380 μgl he developed severe hypercalcemia with free ionized calcium reaching 181 mmoll total calcium 333 mmoll concurrent with peaks in cea and pth levels fig  creatinine and estimated gfr was normal phosphorus was low 062 mmoll and 125 dihydroxyvitamin d was low 24 nmoll he had no arrhythmias or other clinical symptoms related to the hypercalcemia fluid therapy and zoledronic acid had only short lasting effect on the calcium levels pthrp was negative but intact pth was elevated to 544 pmoll normal range 11–75 pmoll the lab used a standard two site immunoassay for measurement of the 84 amino acid long pth requiring binding in both the n and c terminals for detection the high pth led us to consider primary hyperparathyroidism as a differential diagnosis ultrasound of the neck and parathyroid scintigraphy with 900 mbq of 99mtc methoxyisobutylisonitrile mibi showed no signs of parathyroid adenomas the diagnostic challenge was to distinguish primary hyperparathyroidism from ectopic pth production in a colorectal bone metastasis or potentially another tumor
to investigate if the tumor of the fibular head was responsible for the pth elevation we biopsied the tumor and stained for pth no significant staining was observed using monoclonal antibody immunohistochemistry because such a large tumor can contain different clones of cells a negative biopsy does not rule out that pth could be produced from a part of the tumor not represented in the biopsy also pth immunohistochemistry on bone biopsies could be false negative for unknown technical reasons we therefore measured blood pth levels while excluding the lower right leg from the circulation by use of a blood pressure cuff on the thigh modified casanova test  fig a pth levels measured in blood samples from the arm fell rapidly during the 20 min of right leg ischemia consistent with local pth production from the fibular tumor fig b
we concluded that the diagnosis was hypercalcemia caused by pth secretion from the bone metastasis in the fibular head and focused further treatment against the fibular tumor the osteoclast inhibitor denosumab 120 mg was administered subcutaneously and further radiotherapy was given to the lower leg 3 gy × 10 this made free calcium level stabilize at values around 140 mmoll and pth was also attenuated fig  the patient received further cycles with fliribevacizumab until a year before his death six months before the patient died another surge in pth and calcium levels arose now the patient received another course of radiotherapy 4 gy × 5 towards his fibula followed by a drop in pth levels and normalization of calcium levels no adverse events or side effects were reported by the patients or treating clinicians the patient did not develop further episodes of severe hypercalcemia during the remainder of his life and died approximately 24 months after the first incident of severe hypercalcemia due to disseminated disease involving skin lymph nodes lung pancreas and brain
as immunohistochemistry failed to show pth in the fibular bone metastasis we analyzed messenger ribonucleic acid mrna from the same biopsies post mortem despite the long interval from biopsy to rna extraction 5–16 years we were able to extract total rna from formalin fixed paraffine embedded ffpe tissue sections and quantified pth by reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr we found evidence of pth transcription in both the original rectal specimen and in the fibular biopsy taken after onset of hypercalcemia but not in the fibular biopsy that was taken before onset of hypercalcemia nor in ipsilateral inguinal lymph node metastasis fig  this is consistent with development of clinically significant pth production within the fibular metastasis after local recurrence and radiation therapy to the lower leg",inclusion criteria an out of hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm glasgow coma scale gcs score less than or equal to 8 exclusion criteria patients with pre existent terminal renal insufficiency known glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency risk of hemolysis history of urolithiasis oxalate nephropathy or hemochromatosis treatment limitations,1

in september 2016 she presented with oppressive headache with left predominance photophobia and nausea lasting for 6 days the intensity of the pain was 8 out of 10 on a visual analog scale vas she also complained of cervical discomfort a computed tomography angiography cta showed left internal carotid artery dissection extended between the upper cervical and supraclinoid segments figures and  no ischemic brain damage was observed therefore she was admitted to the emergency department and aspirin orally was administered in doses of 250 mg at bed time there were no focal neurological signs on physical examination the patient had good spatial–temporal orientation and was afebrile
we attributed the headache to both the left internal carotid artery dissection and the migraine there was an insufficient response to a combination of ketoprofen and metamizole iv thus intravenous betamethasone was added to the treatment regimen to provide a rescue medication for the refractory pain however the patient showed only a partial response after a 3 day course she was then prescribed oral topiramate 50 mg two times a day as preventive therapy and naproxen sodium 550 mg as acute treatment option
one week later a new cta was performed and showed no changes compared to the previous imaging

oral rehabilitation with removable prosthesis mandibular complete denture and maxillary removable partial dentures was planned with frequent follow up and multiple prosthesis to accommodate age changes the first visit was purely introductory the parents were explained the plan of treatment the procedure of denture fabrication closely paralleled that for the conventional denture technique but with a few notable exceptions initial impressions were made in modeling compound dpi pinnacle mumbai india custom acrylic resin trays were fabricated from the resultant casts a wax spacer was adapted over the nonstress bearing areas the maxillary and mandibular trays verified for accuracy and were border molded with green stick compound dpi pinnacle tracing sticks mumbai india the final wash impressions were obtained with zinc oxide eugenol dpi impression paste mumbai india temporary record bases were fabricated using cold cure acrylic resin followed by wax occlusion rims over them the pattern denture base was verified intraorally for accuracy and jaw relations were recorded the mandibular rest position was estimated extraorally and the upper lip was used as a guide for the location of the incisal edges of the upper anterior teeth the orientation of occlusal plane was kept lower than the level of the mandibular foramen unlike the occlusal plane in the adult patient teeth arrangement was done following conventional technique no attempt was made to balance the occlusion during the try in appointment it was observed that the part of incisal edge of the maxillary right permanent central incisor had erupted above the gingival margin and was interfering with the retention of the maxillary temporary denture base as it had not pierced through the gingiva till the secondary impression was made a window was created just palatal to maxillary right deciduous incisors and canine to accommodate the erupting permanent tooth  furthermore the right maxillary anterior had to be placed more labially for the same reason try in was done and the childs joy to see his artificial teeth was very obvious dentures were processed with heat cured acrylic resin following compression molding technique and polished the maxillary removable partial denture retention was assisted with clasps on deciduous second molars at the insertion appointment the complete incisal edge of the maxillary permanent right central incisor had erupted in the oral cavity so further widening of the window created to accommodate the erupting tooth was done the maxillary partial and mandibular complete dentures were inserted figures and  instructions about oral hygiene were given and the parents were asked to supervise the childs oral hygiene the patient was advised to maintain a soft diet for the first few days and to remove the dentures at night and during the sports activities recall appointments were scheduled for 24 h and then weekly
the parents reported no problem in retention of the prosthesis initially the patient had some difficulty in accepting the dentures and was unable to keep them in the mouth for long periods however shortly he was fully adjusted to using the dentures patient was on a monthly recall schedule for continuous monitoring to track the eruption of 11 and observe the status of 21 and to allow the necessary adjustments of his denture to accommodate the erupting permanent toothteeth the maxillary permanent right central incisor erupted completely through the window in the prosthesis after 2 years the patient reported difficulty in wearing the dentures the dentures were replaced with the new prosthesis following the technique as earlier accommodating the erupted permanent right incisor and the growth changes in the jaws  no change in the status of the unerupted 21 was observed
at the beginning of therapy the patient was quiet and withdrawn he became communicative and his speech skills improved after the insertion of dentures development of a good psychological self image was achieved through the esthetic improvement facial profile and expression improved with the prosthesis the cosmetic effect alone seemed to transform the patient into a socially acceptable individual future treatment will include relining rebasing or remaking of the dentures to accommodate growth and development and definitive restorations at an appropriate age",inclusion criteria patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 age 65 years or older to be under follow up in the same center for at least one year exclusion criteria younger than 65 years old having decompensated liver disease psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy,1

"a 49 year old male presented with a history of bomb blast injury to his left elbow 25 years back when he had sustained an open and comminuted fracture of left distal humerus with extension into the elbow joint the injury was treated with wound debridement and cast application for 6 weeks distal humerus progressed to atrophic non union with severe deformity and stiffness of the elbow he also had partial involvement of radial and ulnar nerves with stiffness and deformities of the fingers of the left hand he presented to us for correction of the elbow deformity and to gain reasonable elbow and hand function
on local examination there were multiple scars present medially laterally and posteriorly around his left elbow suggestive of healed wounds by secondary intention after compound injury there was fixed flexion deformity of the elbow of 900 with further flexion up to 120 degree was possible   there was partial sensory loss in the little and ring fingers and the muscle power as per mrc grading of the finger flexors was 35 wrist and those of elbow flexors was 25 the motor power of left fingers wrist and elbow extensors were 15
plain radiographs revealed atrophic non union of the supracondylar fracture along with the deformity at the distal humerus due to malunited distal humeral fracture   ct scan confirmed these radiographic findings and demonstrated a significant gap at the fracture site with grossly rotated distal humeral condylar fragments and marked disuse osteopenia
in view of grossly distorted anatomy of the distal humerus poor bone stock bone gap at the non united fracture severe elbow deformity and stiffness we preferred to go for a mega prosthetic replacement of the left elbow under general anaesthesia elbow was approached posteriorly by ’wadsworth approach’ and the fracture site was exposed severe fibrosis was encountered between the fractured ends of the bone which was excised the distal humeral condylar fragments were found to be grossly mal positioned osteoporosed destructed and were not amenable to osteosynthesis or conventional total elbow replacement hence the distal humeral bone fragments were excised leading to a large bone gap at the elbow this gap was reconstructed by using elbow mega prosthesis preparation for mega prosthetic replacement was done by reaming the humeral and ulnar shafts cemented titanium prosthesis xlo tm was used for reconstruction with ulnar stem of 132 mm and humeral stem of 175 mm length the implant had eyes in the ulnar component for the attachment of the triceps tendon common flexor tendons were attached on the medial side and the common extensor tendons were attached on lateral side of triceps tendon and finally the combined tendinous complex was attached at the eye of the prosthesis with the help of non absorbable polyester suture ethibond™ no 5 intra operatively we could achieve good correction of the elbow deformity with rom of 10 1500 with stable elbow joint
the patient was given iv third generation cephalosporin and aminoglycoside for a period of three days post operatively the antibiotics were shifted to oral at the time of discharge and were continued for a period of two weeks till suture removal the limb was kept in a splint for 2 weeks followed by physical therapy to regain the movements and function of the elbow and hand   the post operative recovery was satisfactory and uneventful post operative x ray showed good placement of the prosthesis with adequate cementation  
at 12 months follow up the the patient had significant improvement in the post operative mayo elbow score of 80 compared to pre operative score of only 50 the patient could now do many of his activities of daily living with left hand which were not possible before apart from significant improvement in the cosmetic appearance",inclusion criteria age greater than or equal to 18 years sustained rosc within 60 minutes of arrest patient is comatose unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands after resuscitation exclusion criteria cerebral perfusion partially or fully dependant functional status prior to index cardiac event acute traumatic brain injury sah massive stroke or intracranial hemorrhage initiation of monitoring is not feasible for logistical reasons urgent surgery planned severe co morbidity or terminal illness which makes survival to 3 months unlikely pregnancy,1

the cystic mass was adhered to the ileum but there was no definite communication to the ileum the feeding arteries of the cyst were communicating branches from the upper mesentery artery and the lymph nodes around the cyst were slightly swollen figure ac at the small bowel follow through exam the cyst did not come out but it did exclude normal intestine figure b there were not significant findings during a colonoscopic examination
based on these findings we diagnosed the cyst as an ileal duplication and decided to perform surgery in order to prevent a recurrence of abdominal pain and lethal complications such as bleeding or perforation
we employed a four port laparoscope assisted resection of the duplicated ileum and segmental resection of the normal ileum an umbilical port was used for a mini laparotomy with a zigzag skin incision figure a the cyst’s stalk was attached to the base of the mesentery of the terminal ileum approximately 40 cm from the ileocecal junction figure bc after resection of the cyst a side to side anastomosis of the ileum was made with a stapler
the resected specimen showed an ileal duplication of 18 × 7 cm in diameter filled with purulent matter with some ulcers inside figure a the histological findings showed that it had a mucus gland inside like intestinal epithelium and was covered with two layers of smooth muscle there was no communication between the duplication and normal ileum but they had a common muscle layer figure bc

mri of the brain and orbits confirmed these findings showing diffuse enlargement of the optic tracts extending from the lateral geniculate nuclei to the optic chiasm and into the bilateral optic nerves with a mass demonstrating 270º encasement of the bilateral supraclinoid internal carotid arteries and near circumferential encasement of the bilateral a1 segments of the anterior cerebral arteries figures  
these imaging findings confirmed the suspicion of bilateral optic pathway glioma and as a result the patient was admitted to the hospital and evaluated by both neurosurgery and pediatric hematology oncology neurosurgery did not recommend any surgical intervention at the time and the hematology oncology team recommended proceeding with chemotherapy his genetic testing results showed no evidence of clinically significant variants of neurofibromatosis i or ii suggesting a sporadic bilateral optic pathway glioma the patient was then discharged and was followed up on an outpatient basis by both ophthalmology and pediatric hematology oncology for maintenance chemotherapy with carboplatin and vincristine",inclusion criteria an out of hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm glasgow coma scale gcs score less than or equal to 8 exclusion criteria patients with pre existent terminal renal insufficiency known glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency risk of hemolysis history of urolithiasis oxalate nephropathy or hemochromatosis treatment limitations,1

"a 43 year old caucasian female presented with multiple episodes of loose watery dark stools her presentation was associated with gradual onset colicky lower abdominal pain since the previous day she otherwise denied any fever nausea or vomiting history of ill contact or any history of travelling or taking outside food no one within her household had similar symptoms
the patient had been diagnosed several years earlier with multiple sclerosis ms and is wheel chair bound due to that disease she had been prescribed alemtuzumab in a clinical trial 10 years preceding this presentation and had used teriflunomide for one year prior to being prescribed ocrelizumab by her neurologist—she had received two doses six months apart she denied any prior history of inflammatory bowel disease or bowel cancer
upon examination it was noted that she was afebrile and was haemodynamically stable examination of the abdomen revealed a soft abdomen with tenderness at the suprapubic and iliac regions with increased bowel sounds but no evidence of peritonism or organomegaly digital per rectal examination established an empty rectum
the patient was ordered a range of initial laboratory and imaging investigations and follow up diagnostics based on those findings tables and  the abdominal x ray  demonstrated a classical thumbprinting sign that was nonspecific but suspicious for clostridium difficile infection empirical antibiotics iv metronidazole and oral vancomycin were commenced for presumed clostridium difficile infection while awaiting for laboratory tests and histology results
the patients venous blood gas showed lactate of 4 mmoll normal range 06–18 mmoll which prompted a ct abdomen the ct demonstrated a pronounced colitis extending from the transverse colon to the sigmoid colon when the patient did not respond to iv metronidazole and oral vancomycin a flexible sigmoidoscopy was undertaken and showed nodular mucosa with white yellowish adherent plaques with increasing severity from the rectosigmoid to the sigmoid figures and  the histology from biopsies taken from various parts of the left colon was negative for cytomegalovirus cmv and clostridium difficile infection but suggestive of biological medication effect
accordingly the patient was treated as ocrelizumab induced colitis and commenced on intravenous hydrocortisone her crp was downtrending on hydrocortisone however serial abdominal x rays demonstrated ongoing gaseous distension and she continued having watery bowel motions the patient was referred to a tertiary hospital and colorectal surgeons for medication resistant biological medication induced colitis she subsequently underwent a total colectomy and ileostomy formation",inclusion criteria patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 age 65 years or older to be under follow up in the same center for at least one year exclusion criteria younger than 65 years old having decompensated liver disease psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy,1

"an 18 year old female patient reported to our department with the complaint of poor esthetic appearance due to missing upper and lower front teeth since 4 years and seeking prosthetic treatment patient gave no history of trauma and extractions in relation with the missing teeth the patient reported that the teeth exfoliated due to loosening the patients medical history was not contributory family history revealed no such abnormality among other family members
on intraoral examination  the morphologic appearance and color of the permanent teeth were normal in maxillary arch the missing teeth were from right canine region to left canine region and in mandibular arch all the incisors were missing there was generalized grade ii and grade iii mobility oral hygiene was poor and there were plaque and calculus deposits in all the quadrants restorations were present in left maxillary first molar and mandibular second molar
panoramic radiograph  revealed adequate enamel thickness on the cuspal tips of all the teeth there was no root formation in most of the teeth while some of the teeth exhibited short blunted and malformed roots of only a few millimeters with obliterated pulp chambers the mandibular first left molar tooth had taurodontism like appearance well defined periapical radiolucencies were present in association with the apex of the mandibular left first molar and right first and second molar
although the patient had attained her physical maturity and was ready for definitive dental treatment but her physical financial and psychological situations were important to be considered in selecting the final treatment plan the following treatment plan was formulated for the patient dietary and oral hygiene instructions were given to the patient and extraction of the teeth that were mobile was advised along with the rehabilitation of the missing teeth with prosthesis
the right maxillary first molar tooth was extracted and sent to department of oral pathology and microbiology clinical examination of the gross specimen  revealed an intact tooth the tooth crown was of normal dimensions measuring around 75 mm but the roots were short and measured about 6 mm the specimen was sectioned mesiodistally into halves the mesiodistally cut tooth surface showed total obliteration of pulp chambers with dentin one half of the cut tooth specimen was decalcified in 10 nitric acid and processed for hematoxylin eosin h and e staining other half of the cut tooth specimen was used for preparing ground section
the ground section figure and  showed normal crown outline with normal enamel covering a thin layer of superficial mantle dentin appeared but the pulp chamber was totally obliterated by an unusual calcified material consisting of atypical tubular dentin and osteodentin covered by thin discontinuous layer of cementum normal dentinal tubule formation appeared to have been blocked and the new dentin so formed around obstacle gave rise to the characteristic appearance of “lava flow around the boulder” 
histopathologic examination of the decalcified hematoxylin eosin section  showed total obliteration of pulp that was filled with tubular dentin osteodentin and irregular globular masses of dentin figure and  a cluster of odontoblasts was seen within the globular masses of dentin

"a 45 year old male underwent a left upper lobectomy and postoperative pathology revealed invasive stage iiia lung adenocarcinoma  targeted next  generation sequencing ngs with a customized panel geneseeq prime panel designed to target 425 cancer specific genes was performed and four somatic mutations and copy number alterations cnas were identified including egfr kdd of exon 18 25 mutant allele frequency maf 135 egfr amplification 45 fold tp53 py220c maf 370 and rb1 single copy loss  the tumor mutation burden tmb was estimated to be 11 mutationmb the patient received pemetrexed and cisplatin as adjuvant chemotherapy four months later he progressed with liver metastasis in left lobe 
then the patient was treated with icotinib and the metastasis shrunk unfortunately the drug resistance was observed only after 4 months as evidenced by the fact that previously responsive liver lesion progressed left hepatic re biopsy confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma and target sequencing geneseeq prime panel detected the same egfr kdd maf 49 as well as mutation of tp53 py220c maf 05  the tmb was calculated as 22 mutationmb
docetaxel and cisplatin were initiated as the second line therapy however the left hepatic metastasis enlarged rapidly after 2 cycles of chemotherapy the blood carcinoembryonic antigen cea level increased from 95 mgml before chemotherapy to 227 mgml even worse a right hepatic metastasis appeared soon afterward radiofrequency ablation rfa of liver was conducted on both of the left and right hepatic metastases but no reduction in liver lesions was observed and the cea level showed a slight increase from 73 to 103 mgml
afterward the patient started taking osimertinib 80 mg once daily encouragingly both liver lesions showed significant regression  one month after initiation of osimertinib the cea level decreased to 54 mgml and remained at normal level for 18 months moreover the progression free survival pfs reached 21 months however the cea level increased to 231 mgml at the 19th month after the initiation of osimertinib treatment and 2 months later the patient progressed with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes  with the cea level of 739 mgml resampling and targeted sequencing geneseeq prime panel consistently identified egfr kdd maf 339 as well as egfr amplification 66 fold tp53 py220c maf 533 and a new mutation of reln pg1774e maf 454  the estimated tmb increased to 34 mutationmb in addition the assessment of pd l1 expression using antibody 28 8 pharm dx dako’s platform showed tumor proportion score tps of 1
on these bases the fourth line salvage therapy using nivolumab was prescribed and the therapeutic efficacy was considerable as evidenced by the decreased cea regressed mediastinal lymph nodes reduced metastases in both left and right liver  specifically the cea level decreased from 1436 to 418 mgml one month later the pfs reached 7 months and no obvious adverse effects were observed the quality of life was in good status during the nivolumab treatment after that the patient progressed with enlarged liver metastasis unfortunately the patient was also infected with tuberculosis and his condition took a sharp turn for the worse due to both tumor progression and tuberculosis the families gave up further treatment and the patient died 4 months later",inclusion criteria patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 age 65 years or older to be under follow up in the same center for at least one year exclusion criteria younger than 65 years old having decompensated liver disease psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy,1

although short stature was disproportionate diagnosis of ns was suspected and genetic tests of the ptpn11 gene were requested the entire coding regions and intron exon boundaries of the ptpn11 gene were amplificated by polymerase chain reaction using genomic dna and sequence specific primers both forward and reverse strands were directly sequenced using an automatic dna sequencer the results confirmed ns because a c922ag rs28933386 heterozygous mutation in exon 8 of the ptpn11 gene leading to a pasn308asp substitution was identified reference transcript ncbi nm0028343 and np0028253 this mutation has already been described as pathogenic by siegfried et al 
due to the presence of a mesomelic short stature the concurrent presence of two genetic mutations was considered and a genetic evaluation of the shox gene was requested a test of chromosomal microarray analysis performed with the cgh array led to the identification of a micro duplication at the level of the region par 1 xp2233yp1132 extended about 680 kb involving the shox gene the microduplication in the pseudoautosomal region par1 has already been described in ns and its clinical significance therefore appears to be certain

during routine dissection a markedly dilated left ureter was noticed and further explored  the left renal pelvis was located outside of the kidney sitting medially inferiorly and slightly posteriorly from the kidney the path of the ureter curved slightly posteriorly and medially before turning laterally the ureter then turned sharply medially and anteriorly before continuing over the psoas major muscle the ureter was most dilated as it passed anteriorly to the left psoas minor muscle where its diameter measured at 170 cm the ureter then passed posterior to the eia and anterior to the iia about 050 cm away from the bifurcation of the aa
upon further dissection it was found that what was initially identified as the left cia was in fact the left eia the donor had three terminal arterial branches off the aa the right cia left iia and left eia the left iia branched off the posterior side of the aa as a result the median sacral artery was shifted and was observed branching off the right cia  after passing beneath the left eia the left ureter returned to a normal size 045 cm and position following a normal path to the bladder 
the three major calyces of the left kidney were found to join together outside of the kidney  all arteries and veins of the left kidney were normal and no evidence of hydronephrosis was observed  constriction of the ureteropelvic junction upj was noted though this slight constriction did not result in any gross renal pathology 
finally the subject exhibited extensive surgical sutures likely from the hysterectomy along the lateral paravertebral muscles as well as near the left iia inferolateral to the ureter",inclusion criteria patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 age 65 years or older to be under follow up in the same center for at least one year exclusion criteria younger than 65 years old having decompensated liver disease psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy,1

"a 46 year old male with a past medical history of hypertension presented to our trauma bay with complex injuries of the right nose and midface which included an amputated nose upper lip and right eyebrow approximately 40 minutes after an assault including numerous human bite wounds his right ala right sidewall and right upper lip were entirely missing with nasal airways on each side visible the amputated specimens included nasal tissue which measured approximately 40 x 40 cm the eyebrow 20 x 20 cm and the upper lip 10 x 117 cm figure  after rapid sequence intubation assessment and stabilization the patient was taken to the operating room about one hour after the initial presentation for reattachment and wound reconstruction
in the or the superior labial artery and a small outflow vein which was likely part of the superior labial venous plexus were identified and isolated from the lateral portion of the lip however the nasal segment contained no identifiable viable artery or vein therefore the nasal and eyebrow portions were replanted similarly to full thickness skin grafts and the upper lip was replanted using microvascular techniques the segments of each vessel were flushed with heparinized saline then the superior labial artery was anastomosed using 9 0 nylon interrupted sutures followed by anastomosis of the vein using 9 0 nylon after three hours and 19 minutes of operating time arterial blood flow was immediately apparent but venous flow was not definitive the wounds of the upper eyelid and right cheek were debrided and then closed
to improve the chance of tissue survival our patient was scheduled to receive hyperbaric oxygen treatment within 24 hours post operation however the patient reported that his ears could not tolerate the pressure and therapy was postponed until otolaryngology could insert tubes at the bedside additionally he was receiving 30 mg of enoxaparin daily to mitigate the chance of outflow venous thrombosis the replaced nasal and eyebrow tissue and the microsurgically replanted upper lip appeared to have some minor ischemia at the lateral margins particularly of the nasal tip that would most likely require revision but the majority of the three portions appeared healthy figure 
later that day the patient reported upper extremity numbness after a non contrast ct showed no intracranial abnormality he received 834 mg bolus of tpa followed by 751 mg of iv tpa over the course of an hour for possible ischemic stroke subsequent mri showed a small acute left frontal cortical infarction the next morning the patient reported chest discomfort and an ekg showed st segment elevation of inferior leads with elevated troponin peak of 1322 due to myocardial infarction the patient then underwent left heart catheterization that showed adequate flow and no need for further intervention after these events he received 30 mg of enoxaparin twice a day per protocol
after tpa treatment there was marked continuous sanguineous discharge from the replant sites and the eyebrow nose and upper lip began to appear increasingly dusky our patient was determined to be a high risk candidate for immediate revision surgery and plans for secondary reconstruction were made the patient returned six days later for facial wound debridement of necrotic wounds of the upper lip nose and right forehead with subsequent placement of integra artificial dermis figure  he subsequently underwent nose and upper lip advancement flaps to save oral competence a month later nasal reconstruction was undertaken with a left paramedian forehead flap and full thickness skin graft to upper lip and nose the second stage of reconstruction was done one month later including the second stage of the paramedian flap ear cartilage graft to the nose and full thickness skin graft of the upper lip figure  subsequent reconstruction one month later included an abbe flap from the lower lip to the upper lip and final revision of the forehead flap overall our patient was satisfied with the cosmetic and functional outcome of his reconstruction four months after his final surgery figure",inclusion criteria age greater than or equal to 18 years sustained rosc within 60 minutes of arrest patient is comatose unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands after resuscitation exclusion criteria cerebral perfusion partially or fully dependant functional status prior to index cardiac event acute traumatic brain injury sah massive stroke or intracranial hemorrhage initiation of monitoring is not feasible for logistical reasons urgent surgery planned severe co morbidity or terminal illness which makes survival to 3 months unlikely pregnancy,1

"a 49 year old male presented with a history of bomb blast injury to his left elbow 25 years back when he had sustained an open and comminuted fracture of left distal humerus with extension into the elbow joint the injury was treated with wound debridement and cast application for 6 weeks distal humerus progressed to atrophic non union with severe deformity and stiffness of the elbow he also had partial involvement of radial and ulnar nerves with stiffness and deformities of the fingers of the left hand he presented to us for correction of the elbow deformity and to gain reasonable elbow and hand function
on local examination there were multiple scars present medially laterally and posteriorly around his left elbow suggestive of healed wounds by secondary intention after compound injury there was fixed flexion deformity of the elbow of 900 with further flexion up to 120 degree was possible   there was partial sensory loss in the little and ring fingers and the muscle power as per mrc grading of the finger flexors was 35 wrist and those of elbow flexors was 25 the motor power of left fingers wrist and elbow extensors were 15
plain radiographs revealed atrophic non union of the supracondylar fracture along with the deformity at the distal humerus due to malunited distal humeral fracture   ct scan confirmed these radiographic findings and demonstrated a significant gap at the fracture site with grossly rotated distal humeral condylar fragments and marked disuse osteopenia
in view of grossly distorted anatomy of the distal humerus poor bone stock bone gap at the non united fracture severe elbow deformity and stiffness we preferred to go for a mega prosthetic replacement of the left elbow under general anaesthesia elbow was approached posteriorly by ’wadsworth approach’ and the fracture site was exposed severe fibrosis was encountered between the fractured ends of the bone which was excised the distal humeral condylar fragments were found to be grossly mal positioned osteoporosed destructed and were not amenable to osteosynthesis or conventional total elbow replacement hence the distal humeral bone fragments were excised leading to a large bone gap at the elbow this gap was reconstructed by using elbow mega prosthesis preparation for mega prosthetic replacement was done by reaming the humeral and ulnar shafts cemented titanium prosthesis xlo tm was used for reconstruction with ulnar stem of 132 mm and humeral stem of 175 mm length the implant had eyes in the ulnar component for the attachment of the triceps tendon common flexor tendons were attached on the medial side and the common extensor tendons were attached on lateral side of triceps tendon and finally the combined tendinous complex was attached at the eye of the prosthesis with the help of non absorbable polyester suture ethibond™ no 5 intra operatively we could achieve good correction of the elbow deformity with rom of 10 1500 with stable elbow joint

a week after surgery she developed a perirectal abscess that had formed at the site of the sphincterotomy and was prescribed orally administered ciprofloxacin despite moderate symptom improvement in september 2015 she required an abscess incision and drainage procedure and penrose drain insertion prior to the surgery she was given a single dose of clindamycin an additional 2 week course of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole was then prescribed in late september 2015 she was admitted to the hospital for two nights due to further complications related to the abscess and was then diagnosed as having a perianal fistula
in november 2015 she was prescribed clindamycin for an episode of group c streptococcal positive pharyngitis in late november 2015 she was also diagnosed as having ehlers–danlos syndrome which according to her medical record may partially explain the poor wound healing from the perirectal abscess in december 2015 her fistula required an anus seton placement she was treated with multiple courses of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole off and on from december 2015 to january 2016

she continued to complain of persistent dyspnea on exertion and thus was referred to our institution for a repeat of tte at the outpatient cardiac diagnostic center tte revealed the rare presystolic flow through pulmonic valve excessive variation in the mitral valve and aortic valve spectral doppler velocities and markedly thickened pericardium figures – consistent with constriction  the study also demonstrated septal bounce small pericardial effusion and pleural effusion the patient was admitted for further evaluation on admission the patients vital signs showed a temperature of 37 degrees celsius a blood pressure of 10870 a heart rate of 117 and respiratory rate of 20 with an oxygen saturation of 99 in room air her exam revealed a young woman in mild distress with 11 cm internal jugular vein distension decreased breath sounds at lung bases bilaterally and scant bibasilar crackles regular tachycardia and bilateral lower extremity edema her bnp was 124 crp was 51 and wbc count was 59 with a normal differential her complete metabolic panel was unremarkable the patient underwent a left and right heart catheterization due to the suspicion of constrictive pericarditis a coronary angiogram demonstrated no obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease the right heart catheterization revealed elevated right atrial pressure right ventricular end diastolic pressure and an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure simultaneous right and left ventricular pressure tracings demonstrated discordant respiratory variation consistent with constrictive pericarditis a computed tomography ct scan of her chest with contrast confirmed marked thickening of both the parietal and pleural pericardial surfaces measuring up to 134 mm in thickness and a large right sided pleural effusion figures and  cardiac magnetic resonance imaging mri with and without contrast showed diffuse pericardial thickening  which showed intense delayed gadolinium contrast enhancement  that did not involve the myocardium additionally there was a greater interventricular septal bounce during diastole and inspiration consistent with chronic inflammatory constrictive pericarditis
due to her worsening symptoms and diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis she was referred to cardiothoracic surgery at our institution for pericardiectomy the surgery was without incident and the surgical samples were sent for pathology while being negative for afb by concentrated smear and culture the stripped pericardium showed noncaseating granulomas extensive fibrosis and severe lymphohistiocytic infiltrate
in the immediate postoperative period the patient began to develop signs and symptoms of central volume overload heart failure and hypotension an electrocardiogram ecg at this time showed sinus tachycardia with nonspecific st t abnormalities with poor r wave progression new from prior ecgs a subsequent tte on postoperative day one showed significant changes from the prior study with severely decreased biventricular dysfunction the lvef was severely depressed at 26 with early evidence of elevated filling pressure within the left ventricle indicated by the time difference between pulmonary vein ar duration and mitral a wave duration ar a of positive 46 ms for the right ventricle fractional area change fac was abnormally low at 29 with reduced tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion tapse distance of 096 cm there was also moderate tricuspid regurgitation enlarged right atrium area 27 cm2 and moderately elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 41 mmhg there was akinesis of the entire apical and midventricular segments of both the right and left ventricles figures – with hypercontractile base findings were consistent with stress cardiomyopathy
while in critical condition postoperatively the patient had episodes of atrial fibrillation and atrial tachycardia for which she was chemically cardioverted with intravenous amiodarone with subsequent conversion to sinus rhythm initially the patient required multiple vasopressors and inotropes epinephrine norepinephrine milrinone and dopamine drip to maintain her blood pressure and cardiac output while gentle diuresis was achieved carefully for the symptoms of heart failure once the patient was hemodynamically stable she was placed on appropriate oral medical therapy including carvedilol and furosemide followed by gradual clinical improvement and was able to be discharged on postoperative day 10 due to decreased urine output and hypotension an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker was not initiated at the time a posthospital tte 7 weeks after discharge showed normalized function of both the right and left ventricles figures –",inclusion criteria an out of hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm glasgow coma scale gcs score less than or equal to 8 exclusion criteria patients with pre existent terminal renal insufficiency known glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency risk of hemolysis history of urolithiasis oxalate nephropathy or hemochromatosis treatment limitations,1

"a 29 year old female in her second pregnancy with a history of tetralogy of fallot or ventricular septal defect with pulmonary atresia had undergone 4 surgeries during her childhood including a modified blalock taussig shunt patch repair of ventricular septal defect and a right ventricle rv to pulmonary artery pa conduit at 20 weeks’ gestation during her first pregnancy she developed severe symptomatic stenosis of the rv to pa conduit with a doppler gradient of 98 mmhg thus requiring a 22 mm balloon dilatation and genesis xd stent as a temporizing measure until definitive repair could be undertaken postpartum however she was lost to follow up after delivery of her first child and did not undergo postpartum repair of her rv to pa conduit stenosis
the patient presented to our clinic during her second pregnancy at 21 weeks of gestation thus far her pregnancy had been uncomplicated and prenatal testing to date had found no abnormalities in fetal development on presentation she admitted to mild dyspnea on exertion at a distance of 20 yards on examination the patient was tachycardic and normotensive with normal oxygenation she was euvolemic with hemoglobin of 135 gdl and creatinine of 07 mgdl echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction lvef of 60 to 65 with mild right atrial ra dilatation evidence of rv hypertrophy and an estimated rv pressure of 82 mmhg the pa conduit was severely stenosed with a mean gradient of 52 mmhg and unrestricted pulmonic valve insufficiency our assessment determined her modified world health organization who pregnancy risk classification to be ii iii moderately increased risk of maternal mortality and moderate morbidity
she was seen again in clinic at 34 weeks’ gestation her symptoms and repeat echocardiogram were unchanged from the previous visit however at 365 weeks’ gestation 2 dimensional echocardiogram done in preparation for delivery identified severe conduit stenosis with a mean gradient of 75 mmhg peak gradient of 98 mmhg with a peak velocity of 5 ms and unrestricted pulmonic valve insufficiency the patients rv pressures at the time also exceeded 71 mmhg despite the severe restenosis and unrestricted insufficiency of her pa conduit her symptoms remained new york heart association nyha class ii the plan was to admit the patient prior to cesarean section for assessment of heart failure and bilateral tubal ligation at 37 weeks’ gestation
as planned she was admitted at 37 weeks for delivery and was cared for by a multidisciplinary team involving obstetrics achd specialists heart failure specialists obstetric anesthesia maternal fetal medicine and the neonatal intensive care unit
the patient underwent a successful low transverse cesarean section and bilateral tubal ligation under epidural block with an estimated blood loss of 1100 ml postdelivery echocardiogram showed normal lvef of 55 to 60 ra and rv dilatation with rv hypertrophy and no change in rv pressure or valve gradient the rv to pa conduit stenosis had decreased to a peak velocity of 48 ms and a mean gradient of 56 mmhg with unrestricted insufficiency
the patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course only requiring some gentle hydration and was discharged 3 days postpartum she was scheduled for follow up for severe conduit stenosis at 6 weeks postpartum to discuss management options",inclusion criteria age greater than or equal to 18 years sustained rosc within 60 minutes of arrest patient is comatose unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands after resuscitation exclusion criteria cerebral perfusion partially or fully dependant functional status prior to index cardiac event acute traumatic brain injury sah massive stroke or intracranial hemorrhage initiation of monitoring is not feasible for logistical reasons urgent surgery planned severe co morbidity or terminal illness which makes survival to 3 months unlikely pregnancy,1
