"a 55 year old boy visited the endocrinological section of the pediatric unit of the general hospital of terni italy due to short stature his mothers height was 170 cm and his fathers height was 172 cm target height 1775 cm  50° centile in his family history there was paternal familiarity for psychotic crises in his adolescence and mother with thrombophilia and history of five pregnancies with three spontaneous abortions and two parts the mother took cardioaspirine during the pregnancy no genetic disease was reported in his family the child was born at term via spontaneous vaginal delivery the birth weight was 3050 gr 10° 25° centile and the birth length was 45 cm below the third centile a villocentesis performed at week 12 of gestation due to an alteration in nuchal translucency on obstetric ultrasound did not reveal any abnormality 46 xy after birth a small ventricular septal defect and mild bilateral pyelectasis were detected but within 6 months both of these abnormalities spontaneously disappeared bilateral orchiopexy was performed at 19 months of age for undescended testicles regarding linear growth auxological data recorded by the primary care pediatrician revealed short stature that was 2 standard deviation sd below the 3° centile on the italian cross sectional growth charts for height  since the first months of life in the last 2 years the child has exhibited an even more exacerbated decline in his growth curve before entering the hospital first level laboratory tests for the evaluation of short stature ie full blood count inflammatory markers renal function hepatic function coeliac screening and thyroid function tests had been already performed no abnormal results were evidenced the bone age was delayed by 2 years
in the hospital his height was 992 cm 3 sd his weight was 155 kg 3° centile and his growth velocity was 4 cmyear 3° centile his arm span was of 94 cm and his sitting height was of 55 cm height ratio was 95 his sitting height height ratio was therefore 56 slightly over the upper normal limit of 555 and his body mass index was below the 50th centile pathological rappold index 8 furthermore he presented with unusual facial features that included hypertelorism low set ears a low posterior hairline down slanting palpebral fissures pectus excavatum and ogival palate figure 
however madelung deformity was not suggested by clinical examination and not detected by wrist x ray findings radiological and laboratory tests to rule out related renal cardiac ophthalmologic and audiological abnormalities did not find any significant alterations at an evaluation conducted by an infant neuropsychiatrist the patient exhibited a mild cognitive impairment compared with the standard for his age that included a prevalent verbal difficulty compatible with the diagnosis of ns eeg and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging results were normal the peak growth hormone gh value in a clonidine stimulation test was in the normal range 127 mgl the igf 1 level was 47 ngml normal values for age 32–259 ngml
although short stature was disproportionate diagnosis of ns was suspected and genetic tests of the ptpn11 gene were requested the entire coding regions and intron exon boundaries of the ptpn11 gene were amplificated by polymerase chain reaction using genomic dna and sequence specific primers both forward and reverse strands were directly sequenced using an automatic dna sequencer the results confirmed ns because a c922ag rs28933386 heterozygous mutation in exon 8 of the ptpn11 gene leading to a pasn308asp substitution was identified reference transcript ncbi nm0028343 and np0028253 this mutation has already been described as pathogenic by siegfried et al 
due to the presence of a mesomelic short stature the concurrent presence of two genetic mutations was considered and a genetic evaluation of the shox gene was requested a test of chromosomal microarray analysis performed with the cgh array led to the identification of a micro duplication at the level of the region par 1 xp2233yp1132 extended about 680 kb involving the shox gene the microduplication in the pseudoautosomal region par1 has already been described in ns and its clinical significance therefore appears to be certain

"a 58 year old male patient presented with a rapidly growing mass at the right posterior chest wall for one month initially the patient had found an egg sized lump at his right posterior chest wall the patient received acupuncture at an oriental medicine clinic 10 days before admission the soft mass showed relative hardening and rapid growth after the acupuncture
in the physical examination an approximately 5 cm mass was palpable at the right posterior lateral chest wall around the inferior angle of the scapula the mass was mild and tender without heat or redness the patient had no history of trauma and had played golf excessively for the last six months
chest radiograph showed no bony abnormality or lung infiltration chest computed tomography showed a heterogeneous cystic mass on the right chest wall a magnetic resonance axial t1 weighted image showed a well demarcated lenticular mass lesion located in the right subscapular region between the serratus anterior muscle and the thoracic rib cage 
we first recommended sonographically guided aspiration however the patient refused to undergo this procedure because of the possibility of recurrence after aspiration and rapid growth of mass excision of the mass was performed under general anesthesia the patient was placed in a left lateral decubitus position the latissimus dorsi and serratus anterior muscle were dissected after an incision was made over the right subscapular area a soft movable scapulothoracic mass which was loosely attached between the serratus anterior and the intercostal muscle was observed
a well encapsulated cystic mass measuring 8×5×5 cm in size was excised a hemorrhage occurred which was suspected to be a result of acupuncture in an oriental medicine clinic  a histopathologic examination showed a pseudocyst with a thickened fibrotic wall which was filled with blood clots many lymphocyte proliferations were observed in the cystic wall without neoplastic cells

the further development in hb and iga levels is shown in  during the next couple of years hb ranged from 90 to 100 gdl she had only mild fatigue and no transfusion requirement management consisted of regular follow up avoidance of cold exposure and prompt antibiotic therapy in case of febrile bacterial infection but no cad directed pharmacological therapy by 2014 a second bone marrow biopsy showed erythroid hyperplasia and lymphoid infiltrates now interpreted as probable cad associated lpd  flow cytometry in bone marrow aspirate again demonstrated 2 pathological clones of κ positive b lymphocytes approximately 5 and λ positive plasma cells 07 respectively
her condition remained stable until late spring 2016 when she deteriorated her fatigue worsened her atrial fibrillation relapsed more frequently and her hb level declined to 85 gdl the reticulocyte count was now elevated at 191 × 109l ldh was 303 ul bilirubin 96 μmoll haptoglobin 01 gl while iga had increased to 125 gl and ca titer to 512 the dat findings were unchanged we decided to give her rituximab monotherapy  four weekly doses of 375 mgm2 which she received from august 2016 hb rose to 125 gdl by december 2016 while bilirubin and ldh normalized unexpectedly however her iga level continued to increase from 125 gl immediately before rituximab treatment to 196 gl by january 2017
from june 2017 hb started again to decline and iga continued to increase in january 2018 she experienced severe lumbar pain after having removed snow from her courtyard which can be heavy work in norway one month later hb was 95 gdl while the absolute reticulocyte count was 153 × 109l and the levels of ldh bilirubin and haptoglobin had not changed significantly the iga level was 245 gl and β2 microglobulin 35 mgl a new trephine biopsy showed hypercellular bone marrow affected by 20 infiltration of monoclonal λ positive plasma cells and some small lymphocytic infiltrates a ct scan showed osteolytic lesions of the skull but no relevant pathological findings in her spine pelvis or femora she was diagnosed with development of mm
in february 2018 a local visiting hematologist initiated a cycle of melphalan and prednisolone during the next couple of weeks hb declined further to 80 gdl however without any neutropenia or thrombocytopenia concomitantly a rise in bilirubin and ldh was observed and she was diagnosed with an exacerbation of cad melphalan and prednisolone were discontinued after the first cycle
hoping to induce remission of both mm and cad we decided in march 2018 to offer her bortezomib based therapy  with the addition of dexamethasone and rituximab    she received four cycles at four weeks interval of bortezomib 13 mgm2 weekly for 3 weeks rituximab 375 mgm2 once per treatment cycle and dexamethasone 20 mg on days 1 2 8 9 15 and 16 she tolerated this combination well her hb level increased from 80 gdl to 136 gdl following the first cycle and reached 144 gdl after the second one bilirubin and ldh normalized within a couple of weeks and reticulocyte count declined to the normal range 65 × 109l iga had declined to 38 gl by the start of the second cycle her back pain improved ten weeks after start of therapy hb was 132 gl bilirubin 7 μmoll ldh 247 ul haptoglobin 024 gl and ca titer 64 iga remained in plateau at 39 gl while serum electrophoresis did not show any monoclonal spike dat was still positive for c3d
the lymphoma pathologist in our group ur did a centralized parallel review of all three bone marrow samples based on extensive experience with cad associated bone marrow pathology  the 2012 biopsy shows in addition to erythroid hyperplasia intraparenchymatous κ positive b cell infiltrates consistent with cad associated lpd there are scattered κ positive plasma cells more of them near the lymphocytic infiltrates and one distinct infiltrate of λ positive plasma cells in the 2014 biopsy the picture has not changed significantly the trephine biopsy from february 2018 shows an igaλ positive plasma cell population that has expanded but igmκ positive b cell infiltrates can still be seen in retrospect therefore all three biopsies show two clones and in the 2018 sample the cad associated igmκ plasma cell population seems “hidden” among the expanding myeloma associated igaλ plasma cells",inclusion criteria patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 age 65 years or older to be under follow up in the same center for at least one year exclusion criteria younger than 65 years old having decompensated liver disease psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy,0.5

"sarah was 8 months old when she first came to our clinical unit with her family sarah had a severe visual impairment moreover sarah’s mother reported that she faced many challenges in trying to understand her daughter and interacting with her in a reciprocal satisfying way the visual impairment of the infant was a great barrier for the mother who reported feelings of sadness and inadequacy as a caregiver
to support the mother in detecting communicative intent and participation in sarah’s behavior during the interaction and to increase the opportunity for the dyad to perceive more pleasure in their relationship
we videotaped the ffsf paradigm with sarah and her mother during the play episode sarah demonstrated to be able to orient her attention to auditory stimuli eg maternal voice but the mother rarely interpreted and responded properly to her orientation as communicative signals the mother was frequently silent producing few attempts to engage with sarah and remaining physically distant the mother used the pacifier any time sarah displayed minimal distress the interaction appeared to be very difficult and – according to maternal reports – not very satisfying during the still face episode sarah stood relatively quiet with very few movements of the arms and legs nonetheless a few seconds after the still face episode onset she started to protrude in the direction of the mother producing a lot more vocalizations compared to the play episode and showing increased distress and negative emotionality as soon as the reunion episode started the mother resumed to interact with sarah and said “oh you’re here then” during the reunion phase the mother appeared more active in the interaction with her daughter and after a period of negativity ie 3040 s sarah displayed a smile toward her mother
during the consultation the sarah’s mother immediately said that she had never seen sarah being so communicative and that the observation procedure “literally opened a new window in our relationship” looking at sarah’s response to the still face episode further allowed the mother and the psychologist to identify specific communicative behaviors which were previously undetected by the mother eg active requests of being picked up attentional focus on the mother and sensitivity to maternal lack of communications moreover the mother acknowledged that sarah was indeed interested in interacting with her even in the presence of visual impairment this increased acknowledgment of sarah’s availability and desire to interact and was also an opportunity to set up a collaborative consultation on specific modalities to reach out to sara and to achieve better emotional closeness and reciprocal satisfaction
this clinical vignette suggests that the joint observation of ffsf promote in the sarah’s mother some changes in mental representation of her own infant in turn it reflects on subtle modifications in the maternal interactive style during interaction with sarah",inclusion criteria patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus patients 18 years of age or older patients admitted under medical or surgical services patients treated with diet alone insulin sq insulin pump or oral hypoglycemic medications have their own continuous glucose monitoring cgm monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission exclusion criteria individuals under 18 years of age covid 19 infection infection of the skin at the cgm site requiring removal of the sensor patients with altered mental status patients unable to scan their flash cgms at least every 8 hours inability to provide written consent hospitalized for less than 24 hours,0.5

"a 72 year old female patient with a symptomatic carotid stenosis previously identified by ultrasonography has come to our attention to perform a ct angiography of the neck vessels ct angiography examination showed the presence of a severe degree of carotid stenosis equal to about 85 calculated with the north american symptomatic carotid endarterectomy trial method therefore the patient was candidate to perform a carotid endarterectomy cea
however the ct angiography has identified some significant incidental findings that have profoundly changed the patient management
ct angiography identified an oval soft tissue mass well circumscribed with regular margins with size of 34 mm × 28 mm × 23 mm localized at the base of the tongue along the midline with avid and inhomogeneous enhancement this mass changed the aspect of the base of the tongue showing a major bulging on the lumen of the oropharynx with a significant reduction of the caliber of the air column more inferiorly just above the geniohyoid muscle on the midline and in proximity to the hyoid bone we detected another oval soft tissue mass with the same characteristics previously described and a size of 12 mm × 22 mm × 22 mm finally ct angiography revealed the absence of thyroid tissue in its normal position 
the knowledge of the embryologic thyroid course the absence of thyroid gland in its normal position the location of the two masses along the midline and their appearance on ct scans suggest a dual ectopic thyroid a lingual thyroid in the base of the tongue and suprahyoid thyroid just above the geniohyoid muscle on the midline in close proximity to the hyoid bone respectively
the ultrasound evaluation of the sublingual mass performed by a linear array transducer 10–15 mhz documented the typical ultrasound characteristics of the thyroid tissue 
the patient was then evaluated by otorhinolaryngology and the diagnosis of lingual thyroid was clinically confirmed thyroid function tests were found in the normal range
this patient was originally scheduled for cea which is effective in preventing ipsilateral ischemic events in patients with symptomatic moderate and high grade stenosis the radiological detection and subsequently clinical confirmation of lingual thyroid addressed the patient to an endovascular procedure by carotid angioplasty and stenting this alternative approach was chosen to minimize the risks of an endotracheal intubation such as hemorrhage and compromised airway in particular the large blood vessels on the surface of the lingual thyroid could be traumatized by the insertion of any instruments during intubation with potential onset of hemorrhage and compromised airway",inclusion criteria age greater than or equal to 18 years sustained rosc within 60 minutes of arrest patient is comatose unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands after resuscitation exclusion criteria cerebral perfusion partially or fully dependant functional status prior to index cardiac event acute traumatic brain injury sah massive stroke or intracranial hemorrhage initiation of monitoring is not feasible for logistical reasons urgent surgery planned severe co morbidity or terminal illness which makes survival to 3 months unlikely pregnancy,0.5

"this patient a five year old african american female fell at school and developed severe left knee pain three days after falling the patients mother contacted her primary care physician where she reported her daughters severe left knee pain that prevented her from walking and had worsened since the initial injury at this point the patients left knee was also warm and erythematous she and her daughter were referred to her local emergency department where radiographs of the patients left knee were conducted and were read as unremarkable with no signs of trauma  the patient was therefore diagnosed with a left knee sprain and was treated conservatively with pain control ice and nsaids and nwb without further intervention
eleven days later the patient was seen by her primary care physician for her persistent limp and intermittent pain although her swelling had resolved anteroposterior view of the pelvis and bilateral frog lateral radiographs were ordered to rule out any hip pathologies which could also cause an antalgic gait all films were read by an attending radiologist and were deemed unremarkable relying on these reads the primary care physician recommended the patient to continue supportive care nsaids and ice for pain nonweight bearing for left lower extremity and to refer to an orthopedist if symptoms persisted
despite these treatments the patients pain and limp persisted and the patient then sought a referral to a general pediatric orthopedist for further work up although the childs pain had slightly improved her limp remained she described her left knee pain as worse at night but responsive to acetaminophen and ice she had never felt anything like this before prior to her initial fall both the patient and her mother denied fever weight loss fatigue malaise or recent infection on physical exam her left knee did not have a palpable mass muscle atrophy or edema but was tender to palpation given concern for the persistent pain and antalgic gait repeat radiographs of the left knee were also ordered by the orthopedist and showed aggressive poorly defined lytic lesion centered within the left distal femur metadiaphysis extending up proximally 6 cm superiorly from the metaphysis with associated interrupted superior periosteal involvement  a radiologist reviewed these findings and agreed with the orthopedist that based on these radiographic findings there was concern for a primary bone malignancy arthrocentesis of the left knee was performed to rule out a possible infectious etiology which was negative acute phase reactants including c reactive protein sedimentation rate and leukocyte count were all within normal limits magnetic resonance imaging mri and needle biopsy were ordered to establish diagnosis contrast enhanced mri examination showed a enhancing mass centered in the distal femoral metaphysis approximately 7 cm in craniocaudal dimension with aggressive periosteal involvement  needle biopsy of the left distal femur was performed at the site of the lesion and pathology demonstrated cores of tumor tissue consisting of pleomorphic tumor cells with frequent mitoses foci of necrosis regions of chondroblastic differentiation and rare small foci of malignant osteoid production consistent with the diagnosis of osteosarcoma additional imaging including chest computerized tomography ct and whole body positron emission tomography pet was obtained for tumor staging and demonstrated no evidence of distant metastases
the patient was then referred to an orthopedic surgeon to discuss treatment options including oncologic and operative interventions given the concern for pathological fracture and possible subsequent contamination of healthy tissue from this tumor the patient was placed in a knee immobilizer to limit weight bearing nwb lle with walker the patient and her parents were referred to an oncologist to determine a chemotherapy plan a typical treatment plan of osteosarcoma involves surgical resection and six cycles of chemotherapy two cycles preoperatively as neoadjuvant therapy and four cycles postoperatively with high dose methotrexate doxorubicindexrazoxane and cisplatin
operative treatments were discussed between the family and the attending orthopaedic surgeon in great detail including potential risks and benefits and the family chose to proceed with van nes rotationplasty radical resection of the left distal femur 17 cm from the joint line with femurtibia osteoplasty with internal fixation and van nes rotationplasty of the left lower extremity and left sciatic neuroplasty was performed the procedure lasted around eight hours long without complications estimated blood loss was 100 ml or less the patient was transferred to the picu for monitoring postoperatively there were no wound complications postoperatively and the patient received trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and cefepime for antibiotic prophylaxis nine days later the patient was discharged with referrals to physical therapy and the appropriative postoperative wound care instructions

given the patient’s history and the morphology of the lesion an infectious process was initially suspected a set of blood cultures was obtained and serological tests including entamoeba histolyticaantibody serum ridascreen entamoeba histolytica igg r biopharm ag darmstadt germany echinococcus antibody igg serum ridascreen echinococcus igg r biopharm ag darmstadt germany and fungal antibodies by immunodiffusion were sent to mayo medical laboratories initial complete blood count and blood chemistry results revealed elevated leukocytes 16200mm3 thrombocytes 536000mm3 bilirubin 21 mgdl lactate dehydrogenase 531 iul gamma glyamyltransferase 119 ul and alkaline phosphatase 268 ul with normal liver transaminases and alpha fetoprotein afp due to suspicion of a pyogenic or amoebic liver abscess the patient was started on ceftriaxone and metronidazole
a ct guided needle biopsy of the liver mass taken the next day was positive for malignant cells by hematoxylin and eosin staining however surrounding fluid was negative for infectious agent by culture a second set of blood cultures continued to show no growth and antibiotics were discontinued subsequent laparoscopic liver biopsy figure  led to the diagnosis of undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma but was negative for any infectious agent the pathology report indicated markedly pleomorphic cells with brisk mitotic activity with no differentiation and areas of hemorrhage and necrosis immunohistochemical staining was positive for alpha i antitrypsin vimentin and desmin weakly positive for oscar focal pancytokeratin and negative for actin and hepatocyte specific antigen together this was most consistent with embryonal sarcoma the presence of lung nodules suggested stage iv metastatic disease however these were not biopsied
the elisa serological results for infectious diseases completed after the malignancy was confirmed by biopsy were positive for antibodies against echinococcosis and entamoeba histolytica and the fungal antibody panel was positive for histoplasma subsequent specific testing for histoplasma antibody via complement fixation and immunodiffusion was negative these confounding positive antibody results were thought to be a false positive due to a cross reaction with the patient’s hepatic mass as all cultures taken throughout including blood needle biopsy and wedge biopsy were negative
the patient received four cycles of chemotherapy consisting of ifosfamide and doxorubicin followed by surgical resection of the residual tumor four months after his initial diagnosis the patient underwent right hepatic trisegmentectomy along with resection of the right hemidiaphragm and mesh reconstruction a magnetic resonance imaging scan 10 months after his initial admission revealed no evidence of disease as did a follow up ct scan of the chest taken 13 months after admission",inclusion criteria an out of hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm glasgow coma scale gcs score less than or equal to 8 exclusion criteria patients with pre existent terminal renal insufficiency known glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency risk of hemolysis history of urolithiasis oxalate nephropathy or hemochromatosis treatment limitations,0.5
"the patient was a 45 year old man who presented with a headache for 3 months which was progressive and had been intolerable for 2 weeks however the patient was a football player with good health there was no such family history and family members were perfectly well there were no other clinical symptoms reported by the patient
the patient was advised to do ct scan and mri interestingly both ct scan and mri revealed brilliantly enhancing left lateral ventricular lesion with unilateral hydrocephalus  t1 image axial view postcontrast  and precontrast film  were also examined t1 image of coronal view in postcontrast film was also evaluated  t2 image in sagittal view  also found the sol
flare image  was examined as well all other investigations were within normal limit then the patient was advised for surgery for removal of the lesion in this context left parietal craniotomy was performed with total removal of the lesion through intraparietal approach reversal from ga and the postoperative period was uneventful and the patient had got rid of clinical symptom completely after surgery
the tumor was well defined preoperatively and was removed under microscopic surgery meticulously the patient was very poor to bear the cost of postoperative ct scan and hence it was not done the biopsy was sent for histopathological examination the lesion was nearly spherical measuring 30 cm  25 cm whitish and firm
there was no evidence of necrosis microscopy revealed multicystic appearance with cyst lined by columnar epithelium with apical mucin few goblet cells were seen few areas had shown pseudostratified lining epithelium with nuclear hyperchromasia nuclear enlargement and increased mitosis
there was no evidence of stromal invasion the mucinous material was seen within the lumen hemosiderin laden macrophages were present in the stroma it was confirmed as a lateral ventricular enterogenous cyst then the patient was well in around one year after about one year of the surgical removal of the lesion there was a recurrence of a headache whose intensity was more than the previous one
then the patient was advised to do a ct scan which revealed lesion of the same pattern in the same location as before  the patient was reexplored surgically and the tumor was removed completely through the same route and histopathology was again revealed it as a case of the enterogenous cyst again the total removal of the lesion from the brain was confirmed by postoperative ct scan then the patient was advised for radiotherapy after completion of radiotherapy the patient was perfectly well at 13th postoperative month",inclusion criteria patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 age 65 years or older to be under follow up in the same center for at least one year exclusion criteria younger than 65 years old having decompensated liver disease psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy,0.5
"in 2004 a 66 year old man was diagnosed with a papillary grade 2 nonmetastatic right renal cancer and was treated with radical right nephrectomy a nonspecific 10 mm diameter tumor was detected on his left kidney and hence he was placed under close surveillance in 2005 a partial left nephrectomy was performed but no pathological signs of malignancy could be evidenced in 2006 the patient was diagnosed with a prostatic adenocarcinoma and hence a radical prostatectomy was performed without any complication a few months later multiple suspect left renal lesions were identified and a left radical nephrectomy was recommended by the multidisciplinary urologic board after meeting pathological analyses revealed a papillary renal cancer the patient underwent hemodialysis 3 days a week monday wednesday and friday after bilateral complete nephrectomy and was closely monitored hemodialysis was performed between 2007 and 2010 without any complications in 2010 a 70 mm local recurrence was diagnosed in the left renal fossa bed biopsies were performed evidencing a recurrence of the papillary renal cancer since complete resection was impossible and in agreement with patient’s nephrologists sunitinib was initiated in august 2010 for the first cycle the smallest recommended dose of sunitinib was administered ie 375 mgday sunitinib cycles consisted of 28 days on and 14 days off treatment all along sunitinib administration blood pressure was monitored weekly he was considered to be stable and did not require treatment initiation
grade 3 vomiting occurred during all hemodialysis sessions performed following the first sunitinib initiation anticipatory nauseavomiting was not suspected since the patient was not reported to be anxious and anxiolytic treatments did not decrease the symptoms however the 14 days treatment break was associated with a complete resolution of nausea and a related to sunitinib side effect was suspected
ondansetron was prescribed during the whole second cycle of sunitinib but grade 1–2 vomiting during hemodialysis sessions was still reported digestive symptoms ceased again during the sunitinib off period
because of a grade 2 thrombocytopenia the third cycle was delayed and the sunitinib dose was reduced to 25 mgday despite the dose reduction and ondansetron systematic administration grade 1 vomiting under hemodialysis was systematic during the sunitinib administration vomiting only stopped after sunitinib was replaced with another tt because of disease progression after three sunitinib cycles",inclusion criteria age greater than or equal to 18 years sustained rosc within 60 minutes of arrest patient is comatose unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands after resuscitation exclusion criteria cerebral perfusion partially or fully dependant functional status prior to index cardiac event acute traumatic brain injury sah massive stroke or intracranial hemorrhage initiation of monitoring is not feasible for logistical reasons urgent surgery planned severe co morbidity or terminal illness which makes survival to 3 months unlikely pregnancy,0.5

the patient re presented to the emergency department 3 weeks after discharge with central abdominal pain anorexia and vomiting he had been experiencing these symptoms since day 3 of discharge and they had been getting worse until the time he re presented in spite of these symptoms he was systemically well examination of the abdomen revealed minimally distended abdomen with tenderness in the periumbilical region these symptoms and signs suggested that he had small bowel obstruction however in the setting of recent cholecystectomy we wanted to rule out the possibility of a biliary injury his lfts and inflammatory markers were normal his symptoms were further evaluated with a ct scan which showed evidence of sbo with transition point in the right iliac fossa the obstruction was from a laminated calcified structure applying extrinsic compression on a loop of small bowel with the knowledge of the index operation and the pathology report of the retrieved specimen it was suspected that this structure was the unretrieved gallstone this calculus was associated with a surrounding phlegmon evidenced by intense inflammatory change on the ct scan 
the patient underwent laparoscopy in view of the ct scan findings laparoscopy identified a large phlegmon compressing on the distal ileum causing obstruction with distended proximal and collapsed distal small bowel loops  dissection of the phlegmon revealed a small abscess cavity and the unretrieved gallstone at its center  the abscess was drained and the gallstone retrieved  which resulted in a resolution of the small bowel obstruction the patient made a gradual recovery and was subsequently discharged on postoperative day 4 at which point he was tolerating solid diet with return of normal gastrointestinal function",inclusion criteria age greater than or equal to 18 years sustained rosc within 60 minutes of arrest patient is comatose unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands after resuscitation exclusion criteria cerebral perfusion partially or fully dependant functional status prior to index cardiac event acute traumatic brain injury sah massive stroke or intracranial hemorrhage initiation of monitoring is not feasible for logistical reasons urgent surgery planned severe co morbidity or terminal illness which makes survival to 3 months unlikely pregnancy,0.5

a new ct guided biopsy was attempted and showed atypical cells consistent with an underlying malignant lesion a the thoracocentesis revealed an exudative and hemorrhagic pleural effusion without malignant cells
meanwhile the patient’s clinical condition deteriorated he became tachypneic and developed puffiness of the face and altered sensorium and a clinical diagnosis of superior vena cava obstruction was made he was kept on an antibiotic regimen with piperacillin tazobactam corticosteroids and controlled ventilation bedside 2d echocardiogram failed to evidence a pericardial tamponade but the mass was seen compressing the right atrium and superior vena cava on the eighth day of hospitalization his general condition suddenly worsened and he expired immediately the autopsy was performed with the working diagnosis of a right lung mass with svc syndrome probably due to malignant mesothelioma or a high grade sarcoma
external examination revealed proptosis of eyes and midline shift of trachea to the left on the opening of the chest cavity the right hemithorax was replaced by a massive hemorrhagic and necrotic tumor mass which was adherent to the chest wall in comparison on the left side there were 25 ml of straw colored pleural fluid noted with pleural sheen a the right lung weighed 1200 g rr 360 570 g and left lung weighed 550 g rr 325 480 g the right lung was replaced by a large tumor which was chiefly necrotic hemorrhagic and pulpy only a portion of the posterior segment of the middle lobe was noted to be intact the tumor mass pushed the trachea to the left the left lung was boggy and was oozing frothy blood stained fluid the cut section did not show any cavities abscesses or tumor deposits b
the liver was enlarged and weighed 1800 g rr1500 1800 g the external surface was smooth and glistening no nodularity was noted the cut surface showed a nutmeg appearance suggestive of passive venous congestion no mass lesion was identified
the spleen was enlarged and weighed 230 g rr150 200 g external and cut surface showed congestion both kidneys pancreas stomach intestines heart and brain were externally and on cut sections unremarkable
histological examination of the lung depicted tumor cells in cohesive sheets having a peritheliomatous arrangement amidst predominantly necrotic areas the tumor cells were round to oval had coarsely stippled chromatin with scant to mildly eosinophilic cytoplasm nucleoli were inconspicuous and mitosis was brisk numerous apoptotic bodies were also noted 2c

"a 54 year old female patient presented to our clinic with complaints of occasional pain numbness and paralysis of her right hand she began to notice weakness of her left hand that had begun 2 years earlier she had no history of trauma and no family history of amyloid neuropathy she had a history of ovarian tumor 25 years ago and thyroid tumor 5 years ago both of which healed after surgical resection
physical examination revealed a mass 5 × 3 cm in the ulnar side of her left proximal forearm shown in figure  the lesion was firm nonpulsatile and tender on palpitation she had numbness on the ulnar side of her left hand and fingers the 2 point discrimination test revealed that 15 mm at the lateral side of the ring finger 10 mm at the little finger she had muscle weakness with abduction and adduction of the ring finger and the little finger but no deficit in the range of motion in the elbow the electrophysiological study revealed a significant decrease in the motor nerve conduction velocity of the ulnar nerve from distal to the mass to proximal to the mass mri revealed that the ulnar nerve was swollen longitudinally had a spindle shape and measured 30 × 27 cm in the axial plane and 72 cm longitudinally shown in figure  the swollen lesion had a relatively homogeneous isosignal intensity on t1 weighted images and had relative heterogeneous enhancement after the intravenous administration of gadolinium gd based contrast agent with the findings of flow void based on these findings the differential diagnoses included a vascular malformation that surrounded and compressed the ulnar nerve excisional biopsy was not performed because of the risk of hemorrhage and iatrogenic nerve injury the lesion was instead surgically explored with a longitudinal incision shown in figure  the operative findings showed no vascular malformation however the ulnar nerve fascicles were swollen and degenerated the affected lesion had changed into a yellow tissue shown in figure  after the yellow tissue was carefully removed microscopically approximately 7 cm defects remained between intact nerve fascicles the resected tissue was hard and had a stick like shape shown in figure 
the histopathological examination showed degenerated connective tissue with diffuse eosinophilic deposition which included calcification ossification and chondroid tissue shown in figure and b no intact nerve tissue remained the deposit was positive for congo red stain and appeared apple green under polarized light which suggested the diagnosis of amyloid neuropathy shown in figure 
immunohistochemical staining showed that the deposit was immunopositive for light chain λ antibody shown in figure  the deposit was immunonegative for amyloid a transthyretin and light chain κ therefore the pathological diagnosis was al amyloidosis
to determine the association with systemic involvement we conducted screening examinations bone marrow aspiration cerebrospinal fluid examination echocardiography electromyography of the legs chest computed tomography and mri of the brain and legs showed negative results physical examination revealed no sign of macroglossia or purpura on the skin autonomic dysfunction including orthostatic hypotension was not present the only positive results were from the blood test which showed high serum levels of amyloid protein a 1592 μgml 80

"the patient was a 58 year old woman suffering from lower abdominal pain and vomiting which gradually worsened from the start of december 2017 an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed multiple gastric ulcers and scars and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed inflammation in the large intestine the patient had undergone surgery in 1997 for cervical carcinoma followed by postoperative radiotherapy that involved irradiation of her pelvis and stomach on the basis of the symptoms endoscopy findings and medical history the patient was diagnosed with refractory multiple gastric ulcers enterocolitis and paralytic ileus due to late radiation induced sequelae
as a result of frequent vomiting the patient had become unable to ingest orally she was hospitalized in october 2018 and fasted before being placed under central venous nutrition control hyperbaric oxygen therapy was started to treat the intractable multiple gastric ulcers and ileus thirty treatment sessions were scheduled over a period of approximately 1–2 months pentazocine and tramadol were administered to treat the abdominal pain but these achieved poor results
at hospitalization the patient was 155 cm tall and weighed 43 kg although she exhibited abdominal distention no muscular defense or rebound pain was observed on percussion the bowel sound was attenuated a blood examination revealed anemia slight liver dysfunction low protein levels and hypoalbuminemia an abdominal x ray showed several small intestinal niveau and extension of the colon and small intestine by intestinal gas fig a
the patient experienced increased lower abdominal pain during bowel movements and felt relieved after defecation consequently we hypothesized that her abdominal pain was due to poor peristalsis of the intestinal tract and that blocking the sympathetic nerve of the intestinal tract would help normalize the peristaltic movement and relieve the pain the pain was strongest in the lower abdomen at the level of the 12th thoracic nerve an epidural catheter was inserted via the lumbar1–2 intervertebral space and continuous epidural anesthesia with 02 ropivacaine at 4 mlh was administered for 1 week resulting in good control of the lower abdominal pain and defecation this allowed the tramadol which promotes constipation to be discontinued a block of the inferior mesenteric artery plexus with ethanol was performed resulting in an immediate improvement in the patient’s bowel movements and defecation and a reduction in lower abdominal pain now measured as 3 on a numerical rating scale nrs  3 an abdominal x ray was performed after the block procedure showing the number of intestinal niveau and the amount of gas had decreased as compared to that before the block fig b the control of lower abdominal pain was effective and defecation was noted tube feeding was started 4 days after the inferior mesenteric artery plexus block and oral feeding was started 2 days later
twelve days after the block the patient’s lower abdominal pain increased to nrs 8 and there was recrudescence of the vomiting an abdominal computed tomography ct scan showed dilation of the small intestine as well as the formation of niveau however no bowel obstruction or disruption of blood flow was observed fig a
an upper gastrointestinal contrast examination with contrast medium gastrografin® bayer yakuhin ltd osaka japan showed relatively good peristaltic movement of the large and small intestine but poor gastric peristaltic movement a large amount of food residue was also observed an epidural catheter was inserted via the thoracic 6–7 intervertebral space for innervation of the upper gastrointestinal tract including the stomach and small intestine and continuous epidural anesthesia with 02 ropivacaine at 4 mlh was started this alleviated the abdominal pain and the vomiting disappeared
approximately 2 weeks later continuous epidural anesthesia was stopped and a splanchnic nerve block with ethanol was performed fig c this resulted in an improvement in the lower abdominal pain to nrs 1 as well as an increase in food intake the following day ct showed a large improvement in the ileus fig b an upper gastrointestinal contrast examination showed that peristaltic movement of the upper gastrointestinal tract had improved fig  the subsequent course was good and the hyperbaric oxygen therapy was completed the patient was discharged from hospital at the end of january at the outpatient visit 2 weeks later the general condition of the patient was good and she could orally intake her normal diet",inclusion criteria patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 age 65 years or older to be under follow up in the same center for at least one year exclusion criteria younger than 65 years old having decompensated liver disease psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy,0.5

initial laboratory testing included syphilis serology lyme disease borrelia antibodies determination of hgb electrolyte status ace blood count crp and esr the results of all the tests were negative or normal except lyme disease serology igg 239 pos igm 9 neg low ace 2 ul and eosinophilic cells high
an mri performed 1 week later revealed enlargement and enhancement in the left nerve sheath from the eye to the chiasma in line with the findings seen in opn  and 
at a new consultation 1 month after her first visit bcva was unchanged a visual field test revealed a general constriction of the visual field of the left eye with equivalent neural capacity of 99 in his right eye and 33 in his left eye fundus examination showed progression of the left optic disc edema  rapd was still present new laboratory tests that included esr crp ace and sarcoidosis revealed nothing abnormal
one month later 2 months after her first examination the left optic disc edema had regressed but an rapd was still present visual acuity was unchanged since her last visit treatment with prednisone was initiated 60 mgday which was tapered to 25 mgday over 4 weeks when she was examined again
at a fourth consultation 3 months after her first visit visual acuity was 08 in both eyes a sst color vision test revealed that the patient had more defective color vision in her left eye 35 p compared to the right 15 p the optic disc edema was reduced the steroid dose was tapered to 5 mgday during 3 weeks at this point the patient suffered her first relapse with dimmed vision in her left eye fundus examination 1 week later revealed a pale papilla bcva was now 08 in her right eye and 04 in her left eye steroid dose was increased to 30 mgday and tapered to 20 mgday until the next appointment 2 weeks later some days later the patient was hospitalized with arrhythmia due to hypercalcemia and hyperkalemia at the new consultation visual acuity was 08 in her right eye and 05 in her left eye

"this patient a five year old african american female fell at school and developed severe left knee pain three days after falling the patients mother contacted her primary care physician where she reported her daughters severe left knee pain that prevented her from walking and had worsened since the initial injury at this point the patients left knee was also warm and erythematous she and her daughter were referred to her local emergency department where radiographs of the patients left knee were conducted and were read as unremarkable with no signs of trauma  the patient was therefore diagnosed with a left knee sprain and was treated conservatively with pain control ice and nsaids and nwb without further intervention
eleven days later the patient was seen by her primary care physician for her persistent limp and intermittent pain although her swelling had resolved anteroposterior view of the pelvis and bilateral frog lateral radiographs were ordered to rule out any hip pathologies which could also cause an antalgic gait all films were read by an attending radiologist and were deemed unremarkable relying on these reads the primary care physician recommended the patient to continue supportive care nsaids and ice for pain nonweight bearing for left lower extremity and to refer to an orthopedist if symptoms persisted
despite these treatments the patients pain and limp persisted and the patient then sought a referral to a general pediatric orthopedist for further work up although the childs pain had slightly improved her limp remained she described her left knee pain as worse at night but responsive to acetaminophen and ice she had never felt anything like this before prior to her initial fall both the patient and her mother denied fever weight loss fatigue malaise or recent infection on physical exam her left knee did not have a palpable mass muscle atrophy or edema but was tender to palpation given concern for the persistent pain and antalgic gait repeat radiographs of the left knee were also ordered by the orthopedist and showed aggressive poorly defined lytic lesion centered within the left distal femur metadiaphysis extending up proximally 6 cm superiorly from the metaphysis with associated interrupted superior periosteal involvement  a radiologist reviewed these findings and agreed with the orthopedist that based on these radiographic findings there was concern for a primary bone malignancy arthrocentesis of the left knee was performed to rule out a possible infectious etiology which was negative acute phase reactants including c reactive protein sedimentation rate and leukocyte count were all within normal limits magnetic resonance imaging mri and needle biopsy were ordered to establish diagnosis contrast enhanced mri examination showed a enhancing mass centered in the distal femoral metaphysis approximately 7 cm in craniocaudal dimension with aggressive periosteal involvement  needle biopsy of the left distal femur was performed at the site of the lesion and pathology demonstrated cores of tumor tissue consisting of pleomorphic tumor cells with frequent mitoses foci of necrosis regions of chondroblastic differentiation and rare small foci of malignant osteoid production consistent with the diagnosis of osteosarcoma additional imaging including chest computerized tomography ct and whole body positron emission tomography pet was obtained for tumor staging and demonstrated no evidence of distant metastases
the patient was then referred to an orthopedic surgeon to discuss treatment options including oncologic and operative interventions given the concern for pathological fracture and possible subsequent contamination of healthy tissue from this tumor the patient was placed in a knee immobilizer to limit weight bearing nwb lle with walker the patient and her parents were referred to an oncologist to determine a chemotherapy plan a typical treatment plan of osteosarcoma involves surgical resection and six cycles of chemotherapy two cycles preoperatively as neoadjuvant therapy and four cycles postoperatively with high dose methotrexate doxorubicindexrazoxane and cisplatin
operative treatments were discussed between the family and the attending orthopaedic surgeon in great detail including potential risks and benefits and the family chose to proceed with van nes rotationplasty radical resection of the left distal femur 17 cm from the joint line with femurtibia osteoplasty with internal fixation and van nes rotationplasty of the left lower extremity and left sciatic neuroplasty was performed the procedure lasted around eight hours long without complications estimated blood loss was 100 ml or less the patient was transferred to the picu for monitoring postoperatively there were no wound complications postoperatively and the patient received trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and cefepime for antibiotic prophylaxis nine days later the patient was discharged with referrals to physical therapy and the appropriative postoperative wound care instructions
the patient was treated with chemotherapy for five months postoperatively and responded well since finishing chemotherapy treatments the patient has continued with physical therapy and has been fitted for a lower extremity prosthetic postoperative radiographs have demonstrated appropriate healing of the rotationplasty  six month postoperative positron emission tomography pet showed no evidence of local or distant metastatic disease there was minimal uptake in the left lower extremity at the location of the rotationplasty the procedure with the appropriate adjuvant chemotherapy was deemed successful",inclusion criteria patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus patients 18 years of age or older patients admitted under medical or surgical services patients treated with diet alone insulin sq insulin pump or oral hypoglycemic medications have their own continuous glucose monitoring cgm monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission exclusion criteria individuals under 18 years of age covid 19 infection infection of the skin at the cgm site requiring removal of the sensor patients with altered mental status patients unable to scan their flash cgms at least every 8 hours inability to provide written consent hospitalized for less than 24 hours,0.5

the finding was explained and the patient agreed for the surgical excision of superficial parotid gland tissue under general anesthesia
after skin preparation with povidone solution access to the cyst was made through the lower neck incision at the deepest neck crest which is found to be posteroinferior to the cyst this helps to minimize the postoperative scarring and avoid from puncturing the cyst the incision was then extended to the mastoid posterior and inferior auricles the incision was then performed layer by layer until it reached the platysma muscle this muscle was dissected to expose the underneath cyst capsule once the plane between cyst capsule and platysma muscle was identified the blunt dissection was carried out carefully separating the cyst from the sternocleidomastoid muscle posteriorly and the posterior belly of digastric muscle underneath with the preservation of facial nerve however the upper part of the cyst was found embedded in the parotid tissue so part of the superficial lobe of the left parotid gland was excised together with the cyst the specimen was then sent for histopathological examination hpe
patient recovery was nonincidental with no evidence of facial nerve palsy and wound infection
the hpe showed a collapsed cyst wall with adjacent salivary gland and small reactive lymphoid tissue the cyst was lined by thin ciliated columnar epithelium in some areas cuboidal in other areas and flat squamous cells in still other areas however no nuclear atypia was seen the appearance was that of a lymphoepithelial cyst lec the lymphoid tissue was of both diffuse and follicular nature figures –",inclusion criteria age greater than or equal to 18 years sustained rosc within 60 minutes of arrest patient is comatose unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands after resuscitation exclusion criteria cerebral perfusion partially or fully dependant functional status prior to index cardiac event acute traumatic brain injury sah massive stroke or intracranial hemorrhage initiation of monitoring is not feasible for logistical reasons urgent surgery planned severe co morbidity or terminal illness which makes survival to 3 months unlikely pregnancy,0.5
"a 43 year old mexican hispanic man arrived in our hospital with a chronic headache his neurological examination was unremarkable the imaging workup showed a giant basilar artery aneurysm dimensions 32 mm × 20 mm figure  and that the lesion was located at an angled portion of the vessel for the management of this aneurysm we decided to place a stent at the aneurysm neck in order to 1 straighten the shape of the parent vessel 2 promote a shift in the pattern of the inflow into the sac and the outflow from the lesion and 3 foster the thrombosis of the aneurysm
the lesion was reached through a left vertebral approach with a 6f guiding catheter envoy cordis miami lakes fl the medical periprocedural management at that time 1997 was empirical as no rules for anticoagulation or antiplatelet treatment had been defined for intracranial stents the vascular neurologist advised that the patient be placed under full anticoagulation without any antiplatelet drug a 35 mm × 12 mm balloon expandable stent bes ave medtronic advanced vascular engineering santa rosa ca was advanced and deployed at the neck of the lesion figures 
when trying to retrieve the balloon the stent slipped backwards and its distal end tilted towards the sac figures  we therefore decided to carefully slip the stent forward into the aneurysm by inflating the balloon again and pushing the stent distally until the whole of it was floating within the aneurysm figures  a 35 mm × 18 mm bes was advanced into the lesion and subsequently deployed within the parent artery to cover the full length of the diseased portion of the vessel including the aneurysm neck figure  in the immediate post procedural angiographic runs we observed a sluggish intra aneurysmal vortex motion and a correction of the shape of the parent vessel to a 45 degree angle was conducted the neurological status of the patient was unchanged and he was then discharged to the neurosurgical ward
a control digital subtraction angiography dsa performed four hours later to counter clinical deterioration showed thrombosis of the aneurysm along the basilar artery figure  rapid recanalization of the vessel was obtained through a mechanical procedure balloon angioplasty with the use of antiplatelet treatment ticlopidine 250 mg and aspirin 100 mg figure  the patient subsequently recovered and this episode left a pontine stroke as a sequela figure 
at ten years after the operation the patient has a minor paresis with a modified rankin scale of 2 a new imaging follow up with dsa and three dimensional reconstruction has been performed which showed that the aneurysm remains occluded no recanalization the parent vessel is still patent and no in stent stenosis is present figure to  the clinical evolution of the patient is described in table 1",inclusion criteria patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 age 65 years or older to be under follow up in the same center for at least one year exclusion criteria younger than 65 years old having decompensated liver disease psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy,0.5

x rays of the femur were done in anteroposterior and lateral views  which showed an irregular hypertrophic cortical reaction with the bony remodeling in the proximal femur and an excavated lateral femoral cortex with a broken intramedullary nail in situ
magnetic resonance imaging mri of the right thigh was done which showed a large well defined and heterogenous soft tissue mass on the anterolateral aspect t1 and t2 images post contrast images showed a heterogeneous and patchy uptake  these findings were consistent with a soft tissue tumor we however did not perform a computed tomography ct scan for this patient
after the mri we decided to do a closed needle biopsy along the previous surgical scar under local anesthesia in the operating theatre the biopsy report was inconclusive demonstrating fibrinous blood material and granulation tissue suggestive of a chronic hematoma
as the patient was symptomatic we decided to plan a surgical excision of the lesion under epidural anesthesia in the supine position the skin incision was taken along the previous scar on the lateral aspect of the thigh granulation tissue and fibrosed muscles overlying the mass were carefully separated we noticed a mass adherent to the lateral aspect of the femur extending intramedullary up to the implant using a cautery we separated the mass from the bone extending up to the intramedullary nail the excised specimen measured 24 cm in length and 15 cm in breadth an intraoperative frozen section analysis was done that revealed a chronic inflammatory reaction and no evidence of sarcoma the defect after excision of the mass was filled with frozen allograft the excised specimen was solid with a fibrotic wall on gross examination after dissecting the specimen a mop was found  and 
the sample was sent for histological study which revealed fibrous strands clots hemolyzed pigments of red blood cells inflammatory cells and multiple fiber strands the foreign material was studied under polarized light  and confirmed the diagnosis of gossypiboma by demonstrating cotton fibers the specimen was reported as an accumulation of blood products and their degraded components and not a tumor

"a 26 year old female with cf genotype f508delf508del with a baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 s fev1 of 21 predicted and a 6 l home oxygen requirement was undergoing evaluation for bilateral lung transplantation her medical history included recurrent respiratory infections with multi drug resistant pathogens pancreatic insufficiency malnutrition requiring percutaneous gastrostomy feeds atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia status post ablation and the recent delivery of a healthy baby she had no history of biliary tract stones cirrhosis hepatitis b or hepatitis c as part of the lung transplantation workup a ct scan of the chest abdomen and pelvis revealed a new peripherally enhancing 63 cm mass in the right lobe of her liver and subsequent mri suggested intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma at this time the patient reported feeling a hard mass under her right ribs along with intermittent right upper quadrant pain and fullness anorexia weight loss and daily subjective fevers for several weeks
ultrasound guided biopsy identified the mass as an adenocarcinoma with positive staining for cytokeratin 7 ck7 gata 3 a transcription factor important in the regulation of certain genes and p40 a marker of squamous differentiation notably the tumor was negative for estrogen receptor er thyroid transcription factor 1 ttf 1 cytokeratin 20 ck20 and high risk human papillomavirus ribonucleic acid in situ hybridization hr hpv rna ish and therefore did not support tumor origin of breast or gynecologic lung lower gastrointestinal or cervical or headneck respectively serum tumor markers demonstrated normal alpha fetoprotein afp and carcinoembryonic antigen cea levels but a markedly elevated carbohydrate antigen ca19–9 level of 59495 uml 0–36 uml which can be elevated in pancreatic gastric hepatobiliary and colonic malignancies given the tumor location serum markers and pathology findings the tumor was thought to be most consistent with a primary cholangiocarcinoma
the patient underwent complete staging following hospital discharge where radiation therapy with curative intent was recommended ultimately her poor performance status chronic pulmonary disease and risk of severe life threatening infection influenced the decision not to pursue systemic chemotherapy or surgery as the initial treatment modality however prior to starting treatment she developed pneumonia leading to acute respiratory failure requiring intubation a second ct of the chest abdomen and pelvis 4 weeks from the initial ct revealed the liver mass had grown to 136 × 10 cm and there were patchy pulmonary consolidations concerning for both pneumonia and metastatic disease positron emission tomography pet scan demonstrated uptake in the lungs bilaterally mediastinal lymph nodes right iliac and right femur consistent with metastatic disease given her critical condition it was decided she was no longer a candidate for treatment of her cancer she was transitioned to home hospice where she passed away approximately 10 weeks after the initial ct

intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma can resemble adenocarcinomas from other sites and because there are no histologic markers that can reliably make the distinction it is often difficult to distinguish them from metastatic tumors  due to a lack of a dominant tumor at other possible primary sites at autopsy and a morphology showing anastomosing glands in a fibrotic stroma with focal squamous differentiation cholangiocarcinoma was favored in this case",inclusion criteria age greater than or equal to 18 years sustained rosc within 60 minutes of arrest patient is comatose unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands after resuscitation exclusion criteria cerebral perfusion partially or fully dependant functional status prior to index cardiac event acute traumatic brain injury sah massive stroke or intracranial hemorrhage initiation of monitoring is not feasible for logistical reasons urgent surgery planned severe co morbidity or terminal illness which makes survival to 3 months unlikely pregnancy,0.5
"a 68 year old male presented to the outpatient endoscopy unit for a repeat eus drainage of a pp
the patient has a background history of necrotising gallstone pancreatitis that was treated supportively a subsequent laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed unfortunately he developed a pp that required eus guided drainage approximately 12 months following his index presentation a surveillance ct abdomen demonstrated a large recurrence of his pp approximately 13 cm in largest diameter thus a decision for repeat drainage was made his other comorbidities include chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder hypertension and a solitary kidney donor nephrectomy
a linear echoendoscope was advanced to the second part of the duodenum external compression of the posterior gastric wall was observed endoscopically endosonographically the pp measured 13 x 10 cm and was punctured using a 19 gauge access needle approximately 10 ml of clear fluid was aspirated and then injected with 20 ml of contrast a 450 mm jagwire was passed through the needle into the pseudocyst under fluoroscopy the access needle was exchanged for a cystotome a cystpogastrostomy was performed using the cystotome and a second 450 mm jagwire was inserted the cystotome was removed and two 7 french plastic double pigtail stents were introduced into the pp over the two guidewires under direct fluoroscopy both stents appeared to have been positioned satisfactorily and were draining clear fluid into the stomach figure 
the patient developed severe abdominal pain in the recovery bay an urgent ct abdomen demonstrated free fluid and gas in the upper abdomen especially anterior to the liver figure  a decision was made to proceed to the operating theatre given concerns for a perforated hollow viscus
a midline laparotomy was performed significant amounts of gastric and pancreatic juices were found throughout the entire peritoneal cavity and evacuated the gastrocolic ligament was taken down with the harmonic scalpel to allow access to the pancreas the cystogastrostomy tract and stents were found to have inadvertently entered the peritoneal cavity figure  and thus were removed
a decision was made to surgically decompress the pp given the high likelihood of recurrence an anterior longitudinal gastrotomy was performed there was difficulty locating the pp through the posterior stomach wall as it had collapsed having spilled its contents into abdominal cavity the pp cavity was not identifiable despite using an intraoperative ultrasound ious an 8 french infant feeding tube was inserted through the peritoneal defect caused by the transgastric stent and placed into the pp cavity the feeding tube was subsequently injected with saline figure 
a subsequent attempt at transgastric localisation of the pp was successful using ious given the re expansion of the pp a seeking needle was then used to confirm the location of the pp a 45 mm endo gia medtronic plc minneapolis mn stapler was used to complete the cystogastrostomy and the edges oversewn with 3 0 prolene figure  the anterior gastrotomy wound was closed with 3 0 pds the pp defect and corresponding gastrotomy defect were closed with 3 0 pds a feeding jejunostomy was fashioned the abdomen was washed with saline and two drains placed one on the anterior stomach and one on the closed pseudocyst defect
the patient recovered well postoperatively a ct contrast swallow was organised on day 10 after the operation which demonstrated no evidence of any leak the abdominal drains were removed after drain amylase levels were found to be normal the patient was initially supported with postpyloric feeds through his feeding jejunostomy and then slowly transitioned back into a regular diet he was discharged from hospital two weeks after his operation he remains free from any recurrence 13 months after his surgery",inclusion criteria age greater than or equal to 18 years sustained rosc within 60 minutes of arrest patient is comatose unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands after resuscitation exclusion criteria cerebral perfusion partially or fully dependant functional status prior to index cardiac event acute traumatic brain injury sah massive stroke or intracranial hemorrhage initiation of monitoring is not feasible for logistical reasons urgent surgery planned severe co morbidity or terminal illness which makes survival to 3 months unlikely pregnancy,0.5

to obtain more specific and fine grained information on peter’s emotional regulation during a standardized observational procedure
during the play episode peter was specifically sensitive to tactile eg mother caressing and auditory eg mother singing stimulations in response to this kind of stimulations peter showed positive emotionality eg rhythmic movements of the chest and arms together with wide mouth opening during the still face episode peter immediately appeared alert and sensitive to the suspension of maternal communication by exhibiting an immediate stress response ie increase of motor activity and emergence of disorganized movements of the chest and arms interestingly specific patterns of dyadic matching behaviors emerged including attempts to reach out with the arms directed to the mother’s body while simultaneously seeking eye contact with her in order to be picked up such relational regulatory strategies were something that peter usually did not show when distressed as he easily became disorganized
during the maternal unavailability episode peter shows a clear ability to regulate his own behavior and emotions through relational strategies something otherwise non observable with a different observational procedure although such regulatory strategies may not be usual for the infant it is clinically relevant to highlight that in response to specific relational and environmental adjustments ie face to face interaction lowered stimulation enough time to organize other directed attempts to self regulate peter can access to more adaptive strategies to achieve regulation this knowledge enriches the picture of peter difficulties in self stabilization and highlights a dyadic pattern to reinforce in order to support infant’s socio emotional regulation",inclusion criteria patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus patients 18 years of age or older patients admitted under medical or surgical services patients treated with diet alone insulin sq insulin pump or oral hypoglycemic medications have their own continuous glucose monitoring cgm monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission exclusion criteria individuals under 18 years of age covid 19 infection infection of the skin at the cgm site requiring removal of the sensor patients with altered mental status patients unable to scan their flash cgms at least every 8 hours inability to provide written consent hospitalized for less than 24 hours,0.5

these findings led us to investigate on the patient’s hypoalbuminemia proteinuria was excluded by normal spot urine albumincreatinine ratio and total proteincreatinine ratio other possible secondary causes of hypoalbuminemia such as inflammatory state and insufficient hepatic synthesis were ruled out by normal laboratory tests and abdominal ultrasonography the latter was negative except for mild hepatic steatosis all the other examined members of the family her parents her brother and her son showed albumin level close to the upper limit of the normal range suggesting that they may be heterozygous for a variation in the alb  for the above reasons we tested the hypothesis of caa by mutation analysis of the alb after we obtained informed consent we collected blood samples from all the available members of the family and two unrelated healthy volunteers as a control and extracted genomic dna from whole blood for a rapid identification of variations in the alb we used a gel based mutation detection strategy which we developed and applied to the identification of many other cases of caa shortly we pcr amplified the fourteen genomic fragments of the alb encompassing the fourteen coding exons and their intron exon junctions using the specific primer pairs described by watkins et al  the fragments were then examined by heteroduplex and sscp analysis the combination of these two techniques usually allowed us to identify the region of alb containing the molecular defect which was then submitted to direct dna sequencing in the present case heteroduplex analysis clearly indicated that the only detectable change in both homozygous and heterozygous samples occurred in the 386 bp long region amplified by using pcr primers a23a and a24a encompassing exon 12 and the intron 11 exon 12 and exon 12 intron 13 junctions figure  all the other members of the family are heterozygous since they show the presence of four bands corresponding to homoduplex and heteroduplex pcr products figure  lanes 2 2′ 3 3′ 4 4’ 5 5’ the homozygous sample figure  lanes 1 and 1′ revealed only one band but with a different mobility when compared with controls figure  lanes 6 7 6′ and 7′ no variation due to conformation polymorphism could be seen under these electrophoretic conditions data not shown the results of the dna sequence analysis performed on the abnormal fragment showed that our patient is homozygous for a ca deletion near the 3′ end of exon 12 at nucleotide positions c 1614 1615 according to the human genome variation society rules ie starting from the initiator codon figure  the subsequent frame shift should give rise to a predicted translation product of 516 amino acid residues instead of the 585 found in the mature protein pleu540phefs2 in which the sequence cys538 thr leu ser has been changed to cys538 thr phe stop unfortunately we could not perform a search for this truncated variant in the serum of our patient but no evidence was found so far for the presence of the putative albumin molecule produced in all the cases of caa studied at the molecular level the electropherograms from the parents confirmed that they are both heterozygous for the same mutation data not shown this result brought to the molecular diagnosis of caa in our patient
based on the biochemical findings and on the mutation analysis of the alb the final diagnosis was caa and hypercholesterolemia the latter not of genetic origin
caa did not require albumin infusions while hypercholesterolemia was successfully treated with atorvastatin a low cholesterol low saturated fat diet was prescribed without any significant effect on serum lipid total cholesterol increased from 321 mgdl to 334 mgdl ldl from 161 mgdl to 192 mgdl successful and well tolerated treatment with atorvastatin was started at the initial daily dose of 10 mg od increased to 20 mg od from baseline total and ldl cholesterol dropped by 23 and 47 respectively hdl cholesterol increased by 22 while apolipoprotein b decreased by 25 apolipoprotein a showed no relevant modifications this observation together with the low blood pressure might explain why despite the high lipid levels evident clinical signs of early atherosclerosis have not been observed in the patient no plaques on carotid artery walls where found at ultrasound imaging study

based on the emergency file it was found that the boy fell at school three weeks ago clinical examination revealed that 11 had a lateral luxation with an uncomplicated crown fracture and 21 had a subluxation emergency treatment was carried out on the same day and consisted of reattaching the tooth fragment repositioning 11 with a gentle digital pressure and stabilizing it with a flexible splint one week after trauma the patient presented with intraoral swelling on 11 revealing necrosis consequently an endodontic treatment was performed and the root canal was instrumented using hand files with gentle irrigation using 05 sodium hypochlorite calcium hydroxide was placed as intracanal medication the access cavity was sealed with glass ionomer cement
for this purpose the apexification technique using calcium hydroxide has been initiated on 11 the calcium hydroxide was renewed once resorbed a regular clinical and radiological follow up was carried out to check the vitality of 21 
6 months after the beginning of the treatment of 11 a radiolucent lesion in the periapical region was detected on 21  the negative response to the cold test confirms a pulp necrosis considering the immaturity of the tooth and the thinness of the root and after obtaining parental consent the optimal treatment option was revascularization
an access cavity was made under a dental dam once the canal orifice was well cleared gentle root canal irrigation was performed with 2 sodium hypochlorite followed by irrigation with saline solution subsequently the root canal was dried with large paper points until they were removed without evidence of fluids and filled with calcium hydroxide used as intracanal medication a temporary restoration using a glass ionomer was placed
the patient was recalled 4 weeks after the first appointment the tooth was clinically and radiologically asymptomatic in the second session the tooth was anaesthetized accessed and irrigated gently with 2 sodium hypochlorite followed by saline solution to remove calcium hydroxide the bleeding was induced with manual k files introduced into the root canal and placed at 2 mm beyond the working length once the blood clot was formed mta was placed in the cervical third of the root canal  the access cavity was sealed with a glass ionomer
three months after performing revascularization treatment visible root edification was observed  the 6 month follow up showed an important thickening of the root with calcification of the canal concerning 11 a renewal of the calcium hydroxide was carried out once the material has been absorbed 
after 24 months of apexification treatment on 11 we noticed the formation of an apical barrier which was easily crossable with a file  to solve that problem the apical third was sealed using mta and then the coronal two third with warm gutta percha concerning 21 the canal was almost completely obliterated with an extension of the root",inclusion criteria patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 age 65 years or older to be under follow up in the same center for at least one year exclusion criteria younger than 65 years old having decompensated liver disease psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy,0.5

"a 43 year old mexican hispanic man arrived in our hospital with a chronic headache his neurological examination was unremarkable the imaging workup showed a giant basilar artery aneurysm dimensions 32 mm × 20 mm figure  and that the lesion was located at an angled portion of the vessel for the management of this aneurysm we decided to place a stent at the aneurysm neck in order to 1 straighten the shape of the parent vessel 2 promote a shift in the pattern of the inflow into the sac and the outflow from the lesion and 3 foster the thrombosis of the aneurysm
the lesion was reached through a left vertebral approach with a 6f guiding catheter envoy cordis miami lakes fl the medical periprocedural management at that time 1997 was empirical as no rules for anticoagulation or antiplatelet treatment had been defined for intracranial stents the vascular neurologist advised that the patient be placed under full anticoagulation without any antiplatelet drug a 35 mm × 12 mm balloon expandable stent bes ave medtronic advanced vascular engineering santa rosa ca was advanced and deployed at the neck of the lesion figures 
when trying to retrieve the balloon the stent slipped backwards and its distal end tilted towards the sac figures  we therefore decided to carefully slip the stent forward into the aneurysm by inflating the balloon again and pushing the stent distally until the whole of it was floating within the aneurysm figures  a 35 mm × 18 mm bes was advanced into the lesion and subsequently deployed within the parent artery to cover the full length of the diseased portion of the vessel including the aneurysm neck figure  in the immediate post procedural angiographic runs we observed a sluggish intra aneurysmal vortex motion and a correction of the shape of the parent vessel to a 45 degree angle was conducted the neurological status of the patient was unchanged and he was then discharged to the neurosurgical ward

ct abdomen with oral and intravenous contrast was organized to further investigate the tubular foreign body it revealed concurrent gastric band erosion into gastric lumen and connection tubing eroding into the posterior wall of transverse colon and exiting inferiorly figs – there was no evidence of any oral contrast leak from the stomach
this patient has previously been admitted for acute diverticulitis 4 years prior reviewing prior imaging did not reveal any gastric or colonic erosion the gastric band tubing is noted to be running along the inflamed colon since the initial admission for acute diverticulitis she has had multiple further acute diverticulitis episodes which were treated with oral antibiotics we suspect recurrent diverticulitis lead to the erosion of the gastric band into the colon and stomach
as part of the surgical management both colorectal and upper gi surgeon were involved in the operation patient underwent laparoscopic removal of gastric band and laparoscopic assisted wedge resection of transverse colon the gastric band was removed following adhesiolysis and the gastric defect was repaired with intracorporeal suturing the gastric band port was subsequently removed gastroscopy was done to ensure the repair was airtight for the colectomy transverse colon and splenic flexure was mobilized laparoscopically and the transverse colon was extracted through the gastric band port site for external inspection a tract was identified passing from the antimesenteric border to colonic lumen and then along the colonic mesentery a wedge resection performed with stapler end to side anastomosis flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed to confirm the anastomosis was airtight her post operative recovery was uneventful and she continued to be well on post operative follow up in clinic she remains well on subsequent phone follow up 12 months post operatively",inclusion criteria patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 age 65 years or older to be under follow up in the same center for at least one year exclusion criteria younger than 65 years old having decompensated liver disease psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy,0.5

"a six month old caucasian male with no significant past medical history presented to the pediatric emergency department for a chief complaint of frequent unusual eye movements as reported by the parents the patient began having intermittent rotary nystagmus approximately three weeks ago and since then it progressed and became more continuous worsened by changes in position or flashing lights from toys brought in his visual field the parents also noticed the patient sleeping more than usual only staying awake for an hour at a time and had a subsequent severe regression in milestones with an inability to roll over or sit unsupported
initial workup in the emergency department included a ct brain without contrast which showed evidence of thickening of the bilateral optic nerves with associated masses and diffuse bilateral ventriculomegaly figure  this finding was concerning for possible bilateral optic pathway gliomas at which point a dedicated mri of the brain and orbits was recommended along with further genetic workup for possible neurofibromatosis i
mri of the brain and orbits confirmed these findings showing diffuse enlargement of the optic tracts extending from the lateral geniculate nuclei to the optic chiasm and into the bilateral optic nerves with a mass demonstrating 270º encasement of the bilateral supraclinoid internal carotid arteries and near circumferential encasement of the bilateral a1 segments of the anterior cerebral arteries figures  
these imaging findings confirmed the suspicion of bilateral optic pathway glioma and as a result the patient was admitted to the hospital and evaluated by both neurosurgery and pediatric hematology oncology neurosurgery did not recommend any surgical intervention at the time and the hematology oncology team recommended proceeding with chemotherapy his genetic testing results showed no evidence of clinically significant variants of neurofibromatosis i or ii suggesting a sporadic bilateral optic pathway glioma the patient was then discharged and was followed up on an outpatient basis by both ophthalmology and pediatric hematology oncology for maintenance chemotherapy with carboplatin and vincristine",inclusion criteria patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus patients 18 years of age or older patients admitted under medical or surgical services patients treated with diet alone insulin sq insulin pump or oral hypoglycemic medications have their own continuous glucose monitoring cgm monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission exclusion criteria individuals under 18 years of age covid 19 infection infection of the skin at the cgm site requiring removal of the sensor patients with altered mental status patients unable to scan their flash cgms at least every 8 hours inability to provide written consent hospitalized for less than 24 hours,0.5
"the case was of a 22 year old woman complaining of headache for 18 months with severe episodes lasting around 6 hours recurring about twice a month pain was located on the parietal regions spreading to the orbit attacks were accompanied by nausea severe enough to hinder routine activities the case was assessed by several specialists ruling out neurological ophthalmological and otorhinolaryngological pathologies cranial computed tomography ct and magnetic resonance imaging mri revealed no pathology previous treatments considered nonsteroidal analgesics physical therapy hot and ice packs applications and low level laser therapy all of them did not relieve pain to a satisfactory level her neurologist referred her to the orthodontic clinic suspecting a dilemma somewhere in her braces the patient had fixed orthodontic appliance in the lower arch only with right first premolar extracted and space was closed with a satisfactory treatment outcome
clinical examination showed good oral hygiene with no signs of periodontal disease panoramic radiography opg was normal occlusion was normal with no temporomandibular joint disorders however the patient reported that headache started 4 weeks after brackets bonding at this stage the patient was referred to a specialized center to test salivary biochemistry particularly nickel and chromium levels the chemical analyses were performed with a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer using unstimulated salivary sample
after consultation with patients neurologist a decision was made to remove braces as soon as possible and provide her with a cadcam zirconium bar as a bonded mandibular fixed retainer as the patient refused to wear any removable appliance the treatment objectives were to 1 remove braces and retain teeth at their present position and 2 fabricate a bonded mandibular fixed retainer being biocompatible in attempt to relieve the patients complaint
occlusal rests of 2 mm depth were prepared on the mesial surface of first premolars brackets were covered with wax prior to impression taking to facilitate its removal a definitive impression of the mandibular teeth was made with an alginate impression material and the master model was prepared from type iv stone resinrock whip mix europe dortmund germany the working cast was mounted on articulator and scanned in the s600 arti scanner ice zirkon zirkonzahn za9246a italy to transfer the baseline landmarks from the mandibular arch directly to the software  the cadcam design included a 18 mm width and a 14 mm thickness zirconium bar extended on the lingual surface of lower teeth from canine to canine and at 35 mm away from the free gingival margin occlusal rests were connected to the bar as well  the finished design was directly milled using zirkonzahns screw tec system
zirconium does not chemically adhere to enamel therefore the inner surface of the milled bar facing teeth was reduced manually and placed under an infrared lamp to dry for 40 minutes and then sintered overnight at 1600°c in a sintering furnace zirkonofen 700 later a thin layer of feldspathic ceramic was fired onto the bar  and subsequently received the treatments sandblast hydrofluoric acid etching and silane coupling while the outer part was glazed  the try of insertion of the entire bar into the patients mouth proceeded properly ensuring good marginal fitness the retainer was cemented with two dual cured cement types variolink ii and relyx arc the occlusal rest on the left side needed minimal reduction 
salivary spectrophotometry analysis showed that nickel concentration was 4230 μgl and chromium was 12520 μgl these concentrations were much lower than estimated toxic levels but comparable to the average dietary intake of nickel 200–300 μgday and chromium 280 μgday  several in vitro studies found that release reached a maximum within the first month of boding and then diminished due to formation of surface oxide film which resists corrosion thus slowing down the release of metals  however the case is different here where measurable amounts of nickel and chromium release were recorded after 22 months of treatment alerting possible association with the complaint
the patient reported pain relief two weeks following cementation and headache subsided completely after 6 weeks another atomic absorption spectrometer analysis was performed to test salivary nickel and chromium levels which showed negligible concentrations which might explain the patients complaint the patient was reviewed regularly for two years reporting no complaint  clinical evaluation appeared to give good functional value where the marginal fit of digitized cadcam design and glazed surface offered an enhanced approach of fixed retention",inclusion criteria an out of hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm glasgow coma scale gcs score less than or equal to 8 exclusion criteria patients with pre existent terminal renal insufficiency known glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency risk of hemolysis history of urolithiasis oxalate nephropathy or hemochromatosis treatment limitations,0.5
"a 68 years old male had undergone total mesorectal excision 10 years before a skeletal metastasis of the lower leg was diagnosed the patient was otherwise healthy except mild hypertension and there was no familial accumulation of endocrine or malignant diseases histology from the primary surgery showed a 5 cm intermediately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the rectum with no signs of neuroendocrine biology the tumor was ck7 negative and ck20 positive distance to the nearest circumferential margin was 3 mm and end resection margins were clear there was no infiltration in the removed lymph nodes nor signs of distant metastases thus the final tnm status was pt3n0m0 total calcium was normal 237 mmoll carcinoembryonic antigen cea dropped from 180 μgl preoperatively to 15 μgl after surgery no neo adjuvant or adjuvant radiochemotherapy was given during the primary treatment he underwent standard follow up regimen with bloodwork rectoscopies ultrasound of the liver and chest x ray for 4 years without any signs of relapse cea values were stable under 20 μgl and only 10 μgl when follow up was completed
ten years after surgery the patient presented with a tumor in the lower leg x ray and magnetic resonance imaging showed a 44 cm osteolytic lesion of the fibular head in addition to a 47 cm tumor in the left lung and paratracheal pathological lymph nodes biopsies of the fibular head confirmed adenocarcinoma negative for ck7 and positive for ck20 and the pathologist concluded metastasis from the rectal cancer the histological pattern was similar to the previously resected rectal tumor fig  cea had now increased to 154 μgl he was treated by radiation therapy to the leg 8 gy × 1 and commenced chemotherapy fluorouracil irinotecan calcium folinate and bevacizumab his lung pathology stabilized during this treatment and he reported less pain from the leg after the radiation therapy however the fibular tumor progressed radiologically and was 7 cm in diameter when it was resected 15 months after discovery resection margins were uncertain and he developed a wound infection with a chronic fistula to the skin
three months later the patient presented with hypercalcemia after being normocalcemic during all previous follow up due to rapidly growing inguinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes he started treatment with fluorouracil leucovorin and oxaliplatin flox ct scan showed stable disease after three cycles of therapy bloodwork revealed that cea had increased markedly to 380 μgl he developed severe hypercalcemia with free ionized calcium reaching 181 mmoll total calcium 333 mmoll concurrent with peaks in cea and pth levels fig  creatinine and estimated gfr was normal phosphorus was low 062 mmoll and 125 dihydroxyvitamin d was low 24 nmoll he had no arrhythmias or other clinical symptoms related to the hypercalcemia fluid therapy and zoledronic acid had only short lasting effect on the calcium levels pthrp was negative but intact pth was elevated to 544 pmoll normal range 11–75 pmoll the lab used a standard two site immunoassay for measurement of the 84 amino acid long pth requiring binding in both the n and c terminals for detection the high pth led us to consider primary hyperparathyroidism as a differential diagnosis ultrasound of the neck and parathyroid scintigraphy with 900 mbq of 99mtc methoxyisobutylisonitrile mibi showed no signs of parathyroid adenomas the diagnostic challenge was to distinguish primary hyperparathyroidism from ectopic pth production in a colorectal bone metastasis or potentially another tumor
to investigate if the tumor of the fibular head was responsible for the pth elevation we biopsied the tumor and stained for pth no significant staining was observed using monoclonal antibody immunohistochemistry because such a large tumor can contain different clones of cells a negative biopsy does not rule out that pth could be produced from a part of the tumor not represented in the biopsy also pth immunohistochemistry on bone biopsies could be false negative for unknown technical reasons we therefore measured blood pth levels while excluding the lower right leg from the circulation by use of a blood pressure cuff on the thigh modified casanova test  fig a pth levels measured in blood samples from the arm fell rapidly during the 20 min of right leg ischemia consistent with local pth production from the fibular tumor fig b
we concluded that the diagnosis was hypercalcemia caused by pth secretion from the bone metastasis in the fibular head and focused further treatment against the fibular tumor the osteoclast inhibitor denosumab 120 mg was administered subcutaneously and further radiotherapy was given to the lower leg 3 gy × 10 this made free calcium level stabilize at values around 140 mmoll and pth was also attenuated fig  the patient received further cycles with fliribevacizumab until a year before his death six months before the patient died another surge in pth and calcium levels arose now the patient received another course of radiotherapy 4 gy × 5 towards his fibula followed by a drop in pth levels and normalization of calcium levels no adverse events or side effects were reported by the patients or treating clinicians the patient did not develop further episodes of severe hypercalcemia during the remainder of his life and died approximately 24 months after the first incident of severe hypercalcemia due to disseminated disease involving skin lymph nodes lung pancreas and brain
as immunohistochemistry failed to show pth in the fibular bone metastasis we analyzed messenger ribonucleic acid mrna from the same biopsies post mortem despite the long interval from biopsy to rna extraction 5–16 years we were able to extract total rna from formalin fixed paraffine embedded ffpe tissue sections and quantified pth by reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr we found evidence of pth transcription in both the original rectal specimen and in the fibular biopsy taken after onset of hypercalcemia but not in the fibular biopsy that was taken before onset of hypercalcemia nor in ipsilateral inguinal lymph node metastasis fig  this is consistent with development of clinically significant pth production within the fibular metastasis after local recurrence and radiation therapy to the lower leg",inclusion criteria patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus patients 18 years of age or older patients admitted under medical or surgical services patients treated with diet alone insulin sq insulin pump or oral hypoglycemic medications have their own continuous glucose monitoring cgm monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission exclusion criteria individuals under 18 years of age covid 19 infection infection of the skin at the cgm site requiring removal of the sensor patients with altered mental status patients unable to scan their flash cgms at least every 8 hours inability to provide written consent hospitalized for less than 24 hours,0.5
