"A 5.5-year-old boy visited the Endocrinological section of the Pediatric Unit of the General Hospital of Terni, Italy, due to short stature. His mother's height was 170 cm, and his father's height was 172 cm (target height: 177.5 cm = >50° centile). In his family history, there was paternal familiarity for psychotic crises in his adolescence and mother with thrombophilia and history of five pregnancies with three spontaneous abortions and two parts. The mother took cardioaspirine during the pregnancy. No genetic disease was reported in his family. The child was born at term via spontaneous vaginal delivery. The birth weight was 3.050 gr (10°-25° centile), and the birth length was 45 cm (below the third centile). A villocentesis performed at week 12 of gestation due to an alteration in nuchal translucency on obstetric ultrasound did not reveal any abnormality (46, XY). After birth, a small ventricular septal defect and mild bilateral pyelectasis were detected, but within 6 months, both of these abnormalities spontaneously disappeared. Bilateral orchiopexy was performed at 19 months of age for undescended testicles. Regarding linear growth, auxological data recorded by the primary care pediatrician revealed short stature that was 2 standard deviation (SD) below the 3° centile on the Italian cross-sectional growth charts for height () since the first months of life. In the last 2 years, the child has exhibited an even more exacerbated decline in his growth curve. Before entering the hospital, first-level laboratory tests for the evaluation of short stature (i.e., full blood count, inflammatory markers, renal function, hepatic function, coeliac screening, and thyroid function tests) had been already performed. No abnormal results were evidenced. The bone age was delayed by 2 years.
In the hospital, his height was 99.2 cm (<3 SD), his weight was 15.5 kg (<3° centile), and his growth velocity was 4 cm/year (<3° centile). His arm span was of 94 cm, and his sitting height was of 55 cm: height ratio was <95%, his sitting height: height ratio was therefore >56% (slightly over the upper normal limit of 55.5%), and his body mass index was below the 50th centile (pathological Rappold index >8). Furthermore, he presented with unusual facial features that included hypertelorism, low-set ears, a low posterior hairline, down-slanting palpebral fissures, pectus excavatum, and ogival palate (Figure ).
However, Madelung deformity was not suggested by clinical examination and not detected by wrist X-ray findings. Radiological and laboratory tests to rule out related renal, cardiac, ophthalmologic, and audiological abnormalities did not find any significant alterations. At an evaluation conducted by an infant neuropsychiatrist, the patient exhibited a mild cognitive impairment compared with the standard for his age that included a prevalent verbal difficulty compatible with the diagnosis of NS. EEG and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging results were normal. The peak growth hormone (GH) value in a clonidine stimulation test was in the normal range (12.7 mg/L). The IGF-1 level was 47 ng/mL (normal values for age: 32–259 ng/mL).
Although short stature was disproportionate, diagnosis of NS was suspected, and genetic tests of the PTPN11 gene were requested. The entire coding regions and intron-exon boundaries of the PTPN11 gene were amplificated by polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA and sequence specific primers. Both forward and reverse strands were directly sequenced using an automatic DNA sequencer. The results confirmed NS because a c.922A>G (rs28933386) heterozygous mutation in exon 8 of the PTPN11 gene leading to a p.Asn308Asp substitution was identified (reference transcript NCBI NM_002834.3 and NP002825.3). This mutation has already been described as pathogenic by Siegfried et al. ().
Due to the presence of a mesomelic short stature, the concurrent presence of two genetic mutations was considered and a genetic evaluation of the SHOX gene was requested. A test of chromosomal microarray analysis performed with the CGH array led to the identification of a micro-duplication at the level of the region PAR 1 (Xp22.33/Yp11.32) extended about 680 kb involving the SHOX gene. The microduplication in the pseudoautosomal region PAR1 has already been described in NS and its clinical significance therefore appears to be certain ().
GH treatment (0.2 mg/kg/wk) was prescribed. At a follow-up assessment 18 months after the initiation of GH treatment (weight-appropriate dosage), the following data were collected: height, 109.8 cm (<2 SD); weight, 18 kg (<3° centile); growth velocity, 7 cm/year (>90° centile); arm span:height ratio, 96%; sitting height:height ratio: 56%. Further evaluations have been scheduled for every 6 months.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 40-year-old male with no past medical history was found unconscious by bystanders after he had been out for a recreational jog. Upon the arrival of medical services, the patient was found to be in VF cardiac arrest and required two shocks before the return of spontaneous circulation. The downtime was reported to be about 15 minutes. Per history obtained from family members, the patient had never experienced any cardiac symptoms such as palpitations or chest pain and had no COVID-19 symptoms.
The patient had no significant personal medical history, took no medications, and exercised regularly with no difficulties. Family history was notable for coronary artery disease (CAD) in his brother, which had been diagnosed at age 50, and myocardial infarction (MI) in his father at age 72. There was no family history of sudden cardiac death.
Given the patient’s young age and absence of underlying cardiac issues, the differentials for his VF arrest were broad. Etiologies considered included ischemic heart disease, structural heart diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, anomalous origin of coronary arteries, myocarditis, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, primary electrical abnormalities such as long QT syndrome, and Brugada syndrome, and non-cardiac etiologies such as a massive pulmonary embolism (PE).
A basic metabolic panel showed no significant electrolyte abnormalities. The initial troponin-T level was within normal limits. Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission showed normal sinus rhythm, non-specific T-wave changes in anteroseptal leads, and a QTc of 445 ms (Figure ). A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal LV systolic and diastolic functions with no valvular pathology or regional wall motion abnormalities. A chest CT with PE protocol showed no significant pulmonary emboli. Per institutional policy, the patient was tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) via nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which returned positive. A subsequent SARS-CoV-2 antibody test was also positive.
The patient was emergently intubated for airway protection and taken to the catheterization lab where coronary angiography showed non-obstructive proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery disease with 55-60% stenosis and flow distal to the lesion with Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score of 3. Left circumflex and right coronary arteries were disease-free (Figures , ). The left ventriculogram showed normal systolic function with no wall motion abnormalities. The patient was then admitted to the ICU for therapeutic hypothermia. He received convalescent plasma, remdesivir, and dexamethasone for his COVID-19 infection. During his ICU stay, he had one episode of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the setting of agitation and hypoxia that terminated spontaneously in less than three seconds. He continued to improve and was eventually extubated and discharged home.
Later on, an outpatient single-photon emission CT (SPECT) pharmacological myocardial perfusion scan showed no anterior ischemia or scar (Figure ). A subsequent cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging showed normal LV and RV sizes and functions with no late gadolinium enhancement. The patient eventually received a single-chamber VVI implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) for secondary prevention of VF. Subsequent outpatient genetic testing with INVITAE® Arrhythmia and Cardiomyopathy Comprehensive Panel (Invitae, San Francisco, CA) revealed no genetic variants known to cause arrhythmia. At the one- and four-month follow-ups, the patient remained asymptomatic and ICD interrogation revealed normal sinus rhythm with no episodes of arrhythmia.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

We gave non-invasive ventilation (CPAP) support with Fio2 80%, pressure support 14, and PEEP 7 (cm H2O). On the third day of CPAP therapy, the patient was unable to maintain oxygen saturation (SpO2 < 92%) despite FiO2 100% and became more tachypnic (RR > 40). There was increased respiratory distress and SpO2 decreased to <90% despite FiO2 100%. We gave supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula with O2 flow 10 L by another flowmeter (). The patient became more comfortable, and SpO2 increased to 95%. ABG showed PO2 90 mm Hg, PCO2 35, and SpO2 97%.

"A 73-year-old male, medical doctor, widower for 2 years, lives in the house with his two children. He is a social ethicist, smoker for 40 years, and quitted smoking 18 years ago as a response for the diagnosis of pulmonary emphysema, asthma, and systemic arterial hypertension (SAH). 10 years ago, he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. For the long-term asthmatic status, he uses formoterol fumarate dihydrate 200 mg with bisoprolol hemifumarate 1.25 mg daily (inhaled bronchial dilator) 1x daily; for systemic arterial hypertension, losartan and hydrochlorothiazide 50/12.5 mg (morning and afternoon); for dyslipidemia, rosuvastatin 20 mg, AAS 100 mg.
Two months after starting SC, the patient reported having an important hypoglycemic attack (glucose level of 27 mg/dl) (). 3 hours after starting this episode, this patient still presented dysarthria, mental confusion, and loss of consciousness and was hospitalized in the ICU with good recovery after glucose replacement. The use of SC was suspended during the hospitalization period, and the medication for diabetes was resumed. After dismissal from the hospital, SC was reintroduced at a dose of 25 mg 3 times per day, and postprandial glucose remained around 138 mg/dl, even when consuming sweets; sulfonylurea (gliclazide) has been discontinued and home glycemia ranged from 101 to 117 mg/dl.

"A 58-year-old female patient, who was a known case of hypertension and hypothyroidism taking tablet L-thyroxine 50 mcg once a day and tablet metoprolol 25 mg twice a day regularly presented on 17th April 2020 with chief complaints of low-grade intermittent fever, generalized body ache, running nose and soreness of throat for last 3 days. Her reverse transcriptase by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 was done at Civil hospital, which returned positive. Her husband was also symptomatic for COVID-19 and was also tested positive. Both were admitted in Civil hospital on 19/4/2020. Her chest laboratory parameters including complete blood count and X-ray were normal []. She was treated with azithromycin 500 mg once a day for 3 days along with paracetamol 500 mg thrice daily apart from multivitamins. Patient became asymptomatic after 2 days. Her repeat RT-PCR for COVID-19 was done on 28th and 29th April 2020 which both returned negative after which she was discharged on 29th April 2020. Her husband had COVID-19 pneumonia for which he remained hospitalized in civil hospital for 23 days and was subsequently discharged on her regular medication for hypertension and hypothyroidism at home. She was asymptomatic for almost next 4 months.
On 17th August 2020, she again developed symptoms in form of intermittent 101°F fever, generalized body ache, dry cough, and throat pain. Her rapid antigen test (RAT) returned positive. Her husband was negative on this occasion. Patient needed rehospitalisation on 19th August 2020 where her RT PCR for COVID-19 also returned positive with cycle threshold (CT score) of 18 suggestive of high viral load, thus confirming a case of reinfection with COVID-19. Total antibody and immunoglobulin G antibody test for COVID-19 were negative suggestive of non-existent immunoglobulin memory from previous COVID-19 infection. Her inflammatory profile revealed CRP of 17.8 mg/L and IL-6 of 15.4 pg/ml with otherwise normal X-ray chest (shown below) and other reports. Patient was subsequently discharged after being afebrile for 5 days.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 62-year-old, white, Caucasian, British-origin, male lorry driver was admitted to the hospital late on a Friday night after an unwitnessed single vehicle road accident. His lorry was by the side of the road and he was found unconscious in the vehicle and immediately transferred to the local District General Hospital. On admission, he had already fully recovered, being alert and orientated but he had no recollection of the accident. He was haemodynamically stable, with normal vital signs and no neurological deficit. He complained only at a moderate headache. Physical examination has revealed a bruise on the upper part of his left anterior chest wall, left shoulder and forehead. The rest of the examination was entirely normal. The radiological investigation that followed included cervical spine and left arm X-rays in which no fracture was noted. A mobile AP chest X-ray was also done on admission, in which it was demonstrated a dilated aortic arch (). A subarachnoid hemorrhage was found on a moderate quality brain CT-scan (), which was attributed to traumatic brain injury and the patient was transferred to the regional Neurosurgical centre as a post-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage for observation. During the next two days, the patient was well without any neurological defect and he has been gradually mobilized without any major complaint. On Monday however, brain CT interpretation by a more senior member of the medical staff suggested that this may not be a post-traumatic but rather an aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A CT angiogram confirmed that his SAH was of aneurismal origin, due to the rupture of an anterior communicating artery (Acom) aneurysm () which was the actual reason for his accident. As the patient was neurologically intact and stable, an embolisation procedure for endovascular treatment of this aneurysm was decided for the following day (day 5 since the SAH event). Under general anesthesia, the right common femoral artery was punctured and a 6F appropriate vascular sheath was placed following our protocol for endovascular procedures. During the first attempt to catheterize the aortic arch for the standard pre-embolisation angiogram, an unusual dilatation of the thoracic descending aorta was noted, just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. The combination of these findings with the bruise in the upper left chest, made us suspicious of an aortic injury. The embolisation procedure was abandoned and an aortogram revealed an aortic dissection just distal to the left subclavian origin (). The patient was woken up and a chest CT followed, which confirmed the diagnosis of a post-traumatic dissection of the descending aorta. Subsequently, he was transferred to the cardio-thoracic unit and an aortic stent was successfully deployed for endovascular repair of the dissection (). He had an uneventful recovery and two weeks later, endovascular treatment of his Acom aneurysm was performed with platinum coils (). At the same time, a posttraumatic dissection aneurysm of the right common carotid artery (CCA) at its cervical segment was also found (). This was clinically silent, treated conservatively at that stage [] and the patient was eventually discharged three weeks after the primary event. At the six month follow-up, the patient had made a very good recovery and returned to full activities. The aortic dissection was not visible anymore in imaging but there was a recurrence of the previous coiled Acom aneurysm due to coil compaction. Thus, a new embolisation procedure with platinum coils was performed to treat this aneurysm recurrence. At the same stage, the right CCA dissection aneurysm was endovascularly treated using platinum coils, as it showed no signs of regression [,].","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 69-year-old male patient presented with stuporous mentality after fall from 2-meter height. On admission, the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 7/15. Neurological exam revealed no further abnormalities. Brain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an ICH in the left temporal lobe with diffuse SAH and subdural hemorrhage (). A brain CT angiography revealed a pseudoaneurysm of MMA (). Sequentially, the patient was submitted to cerebral angiography and the left external carotid angiogram revealed a pseudoaneurysm arisen from the anterior branch of the MMA accompanied by dAVF at the middle segment of sphenoid ridge (). Through the right common femoral artery, a guiding catheter (Envoy 6 Fr; Cordis/Johnson & Johnson, Miami, FL, USA) was positioned in the left external carotid artery. We carefully naviated a microcatheter pre-shaped 45 degrees (Excelsior SL-10; Stryker Neurovascular, Fremont, CA, USA) under the guidance of a 0.014-inch microguidewire (Synchro 14; Stryker Neurovascular) to reach the juxtaproximal to the pseudoaneurysm via MMA. After the confirmation of the appropriate position of the microcatheter via repetitive superselective angiography (), embolization of a pseudoaneurysm and MMA was performed using 25% n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) (Hystoacryl; B. Braun, Melsnagen, Germany) mixed with iodized oil (Lipiodol; Guerbet, Aulnay-sous-Boid, France). We achieved angiographically complete occlusion of a pseudoaneurysm and dural AVF (). Follow-up brain CT scan showed no significant hematoma enlargement and well penetrated glue cast at the all the vascular lesions ().
The patient presented an improvement in consciousness for GCS score 15 after 12 days. However, at the 18-day after the procedure, the right side weakness and dysarthria were developed. Brain CT angiography and subsequent left internal carotid angiography revealed cerebral vasospasm at the distal segment of MCA with multiple low densitied at the left MCA territories (). Cerebral vasospasm was treated using intra-arterial (IA) nimodipin infusion, and it was improved. At discharge, dysarthria was improved, but right side weakness was remained (Grade 3).","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 42-year-old man with no past significant medical illness presented with headache. CT scan done showed subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) predominantly in the perimesencephalic cisterns []. Magnetic resonance imaging T1 gradient sequence also showed the hypointense signal suggestive of blood products in the perimesencephalic cisterns []. Fetal posterior cerebral arteries are seen on both the sides arising from the internal carotid artery [Figures and ]. DSA (digital subtraction angiogram) done subsequently revealed fusiform bulbous dilation involving both the cisternal and cortical segments of the left SCA []. Endovascular treatment in the form of parent artery occlusion was done under general anesthesia, with complete exclusion of the aneurysm from the circulation as seen on post-coiling angiogram []. Standard heparin protocol was followed and activated clotting time greater than 250 s was maintained during the procedure. Six-French (6F) Envoy (cordis) guiding catheter was placed in the distal vertebral artery. A combination of echelon-10 microcatheter (ev3) and transcend 0.014 microwire (Stryker) were used to access the aneurysms. Multiple Axium (ev3) coils were used to occlude the aneurysm. There were no intra- and periprocedural complications and patient was discharged on the 5th day after operation. The post-operative course was uneventful. The patient's neurological examination after 1 month was completely normal.

"A 64-year-old man, who had a history of hypertension, presented with headache and vomiting. CT scan showed SAH in the superior cerebellar cisterns []. DSA done revealed a fusiform aneurysm of the distal SCA, predominantly involving the branch of the cortical segment [Figures and ]. Standard heparin protocol was followed and an activated clotting time greater than 250 s was maintained during the procedure. 5F Envoy (cordis) guiding catheter was inserted in the distal vertebral artery. The aneurysm was accessed with a combination of micro-catheter (echelon-10) and micro-wire (traxcess12). Meticulous pre-shaping of the micro-catheter according to the shape of the target aneurysm aided in proper positioning of the micro-catheter in the aneurysm which was subsequently packed densely with the platinum micro-coils. Post-procedure angiogram showed complete exclusion of the aneurysm along with the branch of the cortical segment and preservation of the flow in the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) []. There were no untoward events in the post-procedure hospital stay and patient was discharged after 1 week. No neurological deficit was seen during the clinical follow-up after 1 month.

"A three-year-old male child was admitted to the pediatric ward of Dr. Ruth KM Pfau, Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK) with a one-year history of generalized weakness, loose motions, decreased appetite and intermittent fever not associated with rigors, chills or night sweats, an eight-month history of inability to walk and sit, polydipsia, polyurea, abdominal distention and loss of neck holding for 14 days. He had a previous history of hospitalization six months ago due to the same complaints. The patient was accompanied by his mother. He weighed 6 kg, is the 7th born child to his parents and was delivered at term to a 37-year-old G7P7 mother via normal vaginal delivery. The mother did not report any complications or illnesses during pregnancy. He cried immediately after birth, and there were no complications during or after birth. There is no consanguinity between mother and father. The child was vaccinated but was malnourished, with an unremarkable family history.
The patient also developed diarrhea which was bulky in consistency, green in color with seven episodes per day after every meal intake. Diarrhea was associated with abdominal distention and vomiting. The mother then started giving him a combination of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, after which diarrhea subsided. The child developed neck holding at four years of age, he started sitting at eight months and started walking with support at 12 months of age. The child was first breastfed within three hours of delivery and was exclusively breastfed up to six months. Complimentary feeding was started after six months with pulses, mashed potatoes, porridge and chicken. Breastfeeding was continued up to two years. Currently, the child takes 1-2 feeds per day. The personal history revealed that the patient was sleeping normally, but the appetite was decreased. The mother also noticed a weight loss, altered bowel habits, and micturition was normal.
On examination (O/E), the patient was lying on the bed irritated, severely wasted and emaciated with visible bony deformities. Initial vitals included blood pressure (BP) 110/70 mmHg, a regular pulse of 90 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and a low-grade fever of 100° F. The patient was anemic and dehydrated, while, there was no presence of edema, clubbing, cyanosis, and lymphadenopathy. On further examination, parietal and frontal bossing, rachitic rosary (Figure ), widening of wrists and knock knees (it's a valgus deformity in which legs curve inwards so that the feet are apart when the knees are touching) were found as well. On abdominal examination, it was soft, non-tender, distended with mild tenderness on both flank regions, with a centrally placed umbilicus. The liver was palpable three fingers below the right costal margin. Gut sounds were audible 3-4 sounds/min. All other systems were unremarkable.
The anthropometric measures of the child are as follows: weight = 6.5 kg, occipitofrontal circumference = 49.5 cm, height = 72.5 cm, mid-upper arm circumference = 8 cm, upper segment = 45 cm, lower segment = 27.5 cm, weight for height = 6.5/9 *100 = 72.2 (moderately low) and height for age = 72.5/94.6*100 = 76.6 (severely low).
On investigations performed, complete blood count (CBC) showed a hemoglobin (Hb) of 5.4 gm/dl, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 82 fl and a platelet count of 187,000/mL. The total leukocyte count (TLC) was 10.6 x 109/L, including 39% neutrophils and 48% lymphocytes. His inflammatory markers were raised with a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 23 mg/L [Normal (N) = 3] and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 115 mm/hr (N = 0-22) for men and (N = 0-29) for women. The clotting profile showed an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.01, while prothrombin time (PT) was 10.6 seconds.
The urea creatinine electrolytes (UCE) were within normal range except decreased potassium levels of 2.8 mEq/L. The levels of calcium, magnesium and phosphate in blood were 15.1, 1.9 and 4 mg/dL, respectively. The blood culture showed a growth of Burkholderia species. The urinalysis showed a pH of 5.0, specific gravity of 1.025, with the presence of protein and blood. Additionally, numerous red cells were seen along with yeast and 4-6 pus cells per high power field (HPF). The urine culture showed growth of Candida species. The stool analysis showed that the stool was hard, acidic, brown in color with 1-2 pus cells per HPF. His vitamin D levels came out to be 54.29 ng/mL, and parathyroid levels were 8.36 pg/ml. Liver function tests showed a total bilirubin of 0.28 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 0.21 mg/dL and levels of alkaline phosphate alanine aminotransferase were 368 and 3 units per liter, respectively.
The X-rays of the chest (Figure ), skull (Figure ) and femur (Figure ) are attached below. Additionally, ultrasound of kidney ureters and bladder (KUB) showed an incidental finding of bilateral renal calculi (right kidney at lower pole measuring 0.7 cm, in the left kidney at mid pole measuring 0.7 cm), along with bilateral grade 2 renal parenchymal changes. The urinary bladder was normal in thickness with no presence of focal mass, calculus or diverticulum.
Considering the diagnosis of OI, an ophthalmology review was done to look for lens dislocation and blue sclera, but neither was present in both eyes. However, the left eye showed a corneal thinning nasally, temporally and inferiorly.
During the hospital stay, the patient was intravenously given cefotaxime 220 mg, piperacillin-tazobactam 700 mg, and meropenem three times a day. Additionally, linezolid 70 mg was injected every eight hours, along with injections of bisphosphonate 7 mg for three days, amikacin 55 mg twice a day for 14 days and fluconazole 85 mg loading dose, 45 mg once a day for 10 days. The patient was also given a teaspoon of the combination (artemether and lumefantrine) once a day. Three pints of red blood cells were transfused as well, after which his Hb became 10.6 mg/dL. During the stay, the child had a prolonged course of fever with pancytopenia, which improved on injections of meropenem, amikacin, and fluconazole.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 46-year-old male visited the emergency department of our hospital on April 23, 2015 due to fever and headache for three days and impaired memory for half a day. The patient had experienced fever three days before, with a peak body temperature of 38.5 °C. No other discomfort was described. He had visited other hospitals before and was diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection based on haematological findings. However, his condition did not improve after treatment with intravenous levofloxacin. Within a half a day, he developed impaired memory, concomitant with speech disturbance, poor response, no significant limb movements and convulsions before being referred to the emergency department of our hospital. The patient had no medical history. No histories of food and drug allergies were obtained. The patient denied any prior history of smoking, heavy drinking or drug abuse. On arrival, the initial physical examination revealed the following: body temperature 38.0 °C, pulse 100 beats/min, respirations 26 breaths/min, blood pressure 144/76 mmHg, delirium, speech disturbance, equal size and round shape of bilateral pupils with diameters of approximately 3.0 mm, sensitive to light reflex, basically normal cranial nerve examination, limb muscle strength Grade V, negative bilateral pathological signs, and no ataxia. The patient’s neck was soft, and there were no signs of meningeal irritation. No significant findings were found on the cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations. No skin rashes or bleeding sites were observed after examining the entire body. The laboratory test results were the following: haematology: white blood cells (WBC), 12.5 × 109/L, neutrophil percentage, 87.6%; C-reactive protein (CRP), 56 mg/L; procalcitonin (PCT), 2.8 ng/mL; and D-dimer, 3.2 μg/mL. A chemistry panel and screens for infectious diseases and cardiac markers were generally normal. No abnormal findings were observed on chest X-ray or electrocardiogram. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed a curved high-density mass at the left sylvian fissure area and an ischemic lesion of the left temporal lobe (Fig. ).
As an emergency diagnosis, massive cerebral infarction (probable atherosclerosis of the left internal carotid artery system) was considered, and intracranial infection could not be excluded; appropriate treatments included aspirin for anti-platelet aggregation, atorvastatin for lipid regulation and plaque stabilization, and cefuroxime and acyclovir for anti-infection.
The patient experienced aggravated unconsciousness after two hours of admission, and physical examination showed the following: lethargy, aphasia, equal size and round shape of bilateral pupils with diameters of approximately 3.0 mm, sensitive to light reflex, shallow right nasolabial folds, immobilization of right limbs upon orbital pressure, movable left limbs, positive right pathological signs and negative left pathological signs. Further revascularization therapy was considered, and the patient was immediately transferred to undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). On the way to the radiology department, the patient experienced further aggravation of unconsciousness and entered a light coma, concomitant with limb seizure, gazing to the left of bilateral eyes, equal size and round shape of bilateral pupils with diameters of approximately 2.0 mm, and disappearance of the light reflex. Appropriate treatments included midazolam for epilepsy, mannitol for dehydration and intracranial hypotension. After termination of the seizure, re-examination of the brain CT showed a curved high-density mass at the left sylvian fissure area and a massive low-density area in the left temporal lobe with many high-density plot areas scattered within it. CT images also showed compressed deformation of the left ventricle and a shift of the brain midline to the right (Fig. ). Considering that the patient developed haemorrhagic transformation, he was admitted to the emergency intensive care unit for further management.
Eighteen hours after admission, the patient experienced further aggravation of unconsciousness and entered a moderate coma, concomitant with high fever (body temperature 39.9 °C), bilateral pupils: left versus right = 5.0 mm versus 3.0 mm, respectively, disappearance of the light reflex, increased muscle tone of the right limbs, and positive pathological signs of bilateral limbs. The brain CT re-examination showed expansion of the bleeding area, with overt signs of brain herniation. The patient underwent emergency left frontal temporal craniotomy, removal of the intracranial hematoma and a decompressed craniotomy performed by neurosurgeons. The intraoperative findings were as follows: dark red appearance of the left temporal brain tissue, concomitant with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH); an ostomy of approximately 0.2 cm was created along the left temporal sulcus; a visible purple blood clot was observed, concomitant with surrounding contused brain tissues; and a large vascular embolization could be observed in the hematoma cavity. Approximately 10 mL of the hematoma and contused brain tissues were removed and sampled for pathological evaluation. Histopathological examination showed haemorrhage, oedema and inflammatory changes in brain tissues, neutrophil infiltration into the vascular walls and surrounding tissues, and microvascular purulent thrombosis (Figs. –). The patient was transferred to the neurologic intensive care unit for further treatment after the operation. During the course of the treatment, negative findings were found for Chlamydia pneumoniae, mycopsslasma, influenza, tuberculosis, the TORCH panel, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); the sputum culture was negative, and the blood culture suggested Staphylococcus aureus. No abnormal findings were found on chest X-ray or ultrasound. In addition, two transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) examinations were normal, and there were no observations of valvular dysfunction or neoplasm. The following final diagnosis was considered: massive cerebral infarction, consistent with haemorrhagic transformation (the left internal carotid artery system, inflammatory thrombus), Staphylococcus aureus sepsis and symptomatic epilepsy. After two months of vancomycin anti-infective treatments and supportive and symptomatic treatment, the consciousness of the patient improved gradually, and several blood cultures were negative. He underwent rehabilitation and was discharged from the hospital on the 72nd postoperative day (POD). At discharge, his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was E4V4M6, and the modified Rankin scale score was 3.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 60-year-old male experienced dimmed vision in his left eye for 3 days prior to his first visit. The patient negated any other symptoms, including pain and diplopia. He had a history of two previous occurrences of possible ON – 30 years ago in his left eye and some 10 years later in his right eye. The patient had a history of hypertension and was currently on antihypertensive drugs. No relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) was present at his first examination. BCVA was 0.65 in the right eye and 0.5 in his left eye. A fundus examination revealed an atrophic and excavated disc in his right eye. An optic disc edema was present in his left eye. Retina was normal in both eyes. Laboratory tests for sarcoidosis, syphilis, and giant cell arteritis were analyzed, including determination of HGB, blood count, serum calcium, ESR, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), and Wassermann reaction (WR). All tests were normal or negative. Visual field and color vision were analyzed 3 days later; visual field test showed arcuate inferior defects in both eyes, with equivalent neural capacity of 67% in his right eye and 58% in his left eye. A Sahlgren’s saturation test (SST) color vision test revealed a more defective color vision in his left (20) than in his right (15) eye.
An orbital MRI carried out 1 week later revealed increased signal intensity in the parts of the left optical nerve sheath, possibly indicating OPN. The MRI also showed increased signaling in the retrobulbar fat of the left eye. No increased swelling of the extraocular muscles was evident.
The patient received a course of prednisone, 60 mg/day, which was tapered over 1 month, at which time he was examined again. BCVA was 1.0 in the right eye and 0.65 in his left eye. The optic disc edema had subsided substantially since the last fundus examination 1 month earlier. He received a new course of prednisone, starting with 25 mg/day, which was tapered to 7.5 mg/day until his next visit 2 months later. His BCVA was 1.0 in his right eye and 0.65 in his left eye.
Visual field testing again showed arcuate inferior defects in both eyes and abnormal thresholds, with equivalent neural capacity of 69% in his right eye and 61% in his left eye. A new MRI showed a slight regression of the enhancement around the left optical nerve since the last MRI. The results of a fundus examination revealed a pale papilla in both eyes. He remained on 7.5 mg/day prednisone, which was tapered over 14 weeks.

"The proband (II-2 in Fig. ) is a 45-year old woman, who first presented to our university hospital at the age of 35 and was referred to us because of her pregnancy. She has congenital deafness, first experienced syncope at the age of 3, and was diagnosed with epilepsy. She was treated with anti-epilepsy medications; however, she subsequently experienced several instances of syncope. At the age of 13, she had a syncope event, and was suspected of having JLNS because of her congenital deafness and prolonged QT interval. Her syncope was diagnosed as an arrhythmic episode when she was aware of tachycardia and as epilepsy when she was not. She also had a subarachnoid hemorrhage at the age of 29.
When she first presented at our hospital, she was not taking beta-blockers, because of a history of asthma, but was taking mexiletine in addition to phenytoin. Her QTc was found to be prolonged (584 ms) at presentation and administration of atenolol was initiated. She delivered her baby (III-1 in Fig. ) through Caesarean operation at our hospital at the age of 35. At 37, she delivered her second baby (III-2 in Fig. ) through Caesarean operation at our hospital. Despite administration of beta-blockers, her QTc remained prolonged (600 msec at the age of 37, 780 msec at 44) (Figs. and ), which is not unexpected because treatment with beta-blockers in LQTS1 is not expected to overtly reduce QTc []. However, she continued to experience occasional syncope and finally underwent an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) operation at 38 years of age. Subsequently, she is in a stable clinical condition. Because the proband was suspected of JLNS and both infants had a measured QTc of 500 ms or greater within 1 month after birth, beta blockers were initiated and both children remain in stable condition at ages 10 and 8 (Figs. and ). QTc of the son (III-1 in Fig. ) was measured as 500 ms one month after birth, while the QTc of his sister (III-2) was 530 ms at birth.
The father (I-1) and mother (I-2) of the proband were first cousins. There is no history of sudden unexplained syncope or death of children or adults in the immediate family members, despite the prolonged QTc of the children.
Clinical evaluation and consultation of the proband and her family members were performed at Chiba University Hospital. Clinical phenotypes were deduced from the clinical history, physical examinations, and ECG. Blood samples were collected from the proband and her family members following genetic counseling, and written informed consent was obtained prior to sample collection.
Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes according to established protocols at our laboratory []. Entire coding exons, including the intronic boundaries of the genes, of KCNQ1 (NCBI ref: NM_000218) and other LQT causative genes (KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNJ2, SCN4B, KCNJ5) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), according to established protocols in our laboratory. Briefly, 30–100 ng of genomic DNA was subjected to PCR amplification with DNA polymerase (PrimeSTAR GXL DNA Polymerase; Takara Bio Inc., Kusatsu, Japan) and primer sets.
The amplicons were subjected to conventional sequencing with Sanger sequencers (Applied Biosystems 3730/3130 DNA analyzers; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The sequence data were processed with Gene Codes Sequencher Software (Takara Bio Inc.) and mapped to the human genome sequence (build GRCh37/hg19).
Genetic analysis was performed to screen all coding exons and the exon–intron boundaries of the KCNQ1 gene (NCBI ref: NM_000218.2, NP_000209.2) with concurrent screening of other LQT causative genes (KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNJ2, SCN4B, KCNJ5). We detected a novel homozygous nonsense variant, NM_000218.2:c.115G > T (p.Glu39X, in exon 1a), in the KCNQ1 gene of the proband, as well as a homozygous common variant (NM_000218.2:c.1343C > G, p.Pro448Arg) (Additional file : Table S1). Genetic screening of her mother (I-2) and children (III-1 and III-2) revealed that they were heterozygous for the nonsense variant (Fig. ). Her husband (II-3) was also screened and found to be heterozygous for the common variant (NM_000218.2:c.1343C > G, p.Pro448Arg). The proband is a child from a first-cousin marriage, and we have concluded the homozygous nonsense variant in the proband is the cause of her JLNS1. The proband was negative for pathogenic variants in other LQT causative genes, including the KCNE1 gene (Additional file : Table S1).","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A female patient aged 60 years (with skin type III according to Fitzpatrick), with moderate chronic plaque psoriasis (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] =7.7), came to the dermatological clinic to receive phototherapy. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee at the University of Gothenburg and the National Data Inspection Board (approval number DNR:089–12, T285-16). The patient´s written informed consent was obtained for case details and publishing accompanying images. The patient was treated with NBUVB therapy (311 nm, according to standard protocol, 28 sessions, total dose 3.0 J/cm2 (increasing from 0.3 to 3.0 J/cm2) and psoriasis significantly improved (PASI =0.6). Four 4 mm punch biopsies were taken, one from intralesional psoriatic skin and one from perilesional healthy skin (about 2 cm from the psoriasis plaque) before and 24 hours after the last NBUVB session (). The biopsies were wrapped in aluminum foil and frozen at −70°C. Each sample was sectioned into 10 μm thin slices and placed on conductive glass slides. The whole process is illustrated in . The sections on the slides were used as they were for NLM and ToF-SIMS measurements; no treatment was done before the measurements. For histological assessment, the frozen sectioned slides were stained with H&E ().","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 69-year-old man was referred to our clinic in August, 2006 presenting with decreased visual acuity in his right eye. He had been diagnosed with CIMF in July, 2000 and continued to have supportive care for CIMF throughout his follow-up. He had no specific ocular history and no history of irradiation. Visual acuities were 20/25 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left. Slit lamp examination showed no abnormalities on the conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber and iris. Fundus examination disclosed a mild vitreous hemorrhage in the right eye (). The peripheral fundi of both eyes showed marked vessel occlusion and microaneurysms in the temporal area. Fluorescein angiography in both eyes showed arteriovenous anastomosis with a marked area of nonperfusion and multiple sea-fan neovascularization on both eyes (). On laboratory examination, hemoglobin was 4.9 g/dL, platelet count was 63,000/mm3, and white blood cell count was 2,500/mm3 (with no blast cells). A peripheral blood smear test showed teardrop-shaped red cells. His fasting blood sugar value was normal, and the hemoglobin electrophoresis study was negative. Bone marrow examination showed hypocellular marrow with severe fibrosis and osteosclerosis (cellularity 11-20%), and no Philadelphia chromosome or BCR/ABL gene rearrangement was found.
In view of these findings, photocoagulation of the peripheral avascular retina of the left eye and laser photocoagulation with pars plana vitrectomy of the right eye were performed. Intraoperative findings were mild vitreous hemorrhage with a diffuse traction membrane around the temporal avascular retina. The vitreous hemorrhage and traction membrane were removed and laser photocoagulation was performed. Four weeks after surgery, his visual acuities were 20/25 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left, fundus examination of the right eye revealed no vitreous hemorrhage, and the retinal neovascularization had regressed in both eyes with good laser scars ().","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"Patient (1) is a 3 years old female, the second in order of birth of a first cousin marriage (Figures and ). She was referred to the genetic clinic at the age of one year with a provisional diagnosis of congenital Rubella syndrome. At presentation she had jaundice of one week duration, her length was 71.5 cm (less than - 4 SD), weight was 7 Kg (less than - 4 SD), and skull circumference was 39 cm (microcephalic). She had global developmental delay (that progressed in the next years), enophthalmia with characteristic physical appearance and cutaneous photosensitivity. Abdominal examination revealed an enlarged liver (8 cm below the costal margin) firm in consistency, with rounded border and smooth surface. She had moderate ascites with bilateral shifting dullness and bilateral lower limb oedema.
ALT was 94 IU/L (normal: 37), AST: 143 IU/L (normal: 40), total bilirubin: 5.9 mg/dl, direct bilirubin: 5 mg/dl, albumin: 1.5 g/dl. Prothrombin time (PT) was prolonged with INR: 1.7. Hepatitis A virus IgM, HBsAg, HBcAb IgM, hepatitis C virus antibodies were negative; CMV, EBV and rubella (IgG and IgM) were also negative. Plasma aminoacids revealed a mild elevation of methionine: 1.3 mg/dl (normal < 0.8) and an elevation of methionine/phenylalanine ratio: 1.41 (normal < 1.0). Acylcarnitine profile was normal. Total galactose (galactose and galactose 1- phosphate combined): 1.7 mg/dl (normal <15). Galactose 1- phosphate uridyle transferase was: 71.2 uM (normal >60). DNA testing for galactosemia mutation revealed no copies of the Q188r, S135L, K285N, or L195P (classical galactosemia) or N314D (Duarte galactosemia).
Slit lamp examination revealed clear corneas and lens. Fundus examination showed pigments around the disc (bilateral retinal dystrophy). CT brain revealed central and cortical involutional brain changes. MRI brain revealed mild prominence of the brain sulci, fissures and basal cisterns with mildly dilated ventricular system more appreciated at the cerebellar hemispheres with mildly prominent cerebellar fissures. This is in addition to evidence of dysmyelinating process in the form of periventricular hyperintensity. Nerve conduction velocity and EMG showed normal studies.
The patient received ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day, vitamin E (100 mg/day), aldactone (2 mg/kg/day), vitamin K (10 mg/day) and albumin transfusion. She gradually improved over one month and was discharged from the hospital on aldactone (12.5 mg/12 hrs) and vitamin K (10 mg once daily). Her investigations on discharge were: total bilirubin: 3.6 mg/dl, direct bilirubin: 2.1 mg/dl, albumin: 4 g/dl, AST: 54 IU/L, ALT: 100 IU/L, and normal PT. After 2 months, the amino acid profile was repeated and revealed normal results.

"A 64-year-old woman experienced gradual visual loss for several months prior to her first examination. The woman had a 15-year history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In addition, she suffered from hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sleep apnea, and a sense of unsteadiness, which had worsened during the last months. She was on several medications (aspirin, omeprazole, simvastatin, atenolol, ramipril, amlodipine, albuterol inhalation, budenoside, and formoterol inhalation). She negated eye pain. BCVA was 0.8 in both eyes. Both visual fields exhibited temporal defects (Humphrey field test). A fundus examination showed peripapillary atrophy in both eyes, but no sign of edema. An MRI with and without intravenous contrast performed 1 week later revealed an increased volume of fluid surrounding both optical nerves as well as increased signal intensity in the optical nerve sheaths, as seen in OPN. The MRI also showed increased signaling in the retrobulbar fat of the left eye and possible subcortical vasculitis. At a consultation, 1 week after the first visit, BCVA was unchanged since the last visit. Laboratory testing was done for sarcoidosis (ACE), syphilis (WR, VDRL), and neuromyelitis optica (NMO). In addition, ESR, CRP, HGB, and blood count were determined. Results showed a high or abnormal ESR, serum lysozyme, polyclonal IgG, and creatinine. Results for NMO antibodies, syphilis, and sarcoidosis markers were normal or negative. A chest X-ray did not find any sign of sarcoidosis. However, a slightly enlarged heart was observed, suggesting a developing heart failure. The woman was later administered intravenous corticosteroids (1 g ×2) and cyclophosphamide to treat her SLE. Shortly after, the woman was hospitalized due to cardiac arrhythmia. Warfarin and digoxin were prescribed, and the woman was discharged from the hospital some days later. Because of her arrhythmia, future treatment with corticosteroids was restricted.
At a new examination 3 months after her first visit, BCVA was unchanged. Results from eye field tests were still abnormal, with no certain change since the last examination. An SST color vision test showed more defective color vision in the left eye (80 p), compared to the right (30 p). Fundus examination showed no optic disc edema in either eye.
At a new consultation 2 months later, BCVA was still unchanged at 0.8 in both eyes. She was on prednisone (5mg/day) in addition to methotrexate (5 mg/week) and levetiracetam, which had been prescribed since her last visit. A fundus examination revealed peripapillary atrophy, but no signs of disc edema in either the left or the right eye. Visual field tests were abnormal (Humphrey field test, VFI was 61% in right eye and 71% in left eye). One month later, she was given injections of rituximab.
At the final eye examination 10 months after her first visit, BCVA was 0.8/0.65. A slight improvement of visual test results was observed (Humphrey field test, VFI was 83% in right eye and 74% in left eye). As noted previously, color vision was more defective in the left eye (35 p) compared to the right (20 p), although some improvement was seen since the last examination.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 17-year-old female patient presented with a subcutaneous swelling on the flexor surface of the lower part of the left arm for last 3 weeks. The swelling was accompanied by mild pain. It was 2 cm × 2 cm, spherical in shape with well-defined margins. The swelling was freely mobile without any signs of acute inflammation. The patient did not reveal any other swelling in the body. Routine hematologic tests showed complete blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate within normal limits. Peripheral smear prepared from the patient's blood did not demonstrate any parasite. Absolute eosinophil count and eosinophil count were within normal limits (absolute eosinophil count 200/mm3, eosinophils 2%).
Clinical diagnosis of neurofibroma/lipoma was made by a treating physician and the patient was referred to the Department of Pathology for FNAC, which was done using a 10 mL syringe and a 22 gauge needle under aseptic precautions yielded pus. Aspirated material was spread on slides, air-dried, and stained with Giemsa stain and Ziehl-Neelsen stain for acid-fast bacilli.
Cytological examination of Giemsa-stained smear showed a large number of microfilaria in the background of degenerated inflammatory cells that comprised of neutrophils, eosinophils, histiocytes, and lymphocytes. The microfilaria had typical features of the presence of hyaline sheath, cephalic space, and tail end devoid of nuclei. Thus, these Wuchereria belonged to the species bancrofti [].
Ziehl-Neelsen staining did not show any acid-fast bacilli.
The patient was treated with diethylcarbamazine [100 mg ter die sumendum (TDS)] for 21 days and kept on follow-up. The swelling subsided by the end of the 3rd week.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 45-year-old male patient underwent partial penectomy and distal urethrostomy for erythroplasia of Queyrat (i.e. carcinoma in situ of squamous cell carcinoma) in 2008. Since he was extremely dissatisfied with the remaining penile stump, he consulted our center about the option of phallic reconstruction. On June 14, 2010, phallic reconstruction was performed. The native urethra was lengthened by means of a radial forearm free flap. The phallus was reconstructed with an anterolateral thigh flap. The urethra was positioned inside the phallus according to the ‘tube-in-a-tube’ principle. In October 2012, the patient presented with obstructive voiding symptoms. A diagnostic urethroscopy showed a suspicious lesion in the remaining native, bulbar urethra, and biopsy confirmed the recurrence of a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the urethra. On December 13, 2012, he underwent excision of the remaining native, bulbar urethra with the creation of a perineal urethrostomy at the membranous urethra. The perineal urethrostomy was performed using the technique as described by Blandy et al. []. Unfortunately, the postoperative period was complicated by bleeding, wound dehiscence and infection (fig. ). Finally, the perineal urethrostomy became completely obliterated and a suprapubic catheter was placed (fig. ). As the patient accepted this only as a temporary solution, we proposed the revision of the perineal urethrostomy using a meshed split-thickness skin graft. This procedure was performed on April 23, 2013. The patient was placed in the lithotomy position and a midline perineal incision was made. Dissection was continued up to the level of the urogenital diaphragm. A flexible cystoscope was inserted along the suprapubic tract and brought through the bladder neck into the posterior urethra. This marked the place of obliteration as the light of the cystoscope could be seen through the perineal incision. The urethra was opened on the tip of the cystoscope. All fibrotic tissue was further excised until only healthy urethral mucosa remained. The urethral stump was spatulated over 1.5 cm. Vicryl 4.0 stay sutures were placed at the mucosa to facilitate identification and to prepare the anastomosis for the graft (fig. ). A split-thickness graft (10 × 15 cm) was harvested from the skin of the left thigh and meshed 1:1. In the middle of the graft, an opening was made to anastomose with the urethral opening. The edges of the graft were further tailored and anastomosed with the perineal skin edges. Several additional quilting sutures were placed to fix the graft against the perineal graft bed (fig. ). A compressive dressing and a 20-Fr urethral catheter were left in place for 5 days. After 5 days, the dressing was removed with satisfactory graft take. Subsequently, the catheter was also removed. At present (6 months of follow-up), the patient is voiding well. Maximum and average urinary flow are 22 and 13 ml/s, respectively. His International Prostate Symptom score is 5/35. The perineal wound has healed well, with minimal contraction of the grafted area (fig. ). Through the neomeatus, a 20-Fr catheter can be passed without any difficulties, indicating a sufficient diameter.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 24-year-old man riding a motorcycle collided with a car while turning to the right. He fell off the motorcycle after the collision, and was injured by another car. He had no previous medical history. When he was brought to our emergency department in an ambulance, his airway was patent, he was tachypneic, hypotensive, tachycardic, and his Glasgow coma scale score was 7 (E1V2M4). Intubation, bilateral chest drainage, and blood transfusion were performed. Following assessment by whole-body computed tomography (CT), he was diagnosed with bilateral pneumothorax, liver and spleen injuries, fractures of the left acetabulum, right patella and tibial plateau, with open fractures of the shaft of the right femur and distal third of the left femur (Fig. ). External fixation and irrigation of both thighs were performed in the operating room. The liver and spleen injuries were treated conservatively. After surgery, his consciousness disorder persisted. Initially, hypoxia was not accompanied by significant changes in chest radiographs; however, serial chest radiographs showed progressive bilateral pulmonary opacities consistent with ARDS (Fig. A and B). Contrast-enhanced CT also showed bilateral patchy gland glass opacity and consolidation matching chest radiographs, and there was no filling defect in pulmonary artery. Arterial blood gases on the 4th day of admission showed a PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio of 100 mmHg under 10 cm H2O of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). In addition, the patient developed subconjunctival, abdominal, and precordial petechiae (Fig. ). He remained tachycardic, febrile with a body temperature >38°C, and was jaundiced. Laboratory data showed exacerbation of anemia (hemoglobin, 9.1 × 10 g/L), decreased platelet count (88 × 109 /L), and elevated total bilirubin levels (8.9 × 10 μmol/ L). Gurd and Wilson criteria (3 major and 5 minor criteria) and Schonfeld scoring system were used for the diagnosis of FES. The criteria of both scoring systems were met, thereby supporting the positive diagnosis of FES (Table ).[
The patient had type 1 respiratory failure which gradually worsened with conventional lung-protective ventilation. Due to a persistent consciousness disorder, prophylactic antiepileptic drug administration, anticerebral edema therapy, and targeted temperature management using an intravascular temperature control catheter were performed.[ On the 6th day of admission, the Murray score was 3.5 indicating severe lung injury: P/F ratio of 81 mmHg (4 points), pulmonary edema in all lung fields on chest X-ray (4 points), PEEP of 14 cm H2O (3 points), compliance of 23.3 ml/cm H2O (3 points). Because his cardiac function was not reduced and hemodynamic status was maintained, we chose VV-ECMO over venoarterial-ECMO.[ A 23 French multi-stage drainage cannula was inserted from the left femoral vein to the inferior vena cava, and a 17 French single-stage return cannula was cannulated from the right internal jugular vein to the superior vena cava. The ECMO rotation speed was 3300 r/minute and the flow rate was 4.5 L/minute with 100%FiO2 and 4.5 L/minute sweep gas flow. Under the condition, his peripheral oxygen saturation was maintained >95% and blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.42, PO2 of 95 mmHg, and PCO2 of 46.6 mmHg. Although lung protection management was continued with high PEEP and low tidal volume after VV-ECMO introduction, improvement in respiratory condition was not observed. Therefore, we decided to convert the external fixation to internal fixation to begin prone position therapy. Osteosynthesis was performed on the 9th day of admission under VV-ECMO. In the supine position a tourniquet was applied on the left side. The lateral parapatellar approach was used to reduce the fracture and fix the screws and lateral locking plate (Fig. A). The tourniquet was released to place the screws in the proximal holes of the plate, following which there was continued congestive bleeding. Heparin had been introduced into the circuit at the beginning of the operation, but due to a large amount of blood loss, protamine sulfate, an antagonist for heparin, was administered midoperation. The bleeding was controlled by closing the left knee wound and inserting a drain. Osteosynthesis of the right femur was then performed using a retrograde intramedullary nail (Fig. B) without any serious complications. The total operation time was 4 hours and 29 minutes and the total blood loss amounted to 3800 g. Sixteen units of red blood cell transfusion, 20 units of platelet transfusion, and 16 units of fresh frozen plasma were needed. The ECMO circuit was run heparin free for 2 days postsurgery.
Prone-position ventilation was initiated on the second day postsurgery after the hemodynamics became stable. The patient was placed in the prone position for 16 hours a day. Low tidal volume ventilation (6 ml/kg) and an infusion of neuromuscular blockade was introduced. To address severe acute kidney injury due to hemolysis, we also started continuous renal replacement therapy on the 14th day. For 4 days, the patient was managed in the prone position. His respiratory condition and chest radiographs improved steadily over the 8 days following osteosynthesis, and VV-ECMO was discontinued on the 17th day (Fig. C). The ventilator was removed on the 28th day. At that time, his respiratory status improved to P/F ratio: 370, and multiple petechiae disappeared. His conscious level normalized without residual central nervous system complications.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 29-year-old never smoker male patient was referred to the Pulmonary Medicine Outpatient Clinic for evaluation of possible drug resistant TB. The patient had received more than 1 year of anti-TB medications with no symptomatic improvement. Patient history and records were reviewed.
Two years ago, the patient developed insidious onset right sided pleuritic chest pain associated with a dry cough. It was associated with on and off fever with evening rise of temperature. There was a history of intermittent wheezing without any seasonal worsening and patient had noted 3–4 episodes of streaky hemoptysis. There was no history of anorexia or weight loss. The patient was evaluated at a local health care facility wherein based on the findings of a right sided chest radiographic opacity and thoracic ultrasound demonstrating mild right side pleural effusion, a possibility of pleuro-pulmonary TB was considered, and four-drug anti-TB treatment (directly observed treatment regimen) with first-line drugs was initiated. The patient was reassessed after initial regimen, but there was no radiological response. Sputum smear examination for acid-fast bacilli was negative on multiple occasions. Despite 12 months of regular treatment, there was no improvement in symptoms and cough persisted. The patient was initiated on treatment with an intensified anti-TB regimen (Cat II drugs administered on daily basis for 9 months) along with streptomycin and referred to our center.
General physical examination was normal. On chest examination, crackles were audible in the right infrascapular area, and breath sounds were reduced in the lower right hemithorax. Routine blood investigations were normal. Sputum cytology was negative for malignant cells. A thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan followed by flexible bronchoscopy was planned.
Contrast-enhanced CT thorax demonstrated a mass lesion measuring 5 cm × 7.5 cm × 4.5 cm in relation to the bronchus intermedius causing its significant luminal compromise with resultant atelectasis and bronchiectatic changes in middle lobe and lower lobe of the right lung [Figure and ]. No significant mediastinal/axillary lymphadenopathy or pleural effusion was noted. Findings were suggestive of a primary endobronchial mass with parenchymal extension with post obstructive pneumonitis changes. Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy showed a lobulated endobronchial growth in proximal right intermediate bronchus completely occluding the middle and lower lobe []. Endobronchial biopsy showed a malignant neoplasm comprising squamoid cells and mucin-secreting cells showing mild to moderate cytological atypia. Few mucin-secreting cells were seen lining glandular structures and foci of extracellular mucin were noted []. Occasional mitotic figure was seen, and necrosis was absent. Immunohistochemistry revealed CK5 and CK7 positivity, whereas, CK-20, S-100, and SMA were negative. A diagnosis of MEC (low grade) was given. Positron emission tomography-CT scan showed no significant uptake apart from the right lung mass. The patient underwent right middle and lower lobectomy and his postoperative period was uneventful. The final histopathology report was consistent with the result of the bronchoscopic biopsy. Follow-up bronchoscopy performed after 1 year showed an intact suture line with no tumor recurrence.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"RF is a 66-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient had a HeartMate II LVAD placed 3 years prior to presentation for medically refractory heart failure. He was on warfarin and aspirin for his LVAD with goal INR of 1.5–2.0. He presented to the emergency department with light-headedness and hematochezia for several days. He had no prior history of GIB. His physical examination and vital signs were unremarkable. His INR was 2.8, creatinine was 2.3 mg/dl, and hemoglobin was 10.4 from baseline of 12 to 13 g/dl. His last screening colonoscopy was 4 years prior and was reportedly unremarkable. He was admitted for close monitoring, serial laboratory testing, and gastroenterology consultation. He underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealing a gastric ulcer with a clean base with no evidence of active bleeding. A colonoscopy revealed a likely malignant tumor in the cecum, diverticulosis, and nonbleeding colonic angiodysplastic lesions []. The cecal mass was biopsied; it appeared to be actively bleeding and uncontrollable endoscopically. These findings were relayed to the emergency general surgery team.
He was taken emergently to the operating room. A midline laparotomy was undertaken and he was found to have a cecal mass that was perforated into a retroperitoneal abscess. The right colon was mobilized to the hepatic flexure and the abscess cavity was debrided. A right colectomy was performed with a stapled side-to-side ileocolonic anastomosis. A drain was placed in the abscess cavity, fascia was closed, and the skin and subcutaneous tissues were packed with gauze.
Final pathology showed no evidence of malignancy. It revealed a transmural defect of 1.0 cm × 0.5 cm with organizing hematoma and acute on chronic inflammation. Cytomegalovirus testing was negative. There was focal re-epithelialization, thus making bleeding diverticulum a possible diagnosis.
The patient's postoperative course was complicated by prolonged ileus necessitating total parenteral nutrition and pelvic abscess that required percutaneous drain placement. The patient additionally had bacteremia and fungemia. The patient's postoperative complications eventually resolved, and he was discharged to home with home health.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 3-yr-old boy presented with abdominal pain was referred to our institution for the evaluation of a progressive bulge in his right abdomen that his mother had first noticed seven days previous on February 12, 2009. A biochemical evaluation revealed no significant abnormalities. Serum levels of tumoral markers (AFP, CA19-9, CA125 and CEA) were within reference limits. A physical exam revealed a mildly tender mass in the right hypochondrium extending to the epigastrium; however, two lesions were found after a dynamic computed tomography (). The primary lesion (8.5 × 4.3 cm) was located in the head of the pancreas and partly herniated into the abdominal wall. While the secondary lesion (1.8 × 2.1 cm) was in the left abdomen near the spleen and the tail of pancreas, and well demarcated from the surrounding structures, and no calcifications were evident within them (). They all showed well-defined margins and inhomogeneous attenuation due to the presence of cystic and solid areas, in the venous phase () and the delayed phase (), a continuous enhancement was observed with a parenchyma density that was higher than that of the arterial phase. In addition, a large and distorted vascular shadow () inside of the tumors in the arterial phase in the primary lesion. There was no radiological evidence of nodal or distant metastases; however, there was a local infiltration of the adjacent abdominal muscle that required a laparotomy.
Surgery revealed the primary lesion was firmly adhered to the adjacent omental and abdominal muscle; in addition, a local infiltration of the liver and stomach were also noted. The head of the pancreas was compressed and could be separated from the tumor due to well-defined margins. The bile duct, portal vein, and the inferior vena cava were also compressed but patent. The gross specimen showed a resected mass measuring 8 × 4 × 4 cm that was well circumscribed and solid with areas of necrosis and hemorrhaging. No calcifications were evident within the mass. The secondary lesion was also adhered to the adjacent omentum and spleen; however, it was well demarcated from the surrounding structures with no evidence of originating from the pancreas. A histopathological analysis revealed a resected mass measuring 3 × 4 × 3 cm, which was well encapsulated by omentum with no calcifications within the mass. The surgical resection was difficult due to the extensive nature of the tumor, but the two lesions were completely resected without the pancreas being damaged. In the final pathology report following surgery, the diagnosis of pancreatoblastoma was confirmed with histopathological results, and the secondary lesion histology and immunohistochemistry was consistent with the findings of the primary lesion ().
After surgery, the patient was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and epirubicin) regularly. At the time of this report, 18 months after complete tumor resection, the patient is currently in good condition and without radiological evidence of recurrent tumor or metastases () with normal levels of CA 125, CA 19-9 and AFP to date.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"We present the case of a 63-year-old female with prior percutaneous revascularizations after a single vein bypass graft to the left anterior descending artery, presented with Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Angina Grade III. Physical examination and laboratory were unremarkable. She had a history of known, severe, life-threatening anaphylactic reactions to previous iodinated dye usage leading to respiratory arrest requiring intubation (despite adequate prophylaxis with steroids and antihistamines). Given her prior history of anaphylactic reaction to iodinated contrast, progressive escalation of medical therapy without repeat angiography was recommended. However, the patient continued to experience a progressive decline in quality of life despite maximal medical therapy. Therefore, coronary and bypass graft angiography was recommended. Coronary and bypass graft angiography was performed using 24 cc of undiluted Gadodiamide (OMNISCAN) with a power injector (ACIST®) without any incidents or premedication. The patient’s coronary artery disease was essentially unchanged from her prior angiogram () and further intensification of anti-anginal therapy was recommended. Patient was monitored for 24 hours for arrhythmia and had repeat renal function in 24 hours and one-week post procedure, were within the normal limits.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 67-year-old female with NF1 presented with lumbago, cold sweats, and sudden onset weakness, which necessitated an emergency transfer to our institution. She had no significant past medical history, was negative for hypertension, and was on no regular medications. She was hypotensive (systolic blood pressure = 60 mmHg) and tachycardic on arrival. An abdominal contrast computed tomography (CT) scan showed a rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with communication between the aneurysm and the inferior vena cava (IVC) (Fig. a, b). The maximum dimensions of the ruptured AAA and IVC were 34 mm and 37 mm, respectively. The aortic rupture was located 7.5 cm distal to the renal artery and 2.5 cm proximal to the bifurcation of the aorta (Fig. c). Due to the difficulty of primarily closing the ruptured IVC, we planned an endovascular treatment to control the bleeding from the IVC by exclusion of the ruptured AAA. The diameter of normal proximal aorta was 16 mm, which was too narrow to place a normal Y-shaped graft. Moreover, there was insufficient time to prepare another stent in emergency. Therefore, we instead deployed an ENDURANTII (Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, CA, USA) iliac extension proximal to the terminal aorta that was long enough to insert three or more stents (Fig. d). As the bleeding from the AAA and the communication between the aneurysm and the IVC were not well controlled, we placed an EXCLUDER (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) cuff in the ENDURANTII iliac extension. Although a type IV endoleak was detected on angiography, the patient’s hemodynamics stabilized. We therefore decided to conclude the operation at this point and re-assess the endoleak in a few days.
An abdominal contrast CT performed 3 days after the operation showed a type Ib endoleak and injury to the distal abdominal aorta (Fig. a). This led to a redo-EVAR 4 days after operation. This included deploying an AFX (Endologix, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) graft, as well as an infrarenal cuff, as the AFX head did not fit exactly within the stent placed in the primary operation. We also performed coil embolization treatment of the left internal iliac artery aneurysm (Fig. b), which was identified initially (Fig. b). We confirmed no endoleak at the final angiography. An abdominal contrast CT performed 18 days after the primary operation showed two new sequential aneurysms of the LCA, which were not previously detected. Coil embolization was planned to address these new aneurysms.
Twenty-two days after primary operation, however, the patient presented with new onset nausea, left abdominal pain, and hypotension. Her systolic blood pressure was 50 mmHg. She was resuscitated and required vasopressor support. Laboratory tests, including leukocyte count and electrolytes, were normal. The serum C-reactive protein and D-dimer were elevated to 0.37 mg/dl (normal range 0.01–0.30) and 6.8 μg/ml (normal range 0.0–1.0), respectively. We considered potential bleeding from nearby arteries, including the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and lumbar artery [, ]. An abdominal contrast CT showed enlargement of LCA aneurysms and surrounding hematoma (Fig. a–c), establishing the diagnosis of rupture of the LCA aneurysms. Emergency exploratory surgery was performed.
We gained access through a midline abdominal incision. Active bleeding was encountered intraperitoneally and controlled with compression. As a result of the patient’s initial AAA rupture, residual hematoma was present, which extended along the entire left abdomen and retroperitoneum (Fig. a). In addition, the AAA stent endograft had resulted in a left laterally displaced aorta, narrowing our operative field. Due to her distorted anatomy, active bleeding, and clinical condition, we elected to perform a left hemicolectomy. We divided the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) 3 cm distal to the IMA root to not to injure the recently repaired aorta. We divided the colon at the rectosigmoid junction. Proximally, we divided the colon at the middle of the transverse colon (Fig. b). The mesentery was divided to include the LCA aneurysms. Given her clinical condition, we elected to not perform a colorectal anastomosis, but instead performed a Hartmann’s procedure with an end transverse colon colostomy. The surgery took 145 min, and the estimated blood loss was 4.5 L. Packed red blood cell transfusion volume was approximately 1.96 L, and fresh frozen plasma volume was 1.44 L.
In reviewing the specimens, a 2-cm aneurysmal sac and 1-cm aneurysmal sac were identified in the LCA. No thrombus was identified (Fig. a, b). No ischemic changes and no tumor were observed in the excised colon (Fig. c). Interestingly, fibrous tissue around the left colic artery stained positive for S-100 protein, suggesting that neurofibroma from NF1 might have been associated with the rupture of these aneurysms due to weakened integrity of the vascular walls (Fig. a–e). A follow-up abdominal CT showed no recurrence of the endoleak. The patient was discharged 37 days after the last operation without any other post-operative complications.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 58-year-old male patient presented with a rapidly growing mass at the right posterior chest wall for one month. Initially, the patient had found an egg-sized lump at his right posterior chest wall. The patient received acupuncture at an oriental medicine clinic 10 days before admission. The soft mass showed relative hardening and rapid growth after the acupuncture.
In the physical examination, an approximately 5-cm mass was palpable at the right posterior lateral chest wall around the inferior angle of the scapula. The mass was mild and tender, without heat or redness. The patient had no history of trauma and had played golf excessively for the last six months.
Chest radiograph showed no bony abnormality or lung infiltration. Chest computed tomography showed a heterogeneous cystic mass on the right chest wall. A magnetic resonance axial T1-weighted image showed a well-demarcated lenticular mass lesion located in the right subscapular region between the serratus anterior muscle and the thoracic rib cage ().
We first recommended sonographically guided aspiration; however, the patient refused to undergo this procedure because of the possibility of recurrence after aspiration and rapid growth of mass. Excision of the mass was performed under general anesthesia. The patient was placed in a left lateral decubitus position. The latissimus dorsi and serratus anterior muscle were dissected after an incision was made over the right subscapular area. A soft, movable scapulothoracic mass, which was loosely attached between the serratus anterior and the intercostal muscle, was observed.
A well-encapsulated cystic mass measuring 8×5×5 cm in size was excised. A hemorrhage occurred, which was suspected to be a result of acupuncture in an oriental medicine clinic (). A histopathologic examination showed a pseudocyst with a thickened fibrotic wall, which was filled with blood clots. Many lymphocyte proliferations were observed in the cystic wall without neoplastic cells ().
This patient's history included playing golf, pathological features, and radiological images; therefore, this patient was diagnosed with scapulothoracic bursitis. The patient recovered well after surgery. No chest wall pain was observed, and no recurrent mass was found at the 10-month follow-up. The patient still enjoys playing golf.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"An 18-year-old female patient reported to our department with the complaint of poor esthetic appearance due to missing upper and lower front teeth since 4 years and seeking prosthetic treatment. Patient gave no history of trauma and extractions in relation with the missing teeth. The patient reported that the teeth exfoliated due to loosening. The patient's medical history was not contributory. Family history revealed no such abnormality among other family members.
On intraoral examination [] the morphologic appearance and color of the permanent teeth were normal. In maxillary arch, the missing teeth were from right canine region to left canine region and in mandibular arch, all the incisors were missing. There was generalized grade II and grade III mobility. Oral hygiene was poor and there were plaque and calculus deposits in all the quadrants. Restorations were present in left maxillary first molar and mandibular second molar.
Panoramic radiograph [] revealed adequate enamel thickness on the cuspal tips of all the teeth. There was no root formation in most of the teeth while some of the teeth exhibited short, blunted and malformed roots of only a few millimeters with obliterated pulp chambers. The mandibular first left molar tooth had taurodontism like appearance. Well-defined periapical radiolucencies were present in association with the apex of the mandibular left first molar and right first and second molar.
Although the patient had attained her physical maturity and was ready for definitive dental treatment but her physical, financial and psychological situations were important to be considered in selecting the final treatment plan. The following treatment plan was formulated for the patient. Dietary and oral hygiene instructions were given to the patient and extraction of the teeth that were mobile was advised along with the rehabilitation of the missing teeth with prosthesis.
The right maxillary first molar tooth was extracted and sent to Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology. Clinical examination of the gross specimen [] revealed an intact tooth. The tooth crown was of normal dimensions measuring around 7.5 mm but the roots were short and measured about 6 mm. The specimen was sectioned mesiodistally into halves. The mesiodistally cut tooth surface showed total obliteration of pulp chambers with dentin. One half of the cut tooth specimen was decalcified in 10% nitric acid and processed for hematoxylin-eosin (H and E) staining. Other half of the cut tooth specimen was used for preparing ground section.
The ground section [Figure and ] showed normal crown outline with normal enamel covering. A thin layer of superficial mantle dentin appeared but the pulp chamber was totally obliterated by an unusual calcified material consisting of atypical tubular dentin and osteodentin covered by thin discontinuous layer of cementum. Normal dentinal tubule formation appeared to have been blocked and the new dentin so formed around obstacle, gave rise to the characteristic appearance of “lava flow around the boulder” [].
Histopathologic examination of the decalcified hematoxylin-eosin section [] showed total obliteration of pulp that was filled with tubular dentin, osteodentin and irregular, globular masses of dentin [Figure and ]. A cluster of odontoblasts was seen within the globular masses of dentin.
Based on the clinical, radiographic, gross features and histological examination of the ground section and decalcified section, diagnosis of dentin dysplasia type I was made.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 50-year-old Korean man presented with a keloid scar on his anterior chest wall, which had developed 1 year prior following trauma and had gradually enlarged beyond the original wound's boundaries. He complained about pain and itching sensations in the keloid scar. The keloid scar measured about 5 cm and was located on the sternal area; a cystic lesion with a pin-point-sized skin opening was present at the center of the keloid scar (Fig. A). The cystic lesion was absent before the traumatic event, and dermoscopic examination revealed an EC with a central skin opening (Fig. B). The patient was asked to choose which among the 2 treatment options to undergo: total excision of the scar tissue including the cyst or laser therapy for the keloid and cystic lesion; the patient chose the latter method. First, laser therapy using a 595-nm pulsed dye laser (Vbeam; Candela Corporation, Wayland, MA) with a 7-mm spot size at a fluency of 12 J/cm2 and a 20-ms pulse width was performed to manage the keloid scar. Adjacent, nonoverlapping laser pulses were applied to the entire surface of the keloid scar. Epidermal cooling was achieved using a cryogen spray cooling device, which had a spurt duration of 30 ms with a delay of 30 ms. These procedures were performed 3 times with 3-week intervals. Second, laser therapy using a carbon dioxide laser (Spectra SP carbon dioxide laser, 20 Hz, 250 μs pulse width, 17 mJ; Lutronic, Korea) to create multiple punctures, resulting in a 2 to 4 mm hole, was performed to manage the EC. Gentle pressure and squeezing led to the exudation of the cyst's internal contents through the hole, and the remaining visible cystic walls were cauterized using the carbon dioxide laser. We applied Steri-Strip skin closures (3 M, Maplewood, MN) to the wound without surgical sutures. There were no postoperative complications, such as infection or wound dehiscence. The EC healed completely following the carbon dioxide laser therapy. We performed 5 further pulsed dye laser cycles on the whole keloid scar (Fig. C and D). After completing the laser therapy, Mepiform dressing (Mölnlycke Health Care, Oakville, Ontario, Canada), which is a self-adherent soft silicone dressing designed for scar management, was used by the patient for 5 months (Fig. E and F). There were no EC recurrences or keloid overgrowth during the 2-year follow-up period, and the patient was satisfied with the final outcome (Fig. G).","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 28-year-old male presented at the Restorative dental clinic, University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Benin City, Nigeria with a discolored maxillary left central incisor (tooth #11) of 4 years duration [], patient could not remember what happened to the tooth, examination of the tooth revealed Ellis class I fracture on the mesial incisial edge of the tooth. However, there was no carious lesion on the tooth. Pulp sensibility test with electric pulp tester was not responsive, and periapical radiolucency was evident in the periapical radiograph. Root canal treatment was commenced on tooth #11 immediately, through an access cavity on the palatal surface of the tooth. The canal was irrigated with 0.9% saline and 2.5% sodium hypochlorite solution. Intracanal medicament (calcium hydroxide) was placed in the canal, and the access cavity was temporarily sealed with zinc oxide eugenol. Patient was given a 2 day appointment for determination of working length of the tooth since the working length was not determined during the initial visit because of time constrains and continuation of the root canal treatment. Patient showed up for his appointment, examination revealed that the tooth was asymptomatic, but there was a discharging sinus in the floor of the right nostril [].
A further history revealed that the patient had been under the care of an Otorhinolargngologist for about 2 years for the treatment of the discharging sinus that he had been on several antibiotics, which he could not remember their names. The temporary seal and intracanal medicament were removed and the canal was checked using paper points, pus was revealed in the canal. Canal was the irrigated with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite and 0.9% saline alternatively. The working length was established at 29 mm using radiographic method [].
Biomechanical preparation of the canal was done using the step back under copious irrigation. Non-setting calcium hydroxide dressing was placed in the canal as inter-appointment medicament and the patient was giving a 4 week appointment. Patient returned 4 weeks later symptom free and complete healing of the sinus in the floor of the right nostril. Canal was obturated with guttapercha using the cold lateral condensation technique []. Access was sealed with glass ionomer cement and the patient was given a 1 month review appointment. Review after 1 month showed that the patient was asymptomatic, and there was no sinus in the floor of the nose, Subsequent reviews at the 3 months and 6 months revealed no symptoms.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"The case we present here is about a 40-year-old man who was referred to our pain clinic with severe ischemic pain of right lower limb. The pain started gradually 10 months back and became very severe for the last 1 month. The intensity of pain was increasing in both the sitting and lying down positions and decreasing in a standing position. Many non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were tried earlier without much benefit. Over the last 1 month, the severity of the pain was so bad that the patient had to stand all the time and sitting or decubitus position was not tolerable even for 1 min. His sleep was so miserable that he had been taking small naps in that standing position leaning onto some support. He had carcinoma rectum for which he underwent abdominoperineal resection 8 years ago. There was history of smoking prior to that. After the surgery, he had been leading a near normal life driving auto rickshaw for a living until he developed the present problem. There were many gangrenous ulcers over his right thigh and leg. A computed tomography-angiogram was done previously that showed a thrombus in the right common iliac artery measuring about 9.5 cm extending up to the right superficial femoral artery with a near total occlusion of the lumen and poorly developed collaterals. He was scheduled for a conventional peripheral angiogram for deciding on the further plan. However, he could not lie down in the catheterization laboratory due to severe pain and was referred to our Department of Pain Management. We initially tried a conservative approach with a combination of oral pregabalin, diclofenac, paracetamol, and tramadol as per the standard dosage protocol for 2 days. When there was no satisfactory pain relief, we planned epidural analgesia. However, the problem here was the positioning. Patient was not able to tolerate either sitting or lateral decubitus position even for 1 min. He was somewhat comfortable only in the standing position. Considering the special situation, though not conventional, we decided to place the epidural catheter in that standing position. An intravenous line was started using an 18G venous cannula. Electrocardiogram, pulse oximeter, and non-invasive blood pressure monitors were connected. Patient was made to stand besides the operating table holding on to it for support. He was also supported by a technician from the front []. After painting and draping the back, L 4-5 inter-space was identified and local anesthesia was given with 2% lidocaine. Epidural space was engaged with 18G Tuohy needle using loss of resistance to air technique. The epidural catheter was carefully threaded and placed such that the length of the catheter was 5 cm in the epidural space. Catheter was gently aspirated to check for blood and cerebro-spinal fluid and was fixed after subcutaneous tunneling for about 5 cm []. Patient was reassured and gently placed on the operating table in the supine position. A quick test dose was given with 3 ml of 2% lidocaine with 15 mcg adrenaline confirming the epidural placement followed by a bolus of 10 ml of 1% lidocaine along with 1 ml of 7.5% sodium bicarbonate. The pain was relieved within 1 min and the vital signs were stable. Epidural infusion was maintained thereafter with a solution of 0.125% bupivacaine and dexmedetomidine 2 mcg/ml at the rate of 5 ml/h. Patient was very comfortable and slept peacefully. Next day peripheral angiogram was performed, which confirmed the findings of CT-angiogram. Balloon angioplasty was attempted after 2 days, but was not successful and an above knee amputation was performed subsequently. Epidural catheter was removed after 2 days and further pain control was achieved satisfactorily with oral medications.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A woman in her late 60s was transferred in July 2012 from her local hospital because of anemia of at least one and a half year duration. She had no relevant family history, but had been treated for diabetes type 2 and hypertension for decades and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation for a few years. She had suffered from recurrent urinary tract infections, several times with fever and once with verified urosepsis. A concrement had been removed from her right ureter a few months ago.
Her history of anemia started gradually with fatigue in 2010-11. Her hemoglobin (Hb) level was 8.9 g/dL in February 2011, as compared to 13.4 at the last known previous assessment in 2008. She had received an erythrocyte transfusion at her local hospital without any transfusion reaction or other problems, and she had already suffered several exacerbations of anemia during febrile infections. There was no history of acrocyanosis or Raynaud phenomena.
On admission, she was in good general condition and did not present any pathological findings by physical examination. In particular, there was no acrocyanosis, lymphadenopathy, or splenomegaly. Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasonography were unremarkable. Hb was 8.2 g/dL, leukocytes 7.8 × 109/L with normal differential count, platelets 263 × 109/L, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 99 fL, reticulocytes 88 × 109/L, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 11 mg/L. Serum levels of iron, transferrin, cobalamin, and folic acid as well as transferrin saturation were within the reference range, however, with elevated ferritin at 1257 μg/L. Genetic screening for hemochromatosis showed no HFE gene abnormalities. Concentrations of electrolytes, calcium, creatinine, and liver transaminases were normal. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated at 544 U/L, bilirubin elevated at 43 μmol/L, while haptoglobin was undetectable (less than 0.1 g/L). Her urine was negative for hemoglobin and protein. Serum albumin was 41 g/L with normal immunoglobulin levels (IgG 7.0 g/L, IgA 3.2 g/L, and IgM 0.69 g/L). Serum electrophoresis identified a small spike of monoclonal IgAλ. Free λ chains in serum were slightly elevated at 53 mg/L, however, with a κ/λ ratio within the reference range. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was strongly positive for C3d and negative for IgG, IgM, and IgA. CA titer at 4°C was 128. Serum erythropoietin was slightly elevated at 36 IU/L.
Based on these findings, she was diagnosed with CA-mediated AIHA. With a chronic course, no signs of malignancy so far, and no recent specific infection, this AIHA was further classified as primary CAD. A bone marrow trephine biopsy showed erythroid hyperplasia and small lymphocytic infiltrates interpreted as lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL). Flow cytometry in bone marrow aspirate revealed two small, clonal populations: one of B-lymphocytes that displayed a κ phenotype and the other one of λ positive plasma cells.
The further development in Hb and IgA levels is shown in . During the next couple of years, Hb ranged from 9.0 to 10.0 g/dL; she had only mild fatigue and no transfusion requirement. Management consisted of regular follow-up, avoidance of cold exposure, and prompt antibiotic therapy in case of febrile bacterial infection but no CAD-directed pharmacological therapy. By 2014, a second bone marrow biopsy showed erythroid hyperplasia and lymphoid infiltrates, now interpreted as probable CAD-associated LPD []. Flow cytometry in bone marrow aspirate again demonstrated 2 pathological clones of κ positive B-lymphocytes (approximately 5%) and λ positive plasma cells (0.7%), respectively.
Her condition remained stable until late spring 2016, when she deteriorated. Her fatigue worsened, her atrial fibrillation relapsed more frequently, and her Hb level declined to 8.5 g/dL. The reticulocyte count was now elevated at 191 × 109/L, LDH was 303 U/L, bilirubin 96 μmol/L, haptoglobin <0.1 g/L, while IgA had increased to 12.5 g/L and CA titer to 512. The DAT findings were unchanged. We decided to give her rituximab monotherapy [], four weekly doses of 375 mg/m2, which she received from August 2016. Hb rose to 12.5 g/dL by December 2016, while bilirubin and LDH normalized. Unexpectedly, however, her IgA level continued to increase from 12.5 g/L immediately before rituximab treatment to 19.6 g/L by January 2017.
From June 2017, Hb started again to decline and IgA continued to increase. In January 2018, she experienced severe lumbar pain after having removed snow from her courtyard, which can be heavy work in Norway. One month later, Hb was 9.5 g/dL, while the absolute reticulocyte count was 153 × 109/L and the levels of LDH, bilirubin, and haptoglobin had not changed significantly. The IgA level was 24.5 g/L and β2-microglobulin 3.5 mg/L. A new trephine biopsy showed hypercellular bone marrow affected by 20% infiltration of monoclonal, λ positive plasma cells, and some small lymphocytic infiltrates. A CT scan showed osteolytic lesions of the skull but no relevant pathological findings in her spine, pelvis, or femora. She was diagnosed with development of MM.
In February 2018, a local visiting hematologist initiated a cycle of melphalan and prednisolone. During the next couple of weeks, Hb declined further to 8.0 g/dL, however, without any neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Concomitantly, a rise in bilirubin and LDH was observed, and she was diagnosed with an exacerbation of CAD. Melphalan and prednisolone were discontinued after the first cycle.
Hoping to induce remission of both MM and CAD, we decided in March 2018 to offer her bortezomib-based therapy [] with the addition of dexamethasone and rituximab [, , ]. She received four cycles at four weeks' interval of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks), rituximab (375 mg/m2 once per treatment cycle), and dexamethasone (20 mg on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16). She tolerated this combination well; her Hb level increased from 8.0 g/dL to 13.6 g/dL following the first cycle and reached 14.4 g/dL after the second one. Bilirubin and LDH normalized within a couple of weeks, and reticulocyte count declined to the normal range (65 × 109/L). IgA had declined to 3.8 g/L by the start of the second cycle. Her back pain improved. Ten weeks after start of therapy, Hb was 13.2 g/L, bilirubin 7 μmol/L, LDH 247 U/L, haptoglobin 0.24 g/L, and CA titer 64. IgA remained in plateau at 3.9 g/L, while serum electrophoresis did not show any monoclonal spike. DAT was still positive for C3d.
The lymphoma pathologist in our group (U.R.) did a centralized, parallel review of all three bone marrow samples based on extensive experience with CAD-associated bone marrow pathology []. The 2012 biopsy shows, in addition to erythroid hyperplasia, intraparenchymatous, κ positive B-cell infiltrates consistent with CAD-associated LPD. There are scattered κ positive plasma cells, more of them near the lymphocytic infiltrates, and one distinct infiltrate of λ positive plasma cells. In the 2014 biopsy, the picture has not changed significantly. The trephine biopsy from February 2018 shows an IgAλ positive plasma cell population that has expanded, but IgMκ positive B-cell infiltrates can still be seen. In retrospect, therefore, all three biopsies show two clones; and in the 2018 sample, the CAD-associated IgMκ plasma cell population seems “hidden” among the expanding, myeloma-associated IgAλ plasma cells ().","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 13-year-old Oromo girl presented with a progressively increasing right-sided abdominal mass, low-grade intermittent fever, and a dull right upper abdominal pain of 3 years’ duration with no other associated symptoms. There were no known past illnesses and there was no family history of similar illness. She was given pain medications and antibiotics on various occasions but there was no improvement.
Her general appearance was not acutely sick looking. Her vital signs were within normal limits. The pertinent abnormal finding was right-sided abdominal mass with well-defined medial and inferior border extending to right subcostal region. Complete blood count (CBC), urine analysis, and organ function tests were all normal. Ultrasound and a computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a huge vascular suprarenal mass displacing her right kidney caudally; it measurements were 16 × 19 cm and it contained multiple internal calcifications. There were no enlarged regional nodes and no vascular invasion.
Laboratory tests for functional adrenal tumors including serum and 24-hour urine metanephrines were all normal.
A working diagnosis of huge nonfunctional adrenal tumor was made and our patient underwent exploratory surgery through a bilateral subcostal incision. The operative findings were a well-capsulated and highly vascularized mass arising from the superior aspect of her right kidney, which got a significant blood supply from the right lobe of the liver. The mass was successfully and completely resected and the specimen subjected to histopathology.
The histopathology report showed 18 × 15 × 12 cm white solid mass with necrotic center arising from right adrenal gland. There was a patternless proliferation of spindle cells and ovoid cells that had mild pleomorphic nuclei and focally hyalinized stroma containing blood vessels. Mitosis was seen infrequently. These findings were consistent with a SFT of the adrenal gland.
Our patient was followed-up for 3 months and is doing remarkable well and members of her family were very grateful.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 65-year-old woman with a history of hyperlipidemia had experienced headache and vomiting for 10 days before admission to another hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed enlargement of both lateral ventricles and a mass at the foramen of Monro. The patient was then referred to our hospital.
Neurological examination on admission to our hospital showed memory disturbance (Mini-Mental State Examination 20/30) and a wide-based gait disturbance. Computed tomography (CT) showed a 16 mm mildly hyperdense mass with no calcification at the foramen of Monro, and the mass was causing obstructive hydrocephalus. MRI revealed a well-delineated mass at the foramen of Monro with heterogeneous signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images; the mixed-signal core appeared as a popcorn-like lesion typical of cavernous angioma (Fig. ). Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted imaging revealed mild enhancement of the mass (Fig. ). There were no vascular abnormalities on CT angiography or CT venography. We considered a colloid cyst, central neurocytoma, subependymoma, ependymoma, low grade astrocytoma, and arteriovenous malformation as differential diagnosis; however, despite the unusual location of the mass, a diagnosis of intraventricular cavernous angioma was made because of its typical appearance on MRI.
We performed endoscope-assisted transcortical removal of the mass (Fig. ). The entry point was made using the StealthStation S7 navigation system (Medtronic Inc., Louisville, CO), and a flexible videoscope (VEF-V, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted. Intraoperative neuroendoscopic imaging revealed a reddish lobular mass with a hematoma and obstruction of the foramen of Monro. We observed the cavum septum pellucidum because of the high intracranial pressure associated with hydrocephalus. After right frontal mini-craniotomy, the Viewsite Brain Access System (Vycor Medical Inc., Boca Raton, FL) was inserted (Raza et al. ); we used the 17 mm wide retractor in the 7 cm length. Endoscope-assisted surgery with the Viewsite was performed with technique similar to microsurgery. A 2.7 mm rigid endoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) fixed by UniArm (Mitaka Kohki, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted. The working ambience was air because of its advantages over fluid ambience especially when dealing with a relatively vascularized pathology. Other microsurgical instruments were used parallel to the endoscope. The endoscope served only as an optic apparatus. We used the Viewsite as an access port to enable dual instrumentation (endoscope and microsurgical instrumentation). The tumor was bluntly dissected from the ventricle wall, and total en bloc resection of the lesion was performed by one surgeon using the two-handed technique. Bleeding was well controlled with irrigation and bipolar coagulation.
The resected tumor was reddish and consisted mainly of clotted blood vessels and xanthochromic tissue. Histological examination revealed a cavernous angioma with evidence of large vascular spaces filled with an organized thrombus (Fig. ).
Postoperative MRI confirmed complete removal of the tumor, and a return to normal ventricular size (Fig. ). The patient’s symptoms resolved immediately, and there were no postoperative complications. She was discharged without any neurological deficit. No complications or neurological impairment were observed at the 1-year follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"Sarah was 8 months old when she first came to our clinical unit with her family. Sarah had a severe visual impairment. Moreover, Sarah’s mother reported that she faced many challenges in trying to understand her daughter and interacting with her in a reciprocal satisfying way. The visual impairment of the infant was a great barrier for the mother, who reported feelings of sadness and inadequacy as a caregiver.
To support the mother in detecting communicative intent and participation in Sarah’s behavior during the interaction and to increase the opportunity for the dyad to perceive more pleasure in their relationship.
We videotaped the FFSF paradigm with Sarah and her mother. During the Play episode, Sarah demonstrated to be able to orient her attention to auditory stimuli (e.g., maternal voice), but the mother rarely interpreted and responded properly to her orientation as communicative signals. The mother was frequently silent producing few attempts to engage with Sarah and remaining physically distant. The mother used the pacifier any time Sarah displayed minimal distress. The interaction appeared to be very difficult and – according to maternal reports – not very satisfying. During the Still-Face episode Sarah stood relatively quiet, with very few movements of the arms and legs. Nonetheless, a few seconds after the Still-Face episode onset she started to protrude in the direction of the mother, producing a lot more vocalizations compared to the Play episode and showing increased distress and negative emotionality. As soon as the Reunion episode started, the mother resumed to interact with Sarah and said: “Oh, you’re here then!” During the reunion phase the mother appeared more active in the interaction with her daughter and, after a period of negativity (i.e., 3040 s), Sarah displayed a smile toward her mother.
During the consultation the Sarah’s mother immediately said that she had never seen Sarah being so communicative and that the observation procedure “literally opened a new window in our relationship.” Looking at Sarah’s response to the Still-Face episode further allowed the mother and the psychologist to identify specific communicative behaviors which were previously undetected by the mother (e.g., active requests of being picked up, attentional focus on the mother, and sensitivity to maternal lack of communications). Moreover, the mother acknowledged that Sarah was indeed interested in interacting with her even in the presence of visual impairment. This increased acknowledgment of Sarah’s availability and desire to interact, and was also an opportunity to set up a collaborative consultation on specific modalities to reach out to Sara and to achieve better emotional closeness and reciprocal satisfaction.
This clinical vignette suggests that the joint observation of FFSF promote in the Sarah’s mother some changes in mental representation of her own infant. In turn, it reflects on subtle modifications in the maternal interactive style during interaction with Sarah.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 62-year-old male, married, retired, with type 2 diabetes for more than 15 years, background to rheumatoid arthritis and myocardial revascularization, with no history of using alcohol or tobacco, without neuropathy, feeling pain in right foot which showed signs of dry necrosis in the plate and in the digital pulp of the third finger, and partial necrosis in the hallux reported. He Presented with distal pulses in the finger extremities, without fever, heartbeat of 80/min fc, and Pa 13 × 9 and was attended at the Diabetic Foot Treatment Center with diagnosis of type II diabetes and ischemic diabetic foot. He presented with progressive and painful necrotic plaques in the right hallux and 3rd right foot pod. The color of the feet was purple with fuming appearance. In terms of background, the patient reported treatment with a rheumatologist at the Hospital das Clínicas in São Paulo due to arthritis of the hands and coronary stent placement for 6 months at INCOR-SP. He was being medicated with prednisone, clopidogrel, and metformin.
After clinical evaluation, he was medicated with Cilostazol 50, and an arterial echo Doppler of the lower limbs was requested. This examination concluded that the arterial trunks had vascular patency with three-phase flow. There was a minor, noticeable improvement of the right toes after two months of treatment with Cilostazol but with worsening of the contralateral toes. There were fixed cyanosis and resting pain of the 3rd and 4th toes of the left foot. Even an intensive care treatment by photodynamic therapy (PDT) did not improve the condition of the diabetic foot []. After consulting his cardiologist to authorize the use of SC, this drug was administered at the daily dose of 50 mg. This treatment was maintained for 10 months, with remission of the endpoint ischemia. The patient reported feeling well, and PDT started to respond well. After 5 PDT sections, feet lesion healed and the patient regained his colored feet and reported no pain ().
One year after discharge, the patient returned again with lesion in his 1st left toe, ischemia in the 2nd right toe, with a necrotic plaque and ulcerated digital pulp, a lot of resting pain, and left lateral hallux ulcer. SC was once again administered, this time in doses of 50 mg every 12 hours (100 mg/day). After 3 months and 6 PDT sections, the 1st left toe had already healed, but the patient started to report hypoglycemia attacks. The use of Metformin and fasting was discontinued, as long as glucose levels were kept between 82 and 93 mg/dl, and SC was reduced again to 50 mg. The treatment of the 2nd finger, which was initially ulcerated, was finalized by PDT, and the patient was discharged.
During this relatively long period (more than two years), glycemia was obtained daily throughout several months, and average values are shown in . It is clear that SC allowed for a reduction and stabilization of glycemic values, with the extra benefit of having improved also the microvasculature, as indicated by the cure of the diabetic foot. It is also possible to note that there is an effect of the dose of SC, since during the 100 mg/day period, glycemia was significantly lower than in the other three periods in which the patient received a SC dose of 50 mg/day. However, as mentioned above, patient 1 under 100 mg/day of SC had an important hypoglycemic event, which was not observed at the 50 mg/day dose.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"An 18-year-old previously healthy male presented to cardiology clinic after experiencing syncope while running laps. He experienced loss of consciousness for a few minutes but was successfully resuscitated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Initial workup including electrolytes and toxicology screen was normal. However, his ECG showed the typical coved-type ST-segment changes in V1 and V2 consistent with BrS []. Since the syncope was triggered by exercise, he underwent a treadmill stress test, during which he became near syncopal and his rhythm degenerated to a wide complex tachycardia consistent with ventricular tachycardia []. His symptoms self-resolved shortly after exercise was stopped. A cardiac magnetic resonance imaging did not demonstrate any pathologic findings.
Genetic testing was done and the patient was found to have a pathogenic disease-causing mutation in the SCN5A gene consistent with BrS. The c. 4140_4142delCAA variant that was identified is located in coding exon 22 of the SCN5A gene and has been associated with varying degrees of cardiac conduction disorders, as well as a family history of sudden death in several studies.[] Additional testing including ECGs and genetic testing for the same mutation in his brother and parents came back negative. The patient underwent an electrophysiology study, which showed easily inducible, hemodynamically unstable polymorphic ventricular tachycardia at 260 bpm, requiring DC cardioversion for conversion to sinus rhythm. The patient was started on nadolol 40 mg daily and a transvenous dual-chamber implantable cardiac defibrillator was implanted. The patient underwent a subsequent exercise test that showed no ventricular tachycardia on beta-blockers.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"This is a 57-year-old male patient from eastern Morocco, followed up for 10 years for ankylosing spondylitis and admitted to the emergency room for an occlusive syndrome and abdominal pain. The symptomatology goes back two years with the onset of intermittent postprandial abdominal pain in the right iliac fossa which worsened on the day of his admission to the hospital. The clinical examination of our patient revealed tenderness in the right iliac fossa with palpation of a mobile mass measuring about 4 cm and free hernial orifices. The standard biological assessment carried out in the emergency room had objectified an inflammatory syndrome with a CRP increased to 60 mg/L and the CT scan had objectified a cockade image next to the last ileal handle. This image, which is probably related to an ileo-ileal invagination, is also the site of a circumferential thickening, regular symmetrical, measuring 14 mm in maximum thickness with respect for the adjacent fat and without individualization of peri-lesional lymphadenopathy (Figure ).
After multidisciplinary discussion and discussion with the patient, we opted for surgical exploration performed under general anesthesia which had demonstrated an intussusception 50 cm from the last intestinal loop on an intraluminal process with mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Bowel resection with lymphadenectomy involving intussusception with manual anastomosis was performed (Figures , ).
The pathological study noted the presence of an inflammatory pseudo-polyp integrating into chronic inflammatory bowel disease Crohn's type (Figures , ). The patient's postoperative progress course was uneventful, our patient was satisfied with the overall care and the discharge was carried out for five days under specific medical treatment for Crohn's disease.

"A 49-year-old woman presented with diarrhea approximately once every 30 min for two days prior to her visit. On arrival, she had a fever of 39.0°C with chills. The patient had persistent diarrhea and fever and had trouble moving; hence she required emergency assistance and was brought to our hospital. She was a current smoker, who smoked 10 cigarettes/day for 29 years and consumed 1,500 mL of cocktails per day. She owned a pet cat, and the cat licked her body surface regularly. She had a history of depression; however, she had not consulted a doctor for five years. She had no other medical history and was not taking any medications, including any over-the-counter medications.
Her height and body weight were 162 cm and 60 kg, respectively. On admission, consciousness was assessed using the Glasgow Coma Scale (score, 14) (E4V4M6), her body temperature was 38.0℃, pulse was 132 beats/min, blood pressure was 88/51 mmHg, respiratory rate was 24 breaths/min, and the peripheral arterial oxygen saturation was 94% (nasal cannula, 1 L). Physical examination revealed livedo reticularis on the lower limbs. There was no site of soft tissue infection with redness, heat, or swelling throughout the body. The blood tests that were performed are shown in Table . Arterial blood gas analysis showed mixed alkalosis and hyperlactatemia (serum lactate, 8.4 mg/dL). Conventional abdominal computed tomography revealed mild enlargement and a diffuse low-density area of the liver.
The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit in a state of septic shock with alcoholic cirrhosis, hypokalemia (serum potassium, 1.9 mEq/L) with frequent diarrhea, and disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome. The clinical course of the patients is shown in Figure . Blood, urine, and spinal fluid specimens were cultured, and piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g) was administered as an empiric therapy with the initiation of potassium replacement through a central vein. On the same day, the antibacterial agents were changed to meropenem (1 g every 12 h) and vancomycin (1.5 g every 24 h) due to deteriorating clinical conditions. Artificial respiration was started on the same day as the patient's respiratory condition worsened. After admission, she did not have frequent diarrhea. On the second day of admission, the patient’s renal function (serum creatinine, 2.6 mg/dL) and liver function (prothrombin time, 35.6%; total bilirubin, 6.0 mg/dL) worsened, thereby requiring continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF), plasma exchange therapy, and coagulation factor replacement. In addition, venoglobulin and amikacin 400 mg were administered for sepsis. The dosage of meropenem was changed to a severe dose of 2 g every 12 h considering the worsening clinical condition and the dosage of vancomycin was changed to 1 g every 24 h as the renal function worsened and CHDF was initiated. However, metabolic acidosis and hyperlactatemia progressed, and the patient died in the early hours of the third sick day. On the third day of admission, blood culture yielded P. multocida, which was susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"This is a 15-year-old boy with compound heterozygous LDLR c.313+1G>A and a deletion spanning exon 1–6. Both parents have HeFH with no evidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The patient was diagnosed at the age of 2 years old as a result of the presence of xanthomas. LDL-C levels were found to be elevated to 982 mg/dL, and diagnosis was confirmed via genetic testing. Asymptomatic aortic insufficiency was evident. Medication was commenced with atorvastatin 40 mg/day plus ezetimibe 10 mg/day. The patient received once-weekly lipoprotein apheresis, but LDL-C levels remained elevated (mean interval LDL-C 197 mg/dL). At the age of 8.5 years, chest pain led to a diagnosis of angina and a coronary bypass operation. LA was intensified to two times per week.
At 13.5 years of age, prior to the initiation of lomitapide, mean interval LDL-C levels were at 85 mg/dL with LA twice weekly, and therefore well below current treatment target. Unlike the other patients in this case series, the treatment plan for this patient was to attempt to maintain the LDL-C levels at target but to reduce the apheresis burden. Lomitapide was commenced at a dose of 5 mg/day and apheresis was decreased to once weekly. After 6 months, the lomitapide dose was intensified to 10 mg/day followed by 15 mg/day and after an additional 5 months, apheresis was reduced to Q2W. Through these modifications, LDL-C levels remained under control (nadir 62 mg/dL) (Fig. ).
No adverse events have been reported for lomitapide, liver enzymes and imaging are normal, and the patient has reported improved quality of life due to less disruption from apheresis sessions resulting in less time away from school, sports and other leisure activities. As a result, the LDL-C target levels have been maintained despite reducing apheresis burden by 75%.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"On 21 May 2009, a 42-yr-old male patient visited our hospital because of malaise and jaundice. He had been working as an office manager of a trading company in China for two years. Two mild fever, and one month before examination, he felt unusual fatigue and jaundice. Twenty days before examination, he had been informed that his acute hepatitis was unusual because he had no hepatitis A, B, or C viral markers. He took herbal medication and received acupuncture in China under the diagnosis of acute hepatitis of unknown origin. His symptoms improved under herbal medication, but remained. He returned to Korea for treatment of the acute hepatitis. He had no other symptoms except for scanty whitish phlegm. He had been healthy until the recent illness. He was not currently on medication, was not an injecting drug abuser. He did not smoke nor drink alcohol. He had received no blood transfusion. He had been married for seven years, but had lived alone in China for two years. He was well oriented and his vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed icteric sclera and tender hepatomegaly. No mucous membrane lesions nor lymphadenopathy were present and he was afebrile. Cutaneous manifestations consisted of macular and papular lesions, about 0.5 cm in diameter, localized on the trunk, palms, and soles (). Genital examination revealed no lesions nor ulcers. Lymph nodes were not palpable in the neck, axillary, or inguinal areas. Laboratory tests showed the following: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 2,974 IU/L, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) 1,755 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 89 IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 119 IU/L, total bilirubin 8.3 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 6.9 mg/dL, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, albumin 2.4 g/dL, total protein 9.2 g/dL, white blood cell (WBC) 13,600/µL, hemoglobin 9.7 g/dL, platelets 752,000/µL, international normalized ratio (INR) 1.06, venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) was positive with a titer >1:1,024, and his fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) was reactive. A hepatitis panel including IgM anti-HAV, HBsAg, and anti-HCV, antinuclear antibody, ceruloplasmin, copper, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were all nonreactive. Computerized tomography didn't show any evidence of bile duct obstruction. It showed also mildly enlarged liver, nonspecifically enlarged lymph nodes at the porta hepatis area, and thickened gall bladder wall (). Chest radiography was normal.
Liver biopsy revealed portal-to-portal or portal to central zone bridge necrosis, and widening by lymphocyte infiltration, accompanied by intracanalicular and intracellular cholestasis. These findings were compatible with acute hepatitis (). A modified Warthin-Starry stain was negative for spirochetes. Skin biopsy revealed a perivascular mixed-cell infiltrate of prominent plasma cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes around a blood vessel that contained swollen endothelial cells ().
The patient was treated with weekly intramuscular benzathine penicillin, 2,400,000 U, for a total of three doses. One week after treatment, his fatigue and rash were markedly improved. Three weeks after treatment, ALP was 288 IU/L, total bilirubin was 0.3 mg/dL () and four weeks after treatment, the VDRL titer was down to 1:64. He did not develop a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. Positive serologic tests and a prompt response to penicillin treatment confirmed the diagnosis of syphilitic cholestatic hepatitis.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 66-year-old female presented to our clinic with the mixed diagnosis of essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease, as she had both resting and action components of tremor in bilateral upper extremities with bradykinesia and rigidity that were somewhat improved on levodopa. The tremor was largely refractory to medication and interfered with her quality of life. She underwent bilateral DBS lead electrode implantation targeting the dentatorubrothalamic tract, specifically, the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim), in the thalamus using the standard stereotactic protocol.[] A trajectory through the ventricle was avoided. Normally, we start by implanting the microelectrodes on the more symptomatic side and then proceed to the other side. In this case, three microelectrodes were simultaneously descended to target the left Vim (as her symptoms were worse in her right hand) first, followed by another three microelectrodes to target the right Vim. Their cannulas were used for macrostimulation to assess for improvement and to choose the best trajectory. Electrode placement (Medtronic 3387 model, Minneapolis, MN, USA) then occurred after confirmed improvement in tremor. The rostral ends of the electrodes were left in a subgaleal pocket to be accessed during a subsequent staged procedure for extension and pulse generator placement. The lead placement was verified in the operating room theater with computed tomography (CT) imaging before closure. Surgery was uncomplicated, and the patient remained interactive and conversant throughout. She was admitted to our neurosurgical ICU as per routine. Head CT performed on early postoperative day (POD) 1 was unremarkable []. Physical examination revealed no deficit; the patient complained of headache with some nausea/vomiting. She desired to stay overnight. An examination later on the evening of POD 1 found her to be sleepy, and ultimately lethargic. Stat head CT performed revealed marked left-sided peri-lead edema extending into the centrum semiovale with cystic cavitation and trace right-sided edema []. Physical examination on the morning of POD 2 revealed the patient to be alert but with global aphasia (not following commands and not speaking), right-sided neglect, and plegic right upper extremity. Corticosteroids (IV dexamethasone) were begun early on POD 2. She later became increasingly lethargic, and over concerns for airway protection was intubated. Repeat head CT revealed increased edema.
The critical care team was concerned for fulminant gas- producing bacterial infection as suggested by neuroradiology interpretation of cavitation surrounding one lead and strongly pushed for lead removal, which was resisted. Vancomycin and meropenem were empirically begun. Systemic tests for infection, including C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and white blood cell counts, were normal, as well as blood cultures, which were ultimately negative at 24, 48, and 72 h. Such negative infectious workup and lack of change on serial repeat imaging disproved this idea. Magnetic resonance imaging could not be performed due to safety concerns at our institution with an incomplete DBS circuit. Acute venous infarction was also considered a possibility, but the radiological appearance of a cortical- subcortical typically wedge-shaped ischemic pattern was not present.[] This patient ultimately underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement 6 days later. She was transferred to a rehabilitation facility on a steroid taper and subsequently discharged home on POD 40. She returned to the clinic 3 months after surgery fully recovered and ready for lead extension and pulse generator placement. Follow-up CT scans at the time showed significant resolution of the peri-lead edema and cystic cavitation [].","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 27-year-old female reported with the chief complaint of a “fractured filling” in her left lower back tooth. History revealed intermittent pain localized to the same tooth during mastication. The tooth was previously restored with a silver amalgam restoration 7 years back. Clinical examination revealed a silver amalgam restoration with secondary caries in the left mandibular first molar (tooth 19) which was tender to percussion. Vitality tests elicited no response. Preoperative radiographs showed widening of periodontal ligament space in relation to the mesial root apex. In addition, radiographic apical contour of the tooth suggested that there might be two distal and two mesial roots (). From the clinical and radiographic findings a diagnosis of pulpal necrosis with symptomatic apical periodontitis was made and endodontic treatment was initiated.
Following endodontic access cavity preparation, two mesial and one buccally placed distal canal orifice was identified. Upon visual inspection of the floor of the pulp chamber using a dental operating microscope, a dark line was observed extending from the distal canal orifice towards the distolingual corner. At this corner, the overlying dentin was removed and a second distal canal orifice was detected. The conventional access was modified to improve access to the additional canals (). Root canal orifices were named as per the nomenclature proposed by Albuquerque et al. []. Working length was confirmed () and the canals were instrumented. Calcium hydroxide was placed as an intracanal medicament with a lentulospiral and the access cavity was sealed with Cavit G. The patient was asymptomatic at the next appointment, a week later, which allowed for root canal obturation and a coronal composite restoration ().","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"In August 2019, a six-year-old male patient manifested right eye (RE) excessive tearing, conjunctival injection and pain. Family history was unremarkable. The child was born after uncomplicated twin pregnancy, in 37th gestational week, but ultrasound assessment was consistent with 34th maturity week. Birth weight was 2100 g and Apgar score 9/10. Photographs before the event depicted isocoria without anterior segment asymmetry.
On examination, RE demonstrated visual acuity of light perception and intraocular pressure (IOP) of 36 mmHg. Left eye showed no abnormalities. The diagnoses of neovascular glaucoma, CRVO and CRAO were established as affirmed with fluorescein angiography (FA). Extensive systemic work-up was performed. Neurological and cardiologic examinations were unremarkable. Laboratory tests for tuberculosis, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma gondii, rubella, herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2, and HIV were negative, as well as factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation, MTHFR gene, anticardiolipin antibodies, and lupus anticoagulant. PHA was not reported in any of the findings. The child’s condition was perceived as idiopathic CRAO and CRVO, which led to the development of neovascular glaucoma. The patient was treated with antiglaucoma drugs topically (dorzolamide + timolol 20 mg/L + 5 mg/L drops b.i.d., latanoprost 50 μg/mL drops q.d., and acetazolamide 250 mg q.d.), panretinal photocoagulation, ranibizumab intravitreally and cyclophotocoagulation.
In December 2019, the child was referred to our Centre for second opinion. Clinical examination showed no light perception. The slit-lamp indirect lateral illumination revealed fully dilated, non-reactive RE pupil (Fig. a). Retroillumination verified blood cells in the HA lumen and anterior vitreous (Fig. b). RE IOP was 38 mmHg. Brückner’s transillumination revealed dim red reflex and tubular remnant of HA freely rotating in the anterior vitreous (Additional file 1). Closed angle and clear lens were depicted using ultrasound biomicroscopy (Fig. c). Extensive subhyaloid and intravitreal haemorrhages obscured visualization of fundus periphery and posterior pole (Fig. d). Thus, RE optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography could not be performed. Ultrasound B-scan affirmed low reflective membranous tubular structure of the persistent hyaloid artery extending freely into the vitreous demonstrating substantial after-movements (Fig. e). It originated within the optic nerve head measuring 4.92 × 1.08 mm (Fig. f).
Vascular occlusion incident was discerned as a consequence of the existence of patent HA in the highly mobile Cloquet’s canal. No therapeutic intervention was currently indicated, but only close follow-up because the patient did not complain of any eye pain.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 53-year-old man transferred 2 days following MI was awake, comfortable on room air, and hemodynamically stable without inotropes. His coronary angiogram revealed subtotal occlusion of LAD, and transthoracic echo showed a VSD 1.3 cm located on the anterior septum with EF 50%. He was scheduled for urgent closure of septal defect and a bypass grafting for LAD after the IABP insertion. General anesthesia was induced with remifentanil and propofol in titrated doses and maintained on midazolam, remifentanil, and propofol infusion with cisatracurium for muscle paralysis. The LAD grafting was performed, and the closure of defect was performed using Dacron patch and the pledgeted sutures to close ventriculotomy. He could be weaned off bypass without inotropes and was extubated on 1st postoperative day. The patient was discharged from intensive care in 48 h, and his remaining postoperative course was free of major complications.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 72-year-old female patient, with a symptomatic carotid stenosis previously identified by ultrasonography, has come to our attention to perform a CT angiography of the neck vessels. CT angiography examination showed the presence of a severe degree of carotid stenosis (equal to about 85% calculated with the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial method); therefore, the patient was candidate to perform a carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
However, the CT angiography has identified some significant incidental findings that have profoundly changed the patient management.
CT angiography identified an oval soft-tissue mass, well circumscribed with regular margins, with size of 34 mm × 28 mm × 23 mm, localized at the base of the tongue along the midline, with avid and inhomogeneous enhancement. This mass changed the aspect of the base of the tongue showing a major bulging on the lumen of the oropharynx, with a significant reduction of the caliber of the air column. More inferiorly, just above the geniohyoid muscle on the midline and in proximity to the hyoid bone, we detected another oval, soft-tissue mass with the same characteristics previously described, and a size of 12 mm × 22 mm × 22 mm. Finally, CT angiography revealed the absence of thyroid tissue in its normal position [].
The knowledge of the embryologic thyroid course, the absence of thyroid gland in its normal position, the location of the two masses along the midline, and their appearance on CT-scans suggest a dual ectopic thyroid, a lingual thyroid (in the base of the tongue) and suprahyoid thyroid (just above the geniohyoid muscle on the midline, in close proximity to the hyoid bone), respectively.
The ultrasound evaluation of the sublingual mass, performed by a linear array transducer (10–15 MHz), documented the typical ultrasound characteristics of the thyroid tissue [].
The patient was then evaluated by otorhinolaryngology and the diagnosis of lingual thyroid was clinically confirmed. Thyroid function tests were found in the normal range.
This patient was originally scheduled for CEA which is effective in preventing ipsilateral ischemic events in patients with symptomatic moderate and high-grade stenosis. The radiological detection and subsequently clinical confirmation of lingual thyroid addressed the patient to an endovascular procedure, by carotid angioplasty and stenting. This alternative approach was chosen to minimize the risks of an endotracheal intubation, such as hemorrhage and compromised airway. In particular, the large blood vessels on the surface of the lingual thyroid could be traumatized by the insertion of any instruments during intubation, with potential onset of hemorrhage and compromised airway.[]","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 28-year-old male presented to the emergency department (ED) with progressively worsening odynophagia and dysphagia. He had been diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus five months prior after initially presenting to an outside hospital with odynophagia and weight loss. Given difficulty affording his antiretrovirals, he reported only intermittently taking emtricitabine-tenofovir and was lost to follow-up. He was unaware of his oral lesions and overall grim clinical status. Seven days prior to presentation he developed mild dyspnea as well as worsening dysphagia. Physical examination of the oral cavity revealed a 3 × 3 centimeter (cm) violaceous, pedunculated, midline posterior mass partially occluding the airway, as well as a 2 × 2 cm anterior hard palate, violaceous mass ().
The exam was also notable for extensive cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy, global wasting, and a muffled voice. He was able to speak in full sentences, was tolerating his secretions, and did not have evidence of respiratory distress. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) revealed reactive cervical lymphadenopathy ().
Computed tomography soft tissue neck () and chest revealed nodular thickening of upper airway structures, cervical lymphadenopathy, diffuse ground-glass opacities, and large bilateral pleural effusions.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics including trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis. Otolaryngology was consulted in the ED and performed a bedside laryngoscopy.. He was admitted for tracheostomy the following day. Excisional biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of disseminated Kaposi sarcoma. Given his extensive disease burden, he was started on systemic chemotherapy.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 62-year-old female presented with chief complaints of floaters in the right eye (RE) for 3 weeks. She was a known diabetic (on OHD) since 6 years and hypertensive since 10 years (on treatment), rheumatoid arthritis (on treatment), and with no known adverse drug reactions. Her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 4/60 in RE and 6/6 in left eye (LE). On examination, her anterior segment revealed normal findings in both the eyes except for relative afferent pupillary defect in RE. Posterior segment revealed multiple intraretinal haemorrhages all over the superior quadrant, engorged tortuous blood vessels, and CME in RE while there was no abnormality in LE. A provisional diagnosis of RE hemicentral retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) with CME was made []. Her blood pressure was 160/90 mm of Hg, and her blood investigations showed deranged lipid profile and raised blood sugar. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a central macular thickness of 551 μ with intraretinal cystic spaces and fluid []. Fundus fluorescein angiography of RE revealed capillary dropouts and nonperfusion areas corresponding to the area of vein occlusion along with angiographic CME. She received a single intravitreal injection bevacizumab following which her vision improved to 6/36. Her OCT of RE revealed a full thickness MH a month later! [ and ] She was explained about requiring surgery. Over the next 18 months, she received 5 more injections of intravitreal Bevacizumab. Her RE BCVA before vitrectomy was 6/18. A 25G vitrectomy was performed and intraoperatively posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) had to be induced, conventional internal limiting membrane peeling done and a tamponade of C3F8 (perfluoropropane) was given. Four months postsurgery, her RE BCVA 6/24 with cataract formation and MH Type 1 (U-shaped) closure was seen [ and ]. In the subsequent months, she underwent cataract extraction following which she developed CME. She underwent scatter laser (sectoral superior quadrant) in her RE along with intravitreal injection Ranibizumab three times. She has remained in regular follow-ups ever since and her BCVA has remained stable at 6/9 [].","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 51-year-old man suffered from progressive dysphagia to solids for over about 6 months and slow weight loss of 5 kg was referred to our institution with the presumptive diagnosis of achalasia. Preoperative workup consisted in a careful clinical history, correct interpretation of anamnesis, and symptoms; then esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and showed a dilated esophagus without evident mucosal lesion, and the passage through the cardia was more difficult: “crossing snap” passage. Manometry revealed absence of peristalsis and impaired swallow-induced LES relaxation with classic manometric pattern (). The barium swallow showed an emptying defect with “bird beak” sign and narrowing at esophageal junction (). We made a diagnosis of esophageal achalasia and performed a laparoscopic Heller's myotomy with Dor fundoplication (Figures and ). We use the laparoscopic approach to perform this kind of surgery. Several studies demonstrate that this is the best way to treat this pathology. We use Veres' needle placed in Palmer's point to create pneumoperitoneum and then we place five trocars: the first 10–12 mm trocar is placed in supraumbilical region, two 10–12 mm trocars in right and left side, and two 5 mm trocars in paraxiphoid region and left iliac region []. The surgical exploration of peritoneal cavity does not reveal any anatomic abnormality or suspect neoplastic lesions or secondary localizations. Two months after surgery, the patient complained of worsening dysphagia. We repeated several esophagogastroduodenoscopies with numerous biopsies that showed only cardia inflammation and were negative for malignancy. Tumor markers were negative too. Balloon dilatation was performed to improve symptoms. Persisting dysphagia, one month after we performed EUS with biopsies, showed infiltrating gastric adenocarcinoma of the cardia (T3 WHO, Siewert II) (). After staging CT scan, total gastroesophagectomy was performed, with D2 lymph-node resection and Roux-en-Y reconstruction. The surgical specimen contained a thick, hard tumor 3,6 × 2,5 × 1,3 cms located in the gastroesophageal junction (Siewert II), extensively infiltrating the wall and reaching in some areas the subserosal layer (Figures and ). Histological finding was “poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (WHO: G3)” (Figures and ).","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 51-year-old cirrhotic man presented with abdominal pain for one day. He then had a sudden upper gastrointestinal bleeding and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated that a ruptured SAA located near to splenic hilum and formation of hematoma in left epigastric region (). Further ultrasonography confirmed liver cirrhosis and ascites. He underwent an urgent laparotomy. After dissection of severely adhered tissues, a pulsatile mass approximate 4.8 cm×5.6 cm×4.9 cm was found closely adhensive to stomach and splenic hilum. SAA resection, splenectomy, gastric suture and conventional splenorenal shunt were performed thereafter and the recovery was uneventful.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 56-year-old man, case of carcinoma mid-oesophagus underwent TTE with extended two-field lymphadenectomy with gastric pull-up and oesophago-gastric anastomosis in neck. He had received pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy. The procedure was done under epidural and general anaesthesia with conventional monitoring. Right ICD and corrugated neck drain were placed. Intraoperative period was uneventful. Patient was shifted to ICU for post-operative management. The patient developed respiratory distress and air leak through right ICD and saturation decreased to 86% despite oxygen supplementation. Air entry was decreased on the right side. Chest radiograph revealed right pneumothorax despite ICD being in situ. It was decided to conduct bronchoscopy. Before bronchoscopy, we observed bubbles (air leak) from neck drain site. On removal of corrugated neck drain and resuturing the neck wound, air leak stopped and there was no further respiratory distress. Oxygen saturation improved to 96% over next 30 min. Chest X-ray revealed no pneumothorax and patient was shifted to the ward.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"In June 2018, a 65-year-old man presented at an outside facility with an epigastric discomfort and mass for about 2 months. The movable mass started as a small lump and gradually increased in size. Laboratory values were unremarkable. Gastroscopy revealed a malignant tumor in the gastric body. Pathology showed small cell malignant tumors. Histomorphometry showed that the tumor originated in the lymphoid and hematological system. There was too little biopsy tissue to determine the differentiation. In July 2018, the patient presented to our hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. We performed upper gastrointestinal contrast to identify the tumor site. Barium x-ray revealed that the tumor was located in the gastric body and about 102 mm size (Fig. ). Abdomen computed tomography (CT) showed that the gastric cavity was full of chyme, and the irregular soft tissue shadow was seen in the greater curvature, and the enhancement was obvious (Fig. ). It was considered as a malignant tumor of gastric body. To get more tissue, we conducted stomach puncture biopsy. Pathology showed small-round cell malignant tumors. And immunohistochemical examinations revealed that the tumor tend to be a plasma cell tumor. To exclude associated multiple myeloma (MM), patient underwent bone marrow biopsy. His bone marrow morphology test, peripheral blood smear, and serum protein electrophoresis were found to be normal. In September 2018, the patient underwent distal gastrectomy. The tumor located in the anterior wall of the stomach body near the greater curvature (Fig. ). The tumor was a centrally ulcerated, relatively well-demarcated bulky mass, measuring 90 × 90 mm in diameter (Fig. ). Histopathologic examination of the specimen revealed plasmablastic plasmacytoma originating in the stomach with transmural extension (Fig. ), but without lymph node metastasis. These cells were positive for CD38, CD138, MUM-1, bcl-2, and CD23 and negative for CD3, CD20, CD79a, CyclinD1, CD10, bcl-6, CD5, CK, EMA, and CD30, with a Ki-67 proliferative index of about 70% (Fig. ). The patient had a good postoperative recovery and other than ascites caused by hypoproteinemia, there was no complications and the patient was successfully discharged. To October 1, he is regularly followed up at a postoperative clinic and is doing well, and there is no plan for adjuvant treatment.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"This patient, a five-year-old African-American female, fell at school and developed severe left knee pain. Three days after falling, the patient's mother contacted her primary-care physician where she reported her daughter's severe left knee pain that prevented her from walking and had worsened since the initial injury. At this point, the patient's left knee was also warm and erythematous. She and her daughter were referred to her local emergency department where radiographs of the patient's left knee were conducted and were read as unremarkable with no signs of trauma (). The patient was, therefore, diagnosed with a left knee sprain and was treated conservatively with pain control (ice and NSAIDs) and NWB without further intervention.
Eleven days later, the patient was seen by her primary-care physician for her persistent limp and intermittent pain, although her swelling had resolved. Anteroposterior view of the pelvis and bilateral frog lateral radiographs were ordered to rule out any hip pathologies, which could also cause an antalgic gait. All films were read by an attending radiologist and were deemed unremarkable. Relying on these reads, the primary-care physician recommended the patient to continue supportive care (NSAIDs and ice for pain, nonweight bearing for left lower extremity) and to refer to an orthopedist if symptoms persisted.
Despite these treatments, the patient's pain and limp persisted, and the patient then sought a referral to a general pediatric orthopedist for further work-up. Although the child's pain had slightly improved, her limp remained. She described her left knee pain as worse at night but responsive to acetaminophen and ice. She had never felt anything like this before prior to her initial fall. Both the patient and her mother denied fever, weight loss, fatigue, malaise, or recent infection. On physical exam, her left knee did not have a palpable mass, muscle atrophy, or edema, but was tender to palpation. Given concern for the persistent pain and antalgic gait, repeat radiographs of the left knee were also ordered by the orthopedist and showed aggressive poorly defined lytic lesion centered within the left distal femur metadiaphysis extending up proximally 6 cm superiorly from the metaphysis with associated interrupted superior periosteal involvement (). A radiologist reviewed these findings and agreed with the orthopedist that based on these radiographic findings, there was concern for a primary bone malignancy. Arthrocentesis of the left knee was performed to rule out a possible infectious etiology, which was negative. Acute-phase reactants including c-reactive protein, sedimentation rate, and leukocyte count were all within normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and needle biopsy were ordered to establish diagnosis. Contrast-enhanced MRI examination showed a enhancing mass centered in the distal femoral metaphysis approximately 7 cm in craniocaudal dimension with aggressive periosteal involvement (). Needle biopsy of the left distal femur was performed at the site of the lesion, and pathology demonstrated cores of tumor tissue consisting of pleomorphic tumor cells with frequent mitoses, foci of necrosis, regions of chondroblastic differentiation, and rare small foci of malignant osteoid production, consistent with the diagnosis of osteosarcoma. Additional imaging, including chest computerized tomography (CT) and whole body Positron Emission Tomography (PET), was obtained for tumor staging and demonstrated no evidence of distant metastases.
The patient was then referred to an orthopedic surgeon to discuss treatment options including oncologic and operative interventions. Given the concern for pathological fracture and possible subsequent contamination of healthy tissue from this tumor, the patient was placed in a knee immobilizer to limit weight bearing (NWB LLE with walker). The patient and her parents were referred to an oncologist to determine a chemotherapy plan. A typical treatment plan of osteosarcoma involves surgical resection and six cycles of chemotherapy (two cycles preoperatively as neoadjuvant therapy and four cycles postoperatively) with high-dose methotrexate, doxorubicin/dexrazoxane, and cisplatin.
Operative treatments were discussed between the family and the attending orthopaedic surgeon in great detail including potential risks and benefits, and the family chose to proceed with Van Nes Rotationplasty. Radical resection of the left distal femur 17 cm from the joint line with femur/tibia osteoplasty with internal fixation and Van Nes Rotationplasty of the left lower extremity and left sciatic neuroplasty was performed. The procedure lasted around eight hours long without complications. Estimated blood loss was 100 mL or less. The patient was transferred to the PICU for monitoring postoperatively. There were no wound complications postoperatively, and the patient received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and cefepime for antibiotic prophylaxis. Nine days later, the patient was discharged with referrals to physical therapy and the appropriative postoperative wound care instructions.
The patient was treated with chemotherapy for five months postoperatively and responded well. Since finishing chemotherapy treatments, the patient has continued with physical therapy and has been fitted for a lower extremity prosthetic. Postoperative radiographs have demonstrated appropriate healing of the rotationplasty (). Six-month postoperative Positron Emission Tomography (PET) showed no evidence of local or distant metastatic disease. There was minimal uptake in the left lower extremity at the location of the rotationplasty. The procedure with the appropriate adjuvant chemotherapy was deemed successful.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 68-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital with chest pain for 6 months and lower limb fatigue for 1 month. There had been no obvious cause for the onset of back pain 6 months ago. This pain was particularly evident at night and had become more severe and accompanied by lower limb fatigue 1 month previously. He had received no anti-TB therapy before admission. X-rays, MRI and CT of spine, routine blood tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations and hepatorenal function were examined. He had a white blood cell count was 5.7 × 109/L, ESR 87 mm/1h, CRP concentration 21.4 mg/L and normal hepatorenal function.
The patient consented to publication of data concerning his case.
Physical examination showed hypesthesia below the rib arch, Grade 1 lower limb muscle strength and Frankel Grade C neurological function. It also showed increased muscular tone in the lower limbs, knee and ankle hyperreflexia and positive sign for ankle clonus.
X-ray films showed collapse of the T8 vertebrae and T7–8 intervertebral space. CT scan showed destruction of T7, T8 and the intervertebral space and sequestrum formation, especially on the left side. A paravertebral abscess was limited to T7 and T8 without an obvious gravitation abscess. The height of the T8 vertebral body was markedly reduced and the dural sac and spinal cord severely compressed by an abscess posterior to the vertebral body.
The patient was administered the anti-TB drugs isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide prior surgery. He underwent surgical debridement, interbody fusion and internal fixation via a posterior approach 7 days after starting anti-TB therapy because his paralysis progressively worsened after commencing chemotherapy. He continued to receive anti-TB chemotherapy for 18 months postoperatively.
The patient was placed in a prone position under general anesthesia with somatosensory-evoked potential monitoring. Extraperiosteal dissection at both non-fusion and fusion levels was performed through a midline incision. The posterior spinal construction was exposed, including the spinous processes, lamina, facet joints and transverse processes and the range of exposure at the level of decompression expanded to include the costotransverse articulations and 3–5 cm of the medial ribs bilaterally. Pedicle screws or hooks were placed at one or two levels superior and inferior to the level of decompression under C-arm fluoroscopy guidance.
One side rod was fixed temporarily to avoid spinal cord injury during decompression and focal debridement. Lesion debridement to drain the prevertebral abscess and expose the diseased vertebral bodies was performed from the side with more bone destruction and a larger abscess (left). The facet joint was resected unilaterally and the lower costotransverse joints excised with a small fragment of adjoining rib if in the thoracic segment, retaining contralateral structural integrity (Figs , ), while protecting the spinal cord and nerve root. Spatulas of various sizes and angles were used from a posterior approach to remove all lesions, including sequestra, abscesses and granulation tissues. The abscesses were drained by suction and curettage as thoroughly as possible.
After distracting the intervertebral space, specially constructed titanium mesh cages or bone blocks were implanted into the interbody (Fig. ). Both ends of the titanium mesh cages were filled with autologous bone with allograft or autogenous bone in the middle. Both side rods were then fixed and both sides compressed to tighten the mesh cages and bone blocks. After completion of internal fixation, debridement and interbody thoracic fusion were performed, and strip-sized autogenous or allograft bone imbedded in the posterior body to fuse the segments that had been subjected to decompression and focal debridement. Streptomycin (1.0 g) and isoniazid (0.3 g) were deposited locally. The debrided material underwent bacterial culture and histopathologic examination.
Antibiotics were given i.v. injection during the first postoperative week. The drainage tube was removed when the drainage volume was less than 20 mL/24 h. The patient was asked to wear a brace as soon as possible and then for at least for 6 months. The patient received anti-TB chemotherapy with the four drugs mentioned above for at least 9 months and isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol treatment for another 3–6 months thereafter.
The patient was examined clinically and radiologically 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery and then at yearly intervals. X-rays and blood tests were examined. Bone graft fusion was assessed using Bridwell's radiologic criteria. The patient had significant improvement in back pain after surgery and had achieved bony spinal fusion 6 months after surgery. His ESR and CRP had recovered to normal values by 3 months postoperatively.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"We examined a 33-year-old male with progressive painless decrease in vision and nystagmus since childhood and no history of night blindness. His best corrected visual acuity was 20/80 with 0.00 diopter sphere (D Sph) / -4.00 diopter cylinder (D Cyl) X 10° in the right eye and 20/60 with 0.00 D Sph / -3.50 D Cyl X 170° in the left eye respectively. Color vision was normal on examination with Ishihara plates. A positive history of similar abnormality was obtained in his sibling (elder brother had similar abnormality). There was no history of consanguinity. Slit-lamp examination was normal and iris did not show any transillumination defect. Intraocular pressure using applanation tonometry was 15 mm of Hg in both eyes. Fundus examination showed macular vascularization, macular hypoplasia and hypoplasic optic nerve head with diffuse retinal pigment epithelial atrophy and prominent choroidal vessels in both eyes. Patient was clinically diagnosed to have foveal hypoplasia. A genetic analysis revealed an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern.
SD-OCT (Copernicus, Italy) was done in both eyes using asterisk scan protocol (7 mm length scan, 6 B-scans with 2743 A-scans per B-scan). SD-OCT was recorded with the eyes in the null zone, to overcome nystagmus. The scan location was assured by positioning the asterisk scan acquisition pattern over the foveal area and this location was assured as the scan passes through the fovea in the fundus image obtained in SD-OCT. The scan revealed absence of foveal dip, preservation of the inner retinal layers with thickened fovea, 270 microns in the right eye and 245 microns in the left eye. The qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the retina were similar in macular and peripheral areas (2° and 7° respectively). The small elevation of the inner segment/ outer segment (IS/OS) junction was absent in the fovea which is otherwise present in normal eyes.
Microperimetry (MP1, Nidek Technologies, Padova, Italy) using 33 stimuli in the central 20° of the macula and 4-2 threshold strategy revealed reduction of retinal sensitivity in the central retina. Mean retinal sensitivity was 7.2 dB in the right eye and 14.2 dB in the left eye. Relative scotoma was present in both eyes at the foveal area. Fixation was relatively unstable in both eyes, with abnormal fixation location (central fixation in the right eye and eccentric fixation in the left eye). Average eye movements during the microperimetry were 1.27°/sec in the right eye and 1.49°/sec in the left eye. Figs. and describe the color fundus photography, microperimetry and SD-OCT findings in our case.

"This patient is a 29-year-old white woman from the USA with a medical history significant for severe IBS-D (diagnosed at age 12) and anxiety disorder. In July 2015, she presented with severe bleeding hemorrhoids secondary to IBS, which required hemorrhoidectomy and anal sphincterotomy in August 2015. The week before the surgery she developed pharyngitis and was treated with azithromycin, which resulted in mucousy diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. She tested negative for C. difficile antigen and toxins at that time.
A week after surgery, she developed a perirectal abscess that had formed at the site of the sphincterotomy and was prescribed orally administered ciprofloxacin. Despite moderate symptom improvement, in September 2015 she required an abscess incision and drainage procedure and Penrose drain insertion. Prior to the surgery she was given a single dose of clindamycin. An additional 2-week course of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole was then prescribed. In late September 2015 she was admitted to the hospital for two nights due to further complications related to the abscess and was then diagnosed as having a perianal fistula.
In November 2015, she was prescribed clindamycin for an episode of group C streptococcal-positive pharyngitis. In late November 2015, she was also diagnosed as having Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, which according to her medical record may partially explain the poor wound healing from the perirectal abscess. In December 2015, her fistula required an anus seton placement. She was treated with multiple courses of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole off and on from December 2015 to January 2016.
In January 2016, following up on her recurrent pharyngitis, she was diagnosed as having chronic tonsillitis which led to tonsillectomy. In February 2016, 2 weeks after the surgery she was prescribed clindamycin. At the beginning of March 2016, she was diagnosed as having bacterial vaginosis and was prescribed orally administered metronidazole. A week later she was diagnosed as having vaginal candidiasis and was prescribed orally administered fluconazole. In April 2016, she complained of dysuria and was prescribed ciprofloxacin. After 2 days, when urine analysis results came back negative, she was asked by her physician to stop the treatment.
In June 2016, she presented for follow-up with ongoing diarrhea and abdominal pain. She was diagnosed as having C. difficile diarrhea, her antigen and toxins laboratory results were indeterminate, and a toxigenic strain was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). She was prescribed a 6-week course of orally administered vancomycin. After a week of treatment her symptoms worsened, and following discussion with her gastroenterologist her treatment was switched to a 2-week course of metronidazole. Hours later, she was admitted to the hospital for a 4-day period for colitis. Her C. difficile antigen and toxin test returned negative during her admission. She received intravenously administered metronidazole treatment during her hospitalization. Her symptoms improved during her hospital stay, with 1–2 soft bowel movements a day. At discharge her metronidazole course was stopped and she was again prescribed vancomycin, which she took for over a month. She continued to experience GI irregularity (3–5 bowel movements a day) beyond what she had experienced secondary to her IBS prior to her surgeries. In March 2017, she was prescribed rifaximin for 2 weeks to treat chronic diarrhea.
In November 2017, she was prescribed a series of clinical intestinal tests (SmartGut™, uBiome Inc., San Francisco, USA) with the instructions to administer the test at home whenever she was experiencing a noticeable change of GI symptoms, then follow-up with her health care provider to discuss the results. This sequencing-based test requires that patients use a sterile swab to transfer a small amount of fecal material from toilet paper into a vial containing a lysis and stabilization buffer that preserves the microbial DNA for transport by mail back to the laboratory for processing, which involves DNA extraction, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplification, and sequencing []. She first used this test in November 2017, about a month after completing a 2-week course of rifaximin. The results revealed a number of microbial organisms that were outside the healthy reference ranges, but she was negative for all pathogenic organisms included in the test, including C. difficile (Fig. ).
Between November and December 2017, her GI symptoms worsened considerably; her daily bowel movements increased from 3–4 to 6–10, stool consistency became more mucous-like and gelatinous, and she was experiencing more pain with defecation. She re-tested with SmartGut™ test again in January 2018. Her results continued to reveal a number of microbial organisms outside the healthy range and, this time, her sample also indicated the presence of C. difficile (Fig. ). She immediately contacted her primary care provider, who re-tested her for C. difficile and confirmed indeterminate CDI by antigen and toxins A and B. Additional PCR testing at a regional laboratory confirmed the sample was positive for a toxigenic C. difficile strain. As a result of testing, her clinician started her on fidaxomicin; her symptoms improved rapidly. By April 2018, she had returned to her baseline in regard to her IBS-related GI symptoms with no blood in her stools.
In addition, the second SmartGut™ sample was tested for toxins A and B by sequencing at uBiome Inc. laboratory in San Francisco, USA, which resulted positive for both and confirmed the toxigenic nature of the C. difficile strain.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 3-day-old female child, (full-term, normal delivery) weighing 2.75 kg at birth with stable vitals, moderate abdominal distension and history of not being able to pass meconium was referred to us. Examination showed normal anal opening but red rubber catheter could not be passed beyond 3 cm of anal verge. Spine and external genitalia were normal. X-ray (invertogram with red rubber catheter passed through anal opening) showed catheter abutting the air column in the bowel) [].
With anal retractors anal canal was opened but upper-end of membrane could not be seen.
An endoscopy was done with a 7.5F cystoscope. About 3 cm from the anal verge, the anal canal ended blindly and a membrane was visualized at the blind end. We incised the outer mucosal membrane, i.e. of the distal pouch with a bugbee, but the vision was lost due to technical reasons. Then anal retractors were used, and after the incision on the mucosa of the distal pouch, the inner mucosal membrane was seen bulging significantly due to meconium within it [].
Transanal membranotomy was done. Postoperatively, on day one, dye study was done and feeds were started. Patient was discharged on day 4.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 62-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of mental abnormality and hypomnesia for 3 months. The main mental symptoms were gibberish, irrational talk, impaired mental attention, without apparent hallucinations and delusions. The patient did not present with fluctuating consciousness, lack of consciousness, or loss of consciousness. The family of the patient reported that she had a history of fever before she experienced the mental symptoms. Her highest body temperature was 38.6 °C. Her axillary temperature became normal after she received antibiotic therapy for 4 days. However, she gradually developed symptoms of mental abnormality. She also intermittently complained of abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, and urinary incontinence for 1 month. She did not experience other discomforts, such as headaches, dizziness, and convulsion. She visited a local hospital in October 2018, and the routine blood test showed that the white blood cell counts were normal, and the percentage of lymphocytes was high. The blood potassium was 1.91 mmol/l (normal 3.5-5.3 mmol/l), and the prolactin level was 90.55 μg/l (normal 2.74–26.72 μg/l). The free thyroxine was slightly high, the thyroglobulin antibody was 12.32 IU/ml (normal 0–115 IU/ml), and the thyroid peroxidase antibody was 10.42 IU/ml (normal 0–34 IU/ml). The testing results of antinuclear antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anti-Jo-1 antibody, anti-dsDNA antibody, anti-Scl-70 antibody, anti-SSA antibody, and anti-SSB antibody were yielded negative, and the tests for hepatitis, HIV, and syphilis virus were also negative. The local hospital suspected intracranial infection, endocrine disease, and electrolyte disorders and gave her symptomatic treatment. Nevertheless, her symptoms showed no noticeable improvement. It was difficult to diagnose the disease, so the patient was admitted to our hospital. The patient had a history of diabetes, hypertension, erosive gastritis, and cataract surgery, but she had no family history of neurological diseases.
The physical examination revealed that her body temperature was 36.8 °C, and there was tenderness below the xiphoid. The neurological examination showed impaired mental attention and reaction capacity, slow speech, normal manifestations of the brain nerve, normal muscle strength, and muscle tone, negative meningeal irritation sign and pathological reflex, normal tendon reflex. The patient could not cooperate with the sensory system examination. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score was only 6/30.
Encephalitis was initially suspected, and lumbar puncture was performed. The CSF examination showed that the CSF pressure was 110 mmH2O, and the white blood cell count was normal, but she had an increased total protein level of 0.57 g/l (normal 0.15–0.45 g/l) and a glucose level of 5.10 mmol/l (normal 2.2–3.9 mmol/l). The coxsackie B virus, enterovirus, and cytomegalovirus test levels were normal. Bacterial culture and Cryptococcus neoformans tests were negative. A contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain was normal. The diagnosis of encephalitis was excluded in general. However, leukoencephalopathy was evident on the T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. A high-signal intensity in the white matter of the cerebral hemisphere, especially at the subcortex of the frontotemporal and corona radiata, was found on the T2 FLAIR images (Fig. a-c). The MRI imaging of the left basal ganglia and bilateral corona radiata showed lacunar infarction. Magnetic resonance angiography indicated that the blood vessels were normal. The DWI results revealed a symmetrically distributed strip-shaped high-intensity signal of the corticomedullary junction in the bilateral frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes (Fig. d-f).
Skin biopsy samples were obtained at 10 cm above the patient’s ankle. A light microscope was used to examine the samples, which showed hyperkeratosis of the epidermis. A few lymphocytes and tissue cells infiltrated through the superficial vessels of the dermis (Fig. a). Electron microscopy showed round-shaped intranuclear inclusions in the nucleus of the fibrocytes. The intranuclear inclusions had clear borders and were composed of fibrous substances without a membrane structure (Fig. b and c).
The fasting blood glucose was 9.48 mmol/l, and glycosylated hemoglobin was 6.6%. The routine urine test showed normal results. The patient presented with mental abnormality for 3 months. We did not consider the diagnoses of hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome. Furthermore, the patient did not present with depression, anxiety, consciousness disorders, hallucinations, and neurasthenia, which were common mental symptoms in patients with diabetes. The results of the electrolyte showed hypokalemia (2.6 mmol/L), hyponatremia (127.3 mmol/L), and hypochloremia (86.5 mmol/L). The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and cortisol hormone tests showed normal results. The MRI of the hypophysis showed no abnormal areas. The electroencephalography showed low-and moderate-amplitude desynchronized-mixed waves when she fell asleep.
Brain protection and symptomatic therapy were given when the patient was hospitalized, and the symptoms were relieved. However, she still complained of recurrent vomiting and urinary incontinence. The patient was alive, and the condition of the patient did not worsen or improve for 6 months after she was discharged.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"We present the case of a white, Hispanic, 58-year-old, non-smoker female. She has a past medical history of obstructive sleep apnea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis). Her travel history includes the Dominican Republic and Caribbean Islands. She worked for several years in an automobile repair shop and was exposed to lead and paint. Her current occupation is as a telephone operator in a call center, which requires her to speak continually.
Fifteen years ago, she developed a progressive cough. During the following four years, she was evaluated by more than eight pulmonologists who were unable to make a diagnosis. She developed a productive cough with white sputum and blood titer. Her alpha-1-antitrypsin serum, perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (P-ANCA), cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (C-ANCA), and rheumatoid factor were all within normal limits. Her purified protein derivative (PPD) and fungal infection tests were negative. Lung function tests revealed an obstructive pattern. Her forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) was 70% and total lung capacity (TLC) was 72%. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed mild ground glass infiltrates in the lung bases (Figure ).
Finally, in December 2011, a lung biopsy via assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was performed, and she was diagnosed with constrictive bronchiolitis and diffuse idiopathic neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia with carcinoid tumorlets. She was treated with octreotide; however, the treatment was interrupted several times due to issues with insurance and difficulties visiting the medical center. Her treatment was restarted in our hospital after three years in May 2014. Since then, CT scans taken every six months show a stable disease. She currently has a stable radiographic disease with no new complaints during the over two years of follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 66-year-old male visited our ophthalmology department because of decreased visual acuity in his left eye of 10 days duration. The patient had a past history of ocular trauma to the left eye while mowing his lawn 6 months before his visit. He had not been treated because he did not feel any discomfort. On presentation, his best-corrected visual acuities (BCVAs) were 1.0 and 0.4 in the right and left eye, respectively. The intraocular pressure was 11 mmHg in the right eye and 14 mmHg in the left eye. In the right eye, the anterior segment did not show any obvious abnormalities. In the left eye, corneal opacity, which did not involve the visual axis, an incidental intralenticular metallic foreign body, and lens opacity were found. The posterior lens capsule was intact (). There was no inflammation in the cornea or anterior chamber. Funduscopy showed no definite abnormalities in either eye. Emergent surgical removal was performed. Under local anesthesia, capsulorrhexis of the anterior lens capsule and hydrodissection and hydrodelineation of the lens were performed via a corneal incision site. With viscoelastic aid, the intralenticular foreign body was elevated into the anterior chamber. The foreign body was then removed with foreign body forceps. Phacoemulsification and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation was then performed. The implanted IOL was an AcrySof™ (SA60AT, Optic 6.0 mm, Length 13.0 mm, Alcon, USA). The diameter of the removed foreign body was about 1 mm and it was identified to be metallic by a magnet. It was thought to be a part of the lawn mower blade (). At 3 days postoperatively, the BCVA of the left eye was 1.0. There were no specific findings except trace cell reactions in the anterior chamber. At 17 days postoperatively, the BCVA of the left eye was 1.0. There was no inflammation in the anterior chamber and the IOL was well-seated ().","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"Patient II was a 65-year-old man who experienced right shoulder pain for >1 month with no history of trauma and known left-sided weakness after right cerebral infarction 15 years before. He complained of unbearable pain despite corticosteroid injection 3 weeks before. Subjective pain on the VAS was 7 at rest, 9 during motion. On physical examination, empty-can and Hawkin's tests were positive. US demonstrated substantial effusion of the long biceps tendon and SASD bursa with a full-thickness tear of the supraspinatus and a partial thickness tear of subscapularis tendon. He did not want MRI for economic reasons. Under US guidance, 7 mL of the clear bursal fluid was aspirated, and a triamcinolone mixture was injected in the same way. All laboratory results, including bursal fluid, were within normal limits. Compared with the scores after 1 month, his pain score on the VAS slightly decreased from 7 to 4 at rest, from 9 to 6 during motion. Although pain abated, an additional 3 mL of bursal fluid was aspirated, and triamcinolone injected again. Upon review 3 months after the repeat procedure, his pain score on the VAS decreased from 4 to 2 at rest, from 6 to 4 during motion.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 31-year-old, ASA II, superobese male patient (190 kg, 180 cm, BMI: 58 kg/m2) was admitted to the emergency department with a segmental Gustilo-Anderson type IIIA open tibial fracture and ankle dislocation following an in-vehicle traffic accident. The initial proper management of open fracture and joint dislocation was performed by orthopaedic and traumatology surgeons in the emergency department. The patient had no history of additional diseases. The preoperative airway examination revealed a class 3 Mallampati airway and, in light of the difficulty of intubation, an intrathecal block with a 150 mm needle was planned. After the written consent was obtained, 2 mg IV midazolam and 50 μg fentanyl were administered for sedation. The vertebral anatomical structures were barely distinguishable despite ultrasound guidance. After two unsuccessful attempts, we decided not to use spinal anesthesia and planned to perform a combined sciatic and femoral nerve block. As a tourniquet was not required above the knee, the blockade of these two nerves would be adequate for surgical anesthesia.
Before the femoral nerve block, the pannus was taped cephalad as the fatty tissue hanging from the abdomen made it difficult to access the inguinal region. The femoral nerve was identified at a depth of 5 cm with a linear US probe (Esaote, 10–18 MHz, Florence, Italy). Fifteen mL (8 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine and 7 mL of 2% lidocaine) of local anesthetic mixture was administered around the femoral nerve using the in-plane approach. Due to the difficulties in situating the patient in the prone position, the distal extremities of the patient were elevated with folded blankets in the supine position (). The sciatic nerve could not be visualized despite several attempts using both linear and convex probes; therefore separate blocks of the tibial and common peroneal nerves were planned. The tibial nerve was identified in the popliteal fold, posterior to the popliteal artery at a depth of 3 cm (). Visualization of the tibial nerve was highly difficult in areas more proximal than the point 2 cm above the popliteal fossa. The common peroneal nerve (CPN) and the bifurcation of the sciatic nerve could not be visualized despite several attempts using both linear and convex probes. Therefore, 10 mL (7 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine and 3 mL of 2% lidocaine) of local anesthetic mixture was administered around the tibial nerve 2 cm above the popliteal fold by using a linear probe. Screening was performed in the distal direction over the lateral side of the patient's leg with the linear probe placed transversely on the edge of the patella to identify the CPN (). The nerve was visualized posteriorly and laterally to the fibular head, 4 cm distally to the edge of the patella at a depth of 2 cm (). At this level, 10 mL (7 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine and 3 mL of 2% lidocaine) of local anesthetic mixture was administered around the nerve with the in-plane technique using a linear probe. A 100 mm 21-G echogenic needle (Pajunk, Geisingen, Germany) was used for all blocks. A nerve stimulator was not used for any blocks since the patient had extremity pain associated with trauma. Surgical anesthesia was established within 30 minutes after anesthetic administration and no complications occurred in association with the blocks. Emergent reduction and fixation with an external fixator were performed for the ankle dislocation and fracture of the tibia. Additional local anesthetic injection or additional sedation was not required during the operation. The operation lasted for approximately 1.5 hours and was completed without problems. The patient's consent was obtained for the publication of this case report.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 35-year-old man was hospitalized after a 10-year history of occipitocervical pain and limited mobility (Fig. ). Physical examination revealed mild tenderness in the back of the upper cervical vertebrae and limited mobility of the neck. The muscle strength of the limbs was grade 4, and there was slight loss of limb and trunk sensation. Excretory function was normal. Pathological reflexes were positive, and bilateral patellar tendon reflexes were hyperactive. Cervical anteroposterior and lateral plain radiography, cervical computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an occipitocervical junction deformity accompanied by spinal cord compression. Occipitocervical deformity was diagnosed. On the fifth day after admission, the patient underwent a corrective operation involving posterior reduction and occipitocervical fixation and fusion. The bone graft comprised both ilium and artificial bone.
The standard occipitocervical posterior midline approach was adopted to expose the posterior structures of the C0–C3 vertebrae. Care was taken to protect the vertebral artery and posterior vascular plexus. Intraoperative fluoroscopy revealed that the occipitocervical joint sequence was good, and the reduction was successful. Screw insertion was a three-step process. First, occipital screws were inserted in the mediolateral tubercle and the occipital protrusion of the occipital bone (total of three occipital screws) []. Second, pedicle screws were inserted bilaterally in C2 using the Harms and Melcher technique [], and lateral mass screws were inserted bilaterally in C3 using the Roy–Camille et al. technique []. Third, an additional spinous process screw (3.5 mm diameter, 20 mm long) was inserted vertically into C2 []. The depth and angle of its implantation was determined using the Goel and Kulkarni technique [], and the screw itself was chosen according to its length and diameter based on the patient’s appearance on preoperative CT scans. Following screw insertion, three rods were then connected from C0 to C3. An occipital screw was placed in the occipital protrusion and connected to the C2 spinous process screw. A high-speed drill was used to prepare the bone graft bed on the posterior structure of the occipitocervical joint. The graft comprised bone from the posterosuperior ilium and artificial bone.
The patient could walk with a neck brace on postoperative day 3 and continued wearing the neck brace for the next 3 months. No neurovascular complications or incision infection were observed during the 24-month follow-up. Postoperative radiography showed that the internal fixation remained stable. Successful fusion was confirmed 4 months after the operation. Postoperative MRI showed that the occipitocervical decompression was sufficient, and there was no obvious spinal cord compression. The muscle strength of the limbs was grade 5, and at the 24-month follow-up visit the patient’s sensation function had improved from its preoperative state (Fig. ).","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 67-year-old male presented to the outpatient clinic with a chief complaint of ambulatory difficulty and a history of an ankle fracture and deformity. The patient's daughter reported that her father sustained an ankle fracture 6 weeks ago and was hospitalized. The history revealed that the patient was placed in a short-leg cast and surgery was considered but not performed since the ankle mortise was reduced at that time and the patient's ankle displayed multiple fracture blisters. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility during which time the cast was removed secondary to non-compliance and skin compromise. The patient's daughter stated that her father was fully ambulatory at 2 weeks after the initial injury despite medical advice. Unfortunately, he was unaware of his ankle fracture since he suffered from dementia and Alzheimer's disease. His medical history was also significant for poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, prior alcohol abuse, seizures, aortic stenosis, meningioma, and hypertension. A physical examination revealed a well-nourished individual who was in no acute distress and was alert but not oriented to time, person, or place. His vital signs were stable. The left lower extremity was edematous with a non-infected necrotic wound over the medial malleolus. The ankle and rearfoot displayed severe valgus deformity with the medial malleolus causing pressure necrosis to the overlying soft tissue. He had weakly palpable pulses and loss of protective sensation when examined with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament. Radiographic evaluation revealed a displaced fibula fracture with significant ankle joint subluxation and widening of the medial clear space (). The patient was admitted to the hospital and stratified as moderate risk for surgical intervention after optimized by both internal medicine and cardiology.
Non-invasive vascular studies that consisted of ankle-brachial index, toe-brachial index, and pulse volume recordings demonstrated moderate arterial occlusive disease with a falsely elevated ankle-brachial index secondary to calcified vessels. The patient was then evaluated by vascular surgery and after angiography was performed, adequate collateral circulation was present and their recommendation was to proceed with appropriate surgical intervention. The patient was brought to the operating room after obtaining informed consent from his daughter, as he was deemed not competent to make his own medical decisions. The patient underwent operative intervention that consisted of ORIF of his fibula fracture with placement of multiple pro-syndesmotic screws and application of a multi-plane circular external fixator. Postoperatively, the patient was permitted to fully weight-bear with the external fixator and discharged to a rehabilitation facility. The patient developed a postoperative infection that was evident 3 weeks after surgery, as wound dehiscence and drainage were apparent. The patient was readmitted to the hospital for inpatient care. The patient was brought back to the operating theater during this admission for an incision and drainage of the ankle wound with collection of deep intra-operative soft tissue cultures and reclosure of the wound over a drain. The drain was removed at 72 h and then wet to dry dressings were applied daily until the wound was healed. Deep intra-operative cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The patient was initially placed on parenteral administration of Vancomycin but was switched to oral administration of Zyvox after the first week as the patient continued to remove his peripherally inserted central catheter line. His antibiotic regimen was continued 6 weeks for treatment of deep infection with retained hardware. The patient healed his wound at 6 weeks postoperatively and was full weight-bearing with the external fixator for 12 weeks total time.
The external fixator was removed and the patient was placed into a walking total contact cast for a total of 6 weeks with cast changes performed at 2 week intervals. The patient was able to resume full ambulatory status with prefabricated extra-depth diabetic shoes with soft inlays at 18 weeks postoperatively. The patient continued to maintain an ambulatory status with no further complications at his 8-month follow-up ().","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 26-year-old female with CF (genotype F508del/F508del), with a baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 21% predicted and a 6-l home oxygen requirement, was undergoing evaluation for bilateral lung transplantation. Her medical history included recurrent respiratory infections with multi-drug resistant pathogens, pancreatic insufficiency, malnutrition requiring percutaneous gastrostomy feeds, atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia status post ablation, and the recent delivery of a healthy baby. She had no history of biliary tract stones, cirrhosis, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C. As part of the lung transplantation workup a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a new peripherally enhancing 6.3 cm mass in the right lobe of her liver, and subsequent MRI suggested intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. At this time, the patient reported feeling a hard mass under her right ribs along with intermittent right upper quadrant pain and fullness, anorexia, weight loss, and daily subjective fevers for several weeks.
Ultrasound-guided biopsy identified the mass as an adenocarcinoma, with positive staining for cytokeratin 7 (CK7), GATA-3, a transcription factor important in the regulation of certain genes, and p40, a marker of squamous differentiation. Notably, the tumor was negative for estrogen receptor (ER), thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), cytokeratin 20 (CK20), and high risk human papillomavirus ribonucleic acid in situ hybridization (HR HPV RNA ISH), and therefore did not support tumor origin of breast or gynecologic, lung, lower gastrointestinal, or cervical or head/neck, respectively. Serum tumor markers demonstrated normal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, but a markedly elevated carbohydrate antigen (CA)19–9 level of 5949.5 U/mL (0–36 U/mL), which can be elevated in pancreatic, gastric, hepatobiliary, and colonic malignancies. Given the tumor location, serum markers, and pathology findings, the tumor was thought to be most consistent with a primary cholangiocarcinoma.
The patient underwent complete staging following hospital discharge, where radiation therapy with curative intent was recommended. Ultimately her poor performance status, chronic pulmonary disease, and risk of severe life-threatening infection influenced the decision not to pursue systemic chemotherapy or surgery as the initial treatment modality. However, prior to starting treatment, she developed pneumonia leading to acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. A second CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (4 weeks from the initial CT) revealed the liver mass had grown to 13.6 × 10 cm and there were patchy pulmonary consolidations concerning for both pneumonia and metastatic disease. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan demonstrated uptake in the lungs bilaterally, mediastinal lymph nodes, right iliac, and right femur, consistent with metastatic disease. Given her critical condition, it was decided she was no longer a candidate for treatment of her cancer. She was transitioned to home hospice where she passed away approximately 10 weeks after the initial CT.
Autopsy revealed a 20 × 17 × 23 cm tan mass in the right lobe of the liver (Fig. a and b), consistent with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (Fig. c), along with metastatic deposits in the heart/epicardium (Fig. d), bilateral lungs (Fig. e), anterior/posterior cul-de-sacs, left ovary, vaginal adventitia, spleen, diaphragm and bone marrow (Fig. f).
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma can resemble adenocarcinomas from other sites, and because there are no histologic markers that can reliably make the distinction, it is often difficult to distinguish them from metastatic tumors []. Due to a lack of a dominant tumor at other possible primary sites at autopsy, and a morphology showing anastomosing glands in a fibrotic stroma with focal squamous differentiation, cholangiocarcinoma was favored in this case.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 58-year-old male presented with increasing dyspnea following MI. He had thready pulse and blood pressure of 86/34 mmHg on dobutamine and adrenaline infusion at 10 and 0.1/μg/kg/min, respectively. His peripheral oxygen saturation was 88% on high flow oxygen with widespread bilateral lung opacities on chest X-ray. Blood investigations showed hemoglobin 13.5 g/dl, blood urea 142 mg/dl, serum creatinine 2.3 mg/dl, random blood sugar 170 mg/dl, serum sodium 128 meq/1, and serum potassium 5.1 meq/1. Urgent coronary angiography revealed blockade of left anterior descending (LAD) 90%, circumflex 50% and the total occlusion of right coronary artery (RCA). The RCA occlusion was stented successfully during the procedure. The transthoracic echocardiography showed left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) 20% and a large posterior-inferior ventricular septal defect (VSD) with a shunt gradient of 48 mmHg. Mechanical circulatory support was initiated with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and as he was deteriorating rapidly, the decision was taken to perform an urgent operation with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a backup support.
General anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl/propofol in slow titrated dosage, and endotracheal intubation was facilitated with cisatracurium. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was consistent with preoperative TTE finding. Anaesthesia was maintained on propofol and cisatracurium infusion with supplemental midazolam, fentanyl boluses, and sevoflurane. The patient required O2:Air (80:20) to maintain oxygenation with increasing requirement for inotropic and vasoconstrictor support. We decided to go for immediate central cannulation and subsequent cardiopulmonary bypass following anaesthetic induction. Our main aim was to decrease the shunt, prevent hypoxia and to provide an early organ support. The VSD was approximately 3.5 cm in diameter repaired by a bovine pericardial patch, and the friable ventriculotomy was closed using interrupted pledgeted stitches. The coronary artery bypass graft was performed to artery LAD using left internal thoracic artery and venous graft to its diagonal branch. Postoperative TEE showed no residual VSD, and as expected, he was unable to wean from bypass machine. We decided to continue him on central ECMO support to decrease the tension on VSD pericardial patch during immediate postbypass period.
Postoperatively, he required venovenous hemofiltration and the central ECMO switched over to peripheral with femoral cannulation after 72 h. He was eventually weaned from ECMO and IABP support on day 6 and required 43 days stay in cardiac rehabilitation facility and continued to do well following discharge and subsequent follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission. Exclusion Criteria: Individuals under 18 years of age, COVID-19 infection, Infection of the skin at the CGM site requiring removal of the sensor, Patients with altered Mental Status, Patients unable to scan their flash CGMs at least every 8 hours, Inability to provide written consent, Hospitalized for less than 24 hours.",0.5
"A 69-year-old male with underlying hypertension was admitted with a complaint of general weakness started 10 days ago. The patient had been taking irbesartan 150 mg and thiazide 12.5 mg for 3 years. He had 20 pack-year history of smoking. The initial blood pressure was 128/82 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the temperature was 36℃. Chest auscultation revealed decreased breathing sound on the left upper area of chest wall.
Laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count, 8,190×109/L; hemoglobin, 16.4 g/dL; platelet count, 170×109/L; glucose level, 235 mg/dL; sodium, 141 mEq/L; potassium, 1.7 mEq/L; chloride, 88 mEq/L; lactic dehydrogenase, 863 U/L; D-dimer, 0.08 µg/L; and C-reactive peptide, 2.30 mg/L. Arterial blood gas analysis was pH 7.574, pCO2 50.1 mm Hg, pO2 122 mmHg, HCO3 40 mmol/L, and oxygen saturation was 98.8% suggesting metabolic alkalosis.
The chest radiography taken on admission showed left upper lobe atelectasis and mass like lesion infiltrating the left upper bronchus (). Chest computed tomography (CT) scans revealed about 7×5-cm-sized mass in left upper lobe showing invasion to the main pulmonary arterial trunk (). Biopsy was done with bronchoscopy and the pathology confirmed small cell carcinoma. Positron emission tomography CT showed hepatic and both adrenal gland metastases.
Our primary impression was hyperaldosteronism or pseudohyperaldosteronism according to the lab finding of hypokalemia associated with hypertension. Aldosterone and renin level being normal, hypokalemia with metabolic alkalosis in patient with lung cancer infiltrating left upper lobe suggested Cushing syndrome due to ectopic ACTH secreting tumor. The ACTH level was elevated to 535.61 pg/mL and the cortisol level was elevated to 47.43 µg/dL. The level of cortisol was not suppressed with low dose and high dose dexamethasone suppression test and the 24-hour urinary free cortisol was still elevated to 1,796.93 µg/day. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed normal pituitary gland and no cerebral metastases. The malignant tissue obtained with bronchoscopy was positive in ACTH marker stain. These finding were consistent with Cushing syndrome caused by ectopic ACTH production (). The patient had no cushingoid appearance such as moon face, skin change or central obesity, and hypokalemia was the only clinical feature to suspect diagnosis.
To reduce the high cortisol level before chemotherapy, ketoconazole (400 mg two times a day) and spironolactone were administered for EAS. As hypokalemia resolved, so did the metabolic alkalosis. It was not needed to maintain corticosteroid treatment after normalization of hypokalemia. Once ectopic ACTH production controlled, the patient was transferred to the oncology division to have systemic chemotherapy and survived for 15 months.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year. Exclusion Criteria: Younger than 65 years old, having decompensated liver disease, psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance, having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy.",0.5
"The 71-year-old Caucasian male subject without any comorbidity participated in the Dutch section of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC). This study has been ongoing for almost 15 years in 8 European countries and aims to explore the feasibility of population-based screening for prostate cancer []. Almost 270.000 men have been randomized to the screening or control group. Prostate biopsy indications have changed during the course of the study, but include abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) and/or transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) findings, and/or elevated levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the blood serum and/or PCA3 (Prostate Cancer Gene 3) in the urine [].
In October 2007 our patient was screened using a measurement of the PSA serum level. His PSA was with 1.2 ng/ml below the biopsy-threshold of 3.0 ng/ml. However, as this man had also consented in participating in the PCA3 side study, his urinary sample (collected after DRE) was subjected to PCA3 analysis, which resulted in a score of 13. Since a threshold of PCA3 > 10 was used as a biopsy indication, this prompted DRE, TRUS, and lateralised sextant TRUS-guided prostate biopsies [].
No abnormalities were found during DRE and TRUS. Prostate volume measured by planimetric calculation was 30.9 cc. Histopathologic evaluation revealed no prostate cancer in the 6 biopsy-cores. However, in 2 of the 3 needle-biopsies that also contained rectal mucosa (number IV and V; taken from the left lateral side of the basis and middle of the prostate), a carcinoid was coincidentally found in the rectal mucosa. Small nests, glands and strands consisting of epithelial cells were present within the rectal muscularis mucosae (Figure ). These epithelial cells were characterised by an eosinophilic, finely granular cytoplasm, a round nucleus and inconspicuous nucleolus. No significant atypia, mitotic activity or necrosis was encountered. Additional immunohistochemical stainings showed strong expression of chromogranin and synaptophysin compatible with a carcinoid/low-grade neuroendocrine tumour. Molecular investigation eliminated the option of mixing of specimens.
Our patient was informed about the benign outcome of his prostate biopsies and the remarkable finding in the rectal mucosa by the principal investigator of the ERSPC and he was advised to make an appointment with the gastroenterologist. Besides constipation, no complaints of the gastroenterologic tract or lab changes were found. A colonoscopy was performed, during which two polyps were seen, the first at 2 cm from the anus and the second at 90 cm. The carcinoid was not detected during colonoscopy, probably because it was located in the submucosa. Both polyps were removed endoscopically and sent in for pathologic examination. The lesion in the rectum was a tubulovillous adenoma with low-grade dysplasia. The second was a hyperplastic polyp without any adenomatous changes. Because of the first finding, the patient was advised to undergo a control colonoscopy after 6 years. Until today the incidental finding of carcinoid did not have any clinical consequences for this patient.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"Patient III was a 70-year-old man who experienced right shoulder pain for >3 months with no history of trauma. There was no noticeable improvement following intra-articular corticosteroid injection 1 month before. Subjective pain on the VAS was 5 at rest and 8 during motion. On physical examination, the empty-can test was positive. US demonstrated substantial effusion of the long biceps tendon and SASD bursa with a full-thickness tear of the supraspinatus and subscapularis tendon (Fig. C). MRI revealed a full-thickness tear along the supraspinatus and subscapularis tendon with SASD bursitis. With US guidance, 9 mL of clear bursal fluid was aspirated, and a triamcinolone mixture was injected. All laboratory results, including bursal fluid levels were within normal limits. At 1 month, his pain score on the VAS decreased from 5 to 3 at rest and from 8 to 4 during motion; follow-up US revealed diminution of the previously noted bursal distension (Fig. D). His pain scores at 2 months were approximately at the same level as that at 1 month; follow-up US revealed increased bursal distension compared to the previous US finding but fluid accumulation was slightly decreased compared to the initial US finding (Fig. E).","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8. Exclusion Criteria: Patients with pre-existent terminal renal insufficiency, Known glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (risk of hemolysis), History of urolithiasis, oxalate nephropathy or hemochromatosis, Treatment limitations.",0.5
"A 15-year-old male, presented with fever, nausea, and three weeks of worsening right upper quadrant pain, preceded by three months of vague upper abdominal pain. Review of systems was otherwise normal. The patient had no travel history. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the abdomen and pelvis showed an 18-cm heterogeneous hepatic mass as well as several pulmonary nodules (Figure , ).
Given the patient’s history and the morphology of the lesion, an infectious process was initially suspected. A set of blood cultures was obtained, and serological tests including Entamoeba histolyticaantibody, serum (RIDASCREEN Entamoeba histolytica IgG, R-Biopharm AG, Darmstadt, Germany); Echinococcus antibody, IgG, serum (RIDASCREEN Echinococcus IgG, R-Biopharm AG, Darmstadt, Germany); and fungal antibodies by immunodiffusion were sent to Mayo Medical Laboratories. Initial complete blood count and blood chemistry results revealed elevated leukocytes (16,200/mm3), thrombocytes (536,000/mm3), bilirubin (2.1 mg/dL), lactate dehydrogenase (531 IU/L), gamma glyamyltransferase (119 U/L), and alkaline phosphatase (268 U/L), with normal liver transaminases and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Due to suspicion of a pyogenic or amoebic liver abscess, the patient was started on ceftriaxone and metronidazole.
A CT-guided needle biopsy of the liver mass taken the next day was positive for malignant cells by hematoxylin and eosin staining; however, surrounding fluid was negative for infectious agent by culture. A second set of blood cultures continued to show no growth, and antibiotics were discontinued. Subsequent laparoscopic liver biopsy (Figure ) led to the diagnosis of undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma, but was negative for any infectious agent. The pathology report indicated markedly pleomorphic cells with brisk mitotic activity with no differentiation and areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for alpha-I-antitrypsin, vimentin, and desmin; weakly positive for OSCAR focal pancytokeratin; and negative for actin and hepatocyte specific antigen; together, this was most consistent with embryonal sarcoma. The presence of lung nodules suggested stage IV metastatic disease; however, these were not biopsied.
The ELISA serological results for infectious diseases, completed after the malignancy was confirmed by biopsy, were positive for antibodies against Echinococcosis and Entamoeba histolytica, and the fungal antibody panel was positive for Histoplasma. Subsequent specific testing for Histoplasma antibody via complement fixation and immunodiffusion was negative. These confounding positive antibody results were thought to be a false positive due to a cross-reaction with the patient’s hepatic mass; as all cultures taken throughout including blood, needle biopsy, and wedge biopsy were negative.
The patient received four cycles of chemotherapy, consisting of ifosfamide and doxorubicin, followed by surgical resection of the residual tumor. Four months after his initial diagnosis, the patient underwent right hepatic trisegmentectomy along with resection of the right hemidiaphragm and mesh reconstruction. A magnetic resonance imaging scan 10 months after his initial admission revealed no evidence of disease, as did a follow-up CT scan of the chest taken 13 months after admission.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"The patient was a 45-year-old man who presented with a headache for 3 months which was progressive and had been intolerable for 2 weeks. However, the patient was a football player with good health. There was no such family history and family members were perfectly well. There were no other clinical symptoms reported by the patient.
The patient was advised to do CT-scan and MRI. Interestingly both CT-scan and MRI revealed brilliantly enhancing left lateral ventricular lesion with unilateral hydrocephalus (). T1 Image axial view postcontrast () and precontrast film () were also examined. T1 image of coronal view in postcontrast film was also evaluated (). T2 image in sagittal view () also found the SOL.
Flare image () was examined as well. All other investigations were within normal limit. Then the patient was advised for surgery for removal of the lesion. In this context, left parietal craniotomy was performed with total removal of the lesion through intraparietal approach. Reversal from GA and the postoperative period was uneventful and the patient had got rid of clinical symptom completely after surgery.
The tumor was well defined preoperatively and was removed under microscopic surgery meticulously. The patient was very poor to bear the cost of postoperative CT-scan and hence it was not done. The biopsy was sent for histopathological examination. The lesion was nearly spherical measuring 3.0 cm + 2.5 cm, whitish, and firm.
There was no evidence of necrosis. Microscopy revealed multicystic appearance with cyst lined by columnar epithelium with apical mucin. Few goblet cells were seen. Few areas had shown pseudostratified lining epithelium with nuclear hyperchromasia, nuclear enlargement, and increased mitosis.
There was no evidence of stromal invasion. The mucinous material was seen within the lumen. Hemosiderin laden macrophages were present in the stroma. It was confirmed as a lateral ventricular enterogenous cyst. Then the patient was well in around one year. After about one year of the surgical removal of the lesion, there was a recurrence of a headache whose intensity was more than the previous one.
Then the patient was advised to do a CT-scan which revealed lesion of the same pattern in the same location as before (). The patient was reexplored surgically and the tumor was removed completely through the same route and histopathology was again revealed it as a case of the enterogenous cyst. Again the total removal of the lesion from the brain was confirmed by postoperative CT-scan. Then the patient was advised for radiotherapy. After completion of radiotherapy, the patient was perfectly well at 13th postoperative month ().","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"In 2004, a 66-year-old man was diagnosed with a papillary grade 2 nonmetastatic right renal cancer and was treated with radical right nephrectomy. A nonspecific 10 mm-diameter tumor was detected on his left kidney, and hence, he was placed under close surveillance. In 2005, a partial left nephrectomy was performed but no pathological signs of malignancy could be evidenced. In 2006, the patient was diagnosed with a prostatic adenocarcinoma, and hence, a radical prostatectomy was performed without any complication. A few months later, multiple suspect left renal lesions were identified and a left radical nephrectomy was recommended by the multidisciplinary urologic board after meeting. Pathological analyses revealed a papillary renal cancer. The patient underwent hemodialysis 3 days a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) after bilateral complete nephrectomy and was closely monitored. Hemodialysis was performed between 2007 and 2010 without any complications. In 2010, a 70 mm local recurrence was diagnosed in the left renal fossa bed. Biopsies were performed, evidencing a recurrence of the papillary renal cancer. Since complete resection was impossible and in agreement with patient’s nephrologists, sunitinib was initiated in August 2010. For the first cycle, the smallest recommended dose of sunitinib was administered (ie, 37.5 mg/day). Sunitinib cycles consisted of 28 days on and 14 days off treatment. All along sunitinib administration, blood pressure was monitored weekly. He was considered to be stable and did not require treatment initiation.
Grade 3 vomiting occurred during all hemodialysis sessions performed following the first sunitinib initiation. Anticipatory nausea/vomiting was not suspected since the patient was not reported to be anxious and anxiolytic treatments did not decrease the symptoms. However, the 14 days treatment break was associated with a complete resolution of nausea and a related-to-sunitinib side effect was suspected.
Ondansetron was prescribed during the whole second cycle of sunitinib, but grade 1–2 vomiting during hemodialysis sessions was still reported. Digestive symptoms ceased again during the sunitinib off period.
Because of a grade 2 thrombocytopenia, the third cycle was delayed and the sunitinib dose was reduced to 25 mg/day. Despite the dose reduction and ondansetron systematic administration, grade 1 vomiting under hemodialysis was systematic during the sunitinib administration. Vomiting only stopped after sunitinib was replaced with another TT because of disease progression after three sunitinib cycles.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"82-year-old male patient was admitted to hospital with the complaint of altered mental status in July 2014. In April 2014, he was taken to hospital because of traffic accident. Computerized tomography (CT) was performed and it revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage. He was followed up at neurosurgery clinic. He was operated on because of left tibia fracture and discharged with full recovery two weeks later. He was admitted to neurosurgery clinic again with the complaints of vertigo, nausea, and vomiting in June 2014. CT revealed chronic subdural hematoma and subdural hygroma. At the same day, he was immediately operated on and haematoma was evacuated. He was discharged ten days later. Then he was admitted to neurosurgery clinic again with altered mental status in June 23, 2014. Physical examination revealed no pathological findings except disorientation. Laboratory tests revealed leucocyte 7.8 K/μL, hemoglobin 10.8 g/dL, platelet 252 K/μL, procalcitonin 0.26 ng/mL, and CRP 8.18 mg/dL. Urine tests revealed pyuria and urine culture was performed. Brain CT was performed and bilateral subdural hematoma was noted. On the second day of admission dyspnea occurred, and he was intubated and transferred to neurosurgery intensive care unit. Thorax CT was performed; an air cyst in right lobe, bronchiectasis, and a consolidated area in left lobe were noted. Piperacillin/tazobactam therapy was initiated empirically. On the third day, transtracheal aspirate sample was sent to microbiology laboratory. Antimicrobial therapy was modified to ertapenem after urine culture yielded ESBL (+).
E. coli and C. indologenes were isolated from transtracheal aspirate sample. Antimicrobial susceptibility test revealed resistance to carbapenems and sensitivity to levofloxacin. Levofloxacin was added to antimicrobial therapy on the 6th day of admission. On follow-up, after the second day of therapy modification, improvement on blood gas parameters was observed and the patient was extubated. He was transferred to neurosurgery clinic and antimicrobial therapy continued. He was discharged on the 15th day of admission with cure.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"The patient was a thirty-year old clerk. She complained of an abnormal warm sensation in her left breast. She consulted her doctors regarding this problem, but was reassured that it was normal. Sixteen months later she noted a definite lump in her left breast, and an excision biopsy was done. The lump recurred two months later, and a similar procedure was performed. Both biopsies were reported as benign haemangiomas. The lesion recurred during the next two months and, this time, she approached our clinic. Physical examination revealed a mass which measured approximately 6 cm. She was advised mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction. She refused, but one month later, returned to our hospital with a haemorrhaging lesion in the left breast (). She was found to be pale, but was haemodynamically stable. She underwent radiological embolisation of the lesion. The angiogram showed a tumour blush that had feeding arteries from branches of the left internal mammary artery and lateral thoracic artery. Embolisation of the feeding vessels was done using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Post-embolisation images showed complete occlusion of these feeding vessels (). She later consented for mastectomy. The tumour was completely excised and was reported as a grade 2 angiosarcoma. Radiotherapy of the chest wall was given, and investigations showed multiple lung metastases and bone metastases. She, however, refused palliative chemotherapy. Five months after mastectomy, she returned with right hypochondrium pain and abdominal distension. On clinical examination, she was pale. Her haemoglobin was 6 g/dl with a platelet count of 83 x 109/L. The low platelet count could be attributed to continuing platelet consumption due to formation of thrombi in the vascular metastatic lesions. Her abdomen was found to be grossly distended, tense, and tender. The fluid thrill test was positive. CT scan of the abdomen revealed multiple liver metastases with free fluid in the peritoneal cavity. The main hepatic artery was successfully embolised. Palliation of symptoms was achieved with analgesics, repeated peritoneal tapping, and blood transfusions. The patient also developed minor local recurrence on the chest wall, which fortunately did not bleed. Seven months after treatment and 28 months after initial excision biopsy, she deteriorated rapidly and passed away.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"We evaluated a 4 years old girl, previously healthy, with no relevant family medical history. She was conducted to our clinic because of a submandibular lymphadenitis. A month before, during a 3 days fever period, a painful submandibular swelling was noted. Neck ultrasound (US) showed a 2-cm diameter lymphadenopathy with a conserved structure. Therapy with ibuprofen was then suggested. Because of symptoms persistence, a control US was repeated after 5 days. The lymph node was enlarged and presented a subverted structure, with hypoechogenic areas and an absent roundness index (Fig. ). Therapy with co-amoxiclav was immediately started at a dosage of 80 mg/kg/day for 6 days. Blood tests showed a slight increase in C-reactive protein values (53 mg/L; normal value <50 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (31 mm/h); serology for Cytomegalovirus confirmed a previous infection, while IgM for Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) were positive. Blood smear was normal. Tuberculin skin test resulted positive (10 mm infiltration diameter). QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-tube test and chest X-ray resulted negative.
Neck US performed after 20 days was unchanged. Therefore the girl was referred to our infectious disease unit for further investigations. At physical examination, a fixed right submandibular lymphadenopathy, with an elastic consistency, painless and with no superficial skin alterations was detected. No other significant clinical features were described. Blood tests showed no alteration in blood count, inflammatory markers, liver function, lactic dehydrogenase, coagulation. Francisella tularensis and Toxoplasma gondii serology were negative. EBV serology showed evidence of a past infection.
In the suspicion of an NTM lymphadenitis, antimicrobial therapy with clarithromycin (15 mg/kg/die), and rifampicin (20 mg/kg per day) was started. A magnetic resonance imaging showed a confluent lymphonodal pack inside the inferior pole of the right parotid gland (4 × 4.2 × 2.9 cm) that was enhanced after contrast medium infusion. The enhancement involved also the whole parotid gland parenchyma and the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid muscle.
Due to sudden enlargement of swelling, exeresis of the lymph node was performed. Bacterioscopic exam showed a positivity for acid-fast bacilli, and the histological examination evidenced a granulomatous inflammation. Culture from the biopsy grew a M. marseillense strain, identified using a commercial kit (Hain Genotype Mycobacteria CM, Hain Lifescience, Germany) and sequencing the spacer region interposed between 16S and 23S rRNA genes, as described previously []. Because of a slow healing up of the surgical scar, ethambutol (25 mg/kg/die) was added to the previous therapy. Antimicrobial treatment was well tolerated by the patient and no adverse effect were reported. Blood exams and clinical assessment were periodically performed in order to evaluate potential drug-induced toxicity. Therapy was finally stopped 2 months after surgery.
Periodical blood tests and neck US were performed. At 10 months follow up visit, no relapse was found and the surgical scar was completely healed.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 49-year-old right-handed AA woman with a past medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, schizoaffective, and conversion disorder presented to the UAB emergency room for evaluation of altered mental status after a witnessed seizure. There was no travel or contact exposure to COVID-19, and she had no symptoms of COVID-19. At presentation, she had an axillary temperature of 99.5F, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, heart rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 180/95 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The neurologic exam revealed lethargy and disorientation to time and place. There was no meningismus. CT head was normal. Continuous video EEG monitoring was obtained to rule out subclinical seizures and status epilepticus. Scalp EEG showed severe background slowing in the delta range and the presence of multiple seizures (approx. 4-6 every hour over the next 8 hours) emanating from the midline and left fronto-central regions (Figs. , ). Initially, there was a clinical correlate of facial twitching, head version to the right followed by a bilateral tonic–clonic seizure. In the latter half, there was electroclinical dissociation with the presence of only electrographic seizures. The patient was intubated and treated with multiple doses of lorazepam, levetiracetam, and propofol for sedation. Soon after arrival, the patient was tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) through a nasal swab specimen, which returned negative. MRI brain without contrast was unrevealing for any definitive pathology. Her clinical course over the next 36 hours improved significantly with resolution in status epilepticus, and she was extubated within 48 hours. A lumbar puncture was not performed due to rapid improvement, and excellent response to levetiracetam. However, within 72 hours of the initial presentation, the patient developed fever, shortness of breath, myalgias, and nonproductive cough. A repeat nasal swab RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 returned positive. She remained stable with a mild cough and was eventually discharged home on levetiracetam and recommendation to self-quarantine.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 64-year-old man was referred to our hospital with bulging of the sternal manubrium. He was otherwise asymptomatic. There was no antecedent history of Gardner syndrome, trauma or surgery. Physical examination revealed a firm, 3× 3 cm palpable sternal mass. The contrasted computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed a 4× 4 cm mass based on the sternal manubrium, with no apparent involvement of the mediastinal structures (Figure A and B). 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) revealed metabolically active areas around the manubrium, both sternoclavicular joints, and bilateral first sternocostal joints, which was suggestive of malignant tumor of the sternal manubrium. The patient refused to undergo preoperative fine-needle aspiration of the lesion. Thus the patient underwent a radical en bloc resection of the tumor and sternal reconstruction with autogenous rib grafts. At surgery, an expansile lesion involving the entire manubrium, both sternoclavicular joints, and bilateral first sternocostal joints was found. En bloc radical manubriectomy was performed including portions of the bilateral clavicles and first ribs. The specimen was removed 4 cm beyond the margin of the lesion. Then through a left anterior lateral incision, about 10 cm of the left fifth rib was harvested from the subperiosteum and carved into two parts with preservation of intact periosteum and pleura. Slots were cut into the ends of the two rib clips, bilateral clavicles, and the edge of the sternum using an electric drill. The two rib grafts were placed to form a T shape between the edges of the residual sternum and bilateral clavicles using rib nails, and then fixed with stainless steel wires. Histopathological examination revealed long fascicles of spindle-shaped cells with slight atypia arranged in a collagenous stroma, indicating a diagnosis of desmoid tumor (Figure A and B). The resection margins did not show any signs of neoplastic infiltration. Postoperative recovery was unremarkable and there were no complications. Three months postoperatively, computed tomography scan of the reconstructed chest showed neither instability of the chest wall nor evidence of tumor recurrence (Figure C). The patient has been free of disease for 46 months after surgery without any other treatment.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 55-year-old female presented with sudden onset of copious spontaneous CSF rhinorrhoea, which started 3 weeks ago noted on the right side. She denied history of headache, vomiting, blurring, visual disturbance, or head injury. The ophthalmoscopic examination revealed normal fundus exam, visual acuity, and field charting. The laboratory analysis of nasal discharge tested positive for CSF. The MRI cisternography was requested. The MRI was acquired in prone position. A moderate sized focus of CSF leakage was identified in the right cribriform plate [], which was seen continuing posteroinferiorly into moderate amount of CSF in the right ethmoid air cells []. The MRI also demonstrated a ballooned empty sella [], perioptic CSF distension [], and vertical tortuosity of the optic nerves [Figure –]. No intracranial mass was noted. Imaging diagnosis of IIH was suggested. CT scan showed a corresponding defect in the right cribriform plate []. The patient was referred for endoscopic/neurosurgical surgical repair. Surgery confirmed the site of leakage noted on MRI/CT and was repaired with fascia lata patch.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 60-year-old male experienced dimmed vision in his left eye for 3 days prior to his first visit. The patient negated any other symptoms, including pain and diplopia. He had a history of two previous occurrences of possible ON – 30 years ago in his left eye and some 10 years later in his right eye. The patient had a history of hypertension and was currently on antihypertensive drugs. No relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) was present at his first examination. BCVA was 0.65 in the right eye and 0.5 in his left eye. A fundus examination revealed an atrophic and excavated disc in his right eye. An optic disc edema was present in his left eye. Retina was normal in both eyes. Laboratory tests for sarcoidosis, syphilis, and giant cell arteritis were analyzed, including determination of HGB, blood count, serum calcium, ESR, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), and Wassermann reaction (WR). All tests were normal or negative. Visual field and color vision were analyzed 3 days later; visual field test showed arcuate inferior defects in both eyes, with equivalent neural capacity of 67% in his right eye and 58% in his left eye. A Sahlgren’s saturation test (SST) color vision test revealed a more defective color vision in his left (20) than in his right (15) eye.
An orbital MRI carried out 1 week later revealed increased signal intensity in the parts of the left optical nerve sheath, possibly indicating OPN. The MRI also showed increased signaling in the retrobulbar fat of the left eye. No increased swelling of the extraocular muscles was evident.
The patient received a course of prednisone, 60 mg/day, which was tapered over 1 month, at which time he was examined again. BCVA was 1.0 in the right eye and 0.65 in his left eye. The optic disc edema had subsided substantially since the last fundus examination 1 month earlier. He received a new course of prednisone, starting with 25 mg/day, which was tapered to 7.5 mg/day until his next visit 2 months later. His BCVA was 1.0 in his right eye and 0.65 in his left eye.
Visual field testing again showed arcuate inferior defects in both eyes and abnormal thresholds, with equivalent neural capacity of 69% in his right eye and 61% in his left eye. A new MRI showed a slight regression of the enhancement around the left optical nerve since the last MRI. The results of a fundus examination revealed a pale papilla in both eyes. He remained on 7.5 mg/day prednisone, which was tapered over 14 weeks. At a new consultation 4 months later, BCVA was 1.0 in the right eye and 0.5 in his left eye.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 26 year old South-Asian female, having irregular menstrual cycles but was otherwise healthy presented with fever to the accident & emergency unit with severe generalized myalgia and arthralgia. Clinical assessment revealed a tachycardia with a pulse rate of 108 b.p.m and an initial blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg, indicating shock. Clinical picture favored dengue fever with the classic repertoire of symptoms. Since the patient had taken mefenamic acid, a non steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) for myalgia for a few days, her complaint of fever for only one day at presentation suggested an erroneous timeline and a late presentation. Rest of the systemic examination was normal and clinically there was no evidence of leakage of fluid in the chest and abdomen on presentation. She was started immediately on an intravenous infusion of 0.9% saline. Preliminary whole blood analysis demonstrated a low haematocrit of 32% with a reduced haemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL (11–17) and a platelet count of 173 × 10 9/L (150–450). Despite fluid replacement her blood pressure declined to 80/40 mmHg with development of shock together with a reduction of the haematocrit to 29%. At this stage haemorrhagic shock was suspected on a background of NSAID usage. She was transfused with cross matched packed red cells urgently and stabilization of the haemodynamic parameters were noted with a borderline but stable blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg. Haematocrit also stabilized at 35%. An ultra sound scan failed to reveal either leakage of fluid into pleural cavity or the presence of ascitic fluid and intra-abdominal heaemorrhage. However the patient suffered heavy per vaginal bleeding which continued. She was observed in a high dependency setting and 8 hours after admission and clinical stabilization, she developed bradycardia, which was confirmed on electrocardiogram (ECG). In addition to sinus bradycardia, the ECG showed T wave inversions from V2- V5 (Figure ). Cardiac insult due to dengue virus infection was suspected, although creatine kinase-MB was normal and Troponin I remained negative. ECG was done serially to monitor the progression and on the second day of hospitalization revealed the occurrence of complete heart block with atrio-ventricular dissociation and a junctional rhythm with a short P-R interval (Figure ). Despite this, the blood pressure remained within acceptable safe limits. In view of satisfactory peripheral perfusion a clinical decision was made not to insert a temporary pacemaker, but to continue close observation for possible haemodynamic compromise occurring due to arrhythmia or worsening due to its presence.
Primary dengue virus infection was confirmed by the presence of positive IgM antibodies with negative IgG antibodies on day 2 of hospitalization. Platelet counts on day 2 of hospitalsation was 157 ×109/L(150–450), but haematocrit value started to rise to 42 and then 45 within a few hours, and clinical examination revealed a right sided pleural effusion which was confirmed on sonographic imaging with the presence of pleural fluid and additionally fluid in the hepatorenal pouch. Fluid resuscitation and replacement was carried out in accordance with the national guidelines on dengue management. Serum magnesium levels were within reference range, with a value of 2.07 mg/dL (1.58-2.55). Serum sodium and potassium values were within reference throughout her stay. Initial serum ionized calcium levels were found to be low normal with a value of 1.14 mmol/L(1.12-1.32) Subsequent ionized calcium levels were found reduced to a value of 1 mmol/L (1.12-1.32). In the background of ECG changes, hypocalcemia was corrected cautiously with intravenous calcium gluconate and the electrolytes were monitored regularly, though the cardiac rhythm remained unchanged. Post correction serum ionized calcium was 1.17 mmol/L and later 1.22 mmol/L (1.12-1.32). Two dimensional echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 50% with normal valves, normal sized atria and ventricles with no systolic wall motion abnormalities though myocardial depression was observed. Liver function tests revealed elevated enzymes. Aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase were 141U/L (<40) and 119 U/L (<40) respectively and later rose to the highest recorded value of 320 U/L(<40) and 187U/L (<40) respectively. Gamma GT was also elevated at 347.5 U/L (7–50). Total protein was normal with a value of 62.4 g/L (60–85) but albumin was marginally reduced to 30.9 g/L (35–54). The patient remained clinically stable but the persistence of bleeding prompted a blood picture analysis to identify and exclude features of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Blood picture revealed moderately low platelets and reactive lymphocytes but no features of DIC. However thromboelastography revealed hypocoagulation, platelet deficiency and fibrinogen deficiency. In light of low platelets (lowest nadir of 10x109/L) and continuous per vaginal bleeding 4 units of factor VII complex was given. Normal sinus rhythm was noted on day 5 of admission, though she remained bradycardic till the time of discharge from hospital.
The bleeding ceased and platelet counts rose gradually. The patient made good clinical recovery with the pleural effusion subsiding and vaginal bleeding ceasing. ECG showed resolution upon review two weeks later.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 54-year-old male was referred to local hospital with cough and expectoration in April 2018. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass in the left of the lung, with multiple mediastinal lymph node metastases (4L, 5 and 6 region). Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration result was consistent with adenocarcinoma. Staging evaluation in Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (Beijing, China) with CT, positron emission tomography- CT, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain conformed stage IIIB (T3N2M0) according to the UICC 7th edition TNM classification. The patient was given concurrent chemotherapy, consisting of 500 mg/m2 pemetrexed and 75 mg/m2 cisplatin on day 1 every 3 weeks for 2 cycles, and definitive thoracic radiotherapy of volumetric modulated arc therapy (95%PGTV 60.2Gy in 28 fractions. 95%GTV 50.4Gy in 28 fractions). The isodose lines of radiation dose distribution are showed in Figure . A CT scan of the chest indicated a partial response. Grade I esophageal toxicity, Grade II gastrointestinal toxicity, Grade I dermatological toxicity and Grade I myelotoxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0; CTCAE v4.0) were the side effects of the concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
However, 2 months after completing concurrent chemoradiotherapy, he developed progressive disease with enlargement of right inguinal lymph node. Biopsy of the inguinal lymph node was consistent with adenocarcinoma and the patient was administered docetaxel 75 mg/m2 on day 1, carboplatin AUC 5 on day 2 plus bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg on day 1 once every 3 weeks.
Eighteen days after 4 cycles, the patient presented a sudden onset of acute cough after drinking. Esophageal Barium meal revealed a TF. Gastroscopy showed an esophageal mucosa erosion to be 28 to 36 cm from the nostrils, in which a deep hole was observed (Fig. ). Then a jejunal feeding tube was placed for nutrition (Fig. ). Forty days after the placement, the patients suffered from lung infections by an unclosed TF and a covered esophageal stent was placed in the esophagus (Fig. ). The TF was managed with stents. Until now, 6 months after the event of TF, the patient was still in follow-up care without any complication related to the stent placement.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"An 83-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) with upper abdominal chest pain with newly deranged liver function tests (LFTs) and raised inflammatory markers. On examination, he was found to be tender in the right upper quadrant as well as in the epigastrium. His LFTs were as follows: unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin were both 26 and 14 µmol/L, respectively; ALP, GGT, ALT, and AST were 333, 557, 194, and 158 U/L, respectively. His white cell count was 13.9 × 109/L, and CRP was 105 mg/L. A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed due to his atypical presentation to the emergency department, which showed cholecystitis with a distended gallbladder containing a 21 mm solitary lamellated calcified calculus. This was then confirmed on abdominal ultrasound, which, in addition to the above findings, showed that there was no evidence of choledocholithiasis or biliary duct dilatation.
The patient underwent LC, performed by a senior surgical trainee with an intraoperative cholangiogram showing no filling defects in the biliary ducts and free flow of contrast into the duodenum. During the operation, the gallbladder was inadvertently opened whilst dissecting it from the liver bed, resulting in spillage of the large calculus. While retrieving the gallbladder specimen in an endoscopic bag, the spilled calculus was left inadvertently in the peritoneal cavity. The operator did not realize that the spilled stone was unretrieved. The patient made an uneventful, gradual recovery and was discharged on postoperative day 1. Macroscopic histopathology report revealed a partially opened gallbladder with no gallstone within the lumen, suggesting that the spilled large calculus was not retrieved from the peritoneal cavity. Microscopically, it was consistent with acute and chronic cholecystitis with muscle hypertrophy and fibrosis of the wall.
The patient re-presented to the emergency department 3 weeks after discharge with central abdominal pain, anorexia, and vomiting. He had been experiencing these symptoms since day 3 of discharge, and they had been getting worse until the time he re-presented. In spite of these symptoms, he was systemically well. Examination of the abdomen revealed minimally distended abdomen with tenderness in the periumbilical region. These symptoms and signs suggested that he had small bowel obstruction. However, in the setting of recent cholecystectomy, we wanted to rule out the possibility of a biliary injury. His LFTs and inflammatory markers were normal. His symptoms were further evaluated with a CT scan, which showed evidence of SBO with transition point in the right iliac fossa. The obstruction was from a laminated calcified structure applying extrinsic compression on a loop of small bowel. With the knowledge of the index operation and the pathology report of the retrieved specimen, it was suspected that this structure was the unretrieved gallstone. This calculus was associated with a surrounding phlegmon, evidenced by intense inflammatory change on the CT scan ().
The patient underwent laparoscopy in view of the CT scan findings. Laparoscopy identified a large phlegmon compressing on the distal ileum causing obstruction with distended proximal and collapsed distal small bowel loops (). Dissection of the phlegmon revealed a small abscess cavity and the unretrieved gallstone at its center (). The abscess was drained and the gallstone retrieved (), which resulted in a resolution of the small bowel obstruction. The patient made a gradual recovery and was subsequently discharged on postoperative day 4, at which point he was tolerating solid diet with return of normal gastrointestinal function.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 42-year-old previously healthy male was referred to our tertiary center complaining of high-grade fever accompanied by chills over the last 20 days. He also complained of progressively increasing breathlessness, nonproductive cough, and right-sided chest pain. There was no history of weight loss or abdominal pain. He denied smoking tobacco. On arrival at our center, he was found to be febrile and dyspneic. His pulse was 120/min, respiratory rate 28/min, and SP02 was 95% at room air. The systemic examination of the chest revealed decreased breath sounds in the right lower zone and coarse crackles in the right infrascapular region. No peripheral or deep chain lymphadenopathy was detected on physical or imaging examinations. The hematological workup showed a leukocyte count of 18,000/µl (reference range [RR]; 4000-12000/μL) with 80% polymorphs. Liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. The serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 1650 U/L (RR; 150-250U/L). The chest X-ray revealed a heterogeneous opacity in the right pulmonary lower lobe and pleural effusion, which showed to be hemorrhagic after diagnostic thoracocentesis (A). The computed tomographic (CT)-guided Tru-cut biopsy attempted in the original-attending hospital showed necrotic tissue. The thoracic CT scan after the second hospitalization revealed a well-defined irregularly, marginated, complex, non-enhancing mass in the right lung, likely pleural based with thickened visceral pleura causing collapse and consolidation of the right lung (B). The radiological differentials comprised malignant mesothelioma versus a synovial sarcoma.
A new CT-guided biopsy was attempted and showed atypical cells consistent with an underlying malignant lesion (A). The thoracocentesis revealed an exudative and hemorrhagic pleural effusion without malignant cells.
Meanwhile, the patient’s clinical condition deteriorated, he became tachypneic and developed puffiness of the face and altered sensorium and a clinical diagnosis of superior vena cava obstruction was made. He was kept on an antibiotic regimen with Piperacillin-Tazobactam, corticosteroids and controlled ventilation. Bedside 2D echocardiogram failed to evidence a pericardial tamponade, but the mass was seen compressing the right atrium and superior vena cava. On the eighth day of hospitalization, his general condition suddenly worsened, and he expired. Immediately. the autopsy was performed with the working diagnosis of a right lung mass with SVC syndrome, probably due to malignant mesothelioma or a high-grade sarcoma.
External examination revealed proptosis of eyes and midline shift of trachea to the left. On the opening of the chest cavity, the right hemithorax was replaced by a massive hemorrhagic and necrotic tumor mass, which was adherent to the chest wall. In comparison, on the left side, there were 25 ml of straw-colored pleural fluid noted with pleural sheen (A). The right lung weighed 1200 g (RR; 360-570 g), and Left lung weighed 550 g (RR; 325-480 g). The right lung was replaced by a large tumor, which was chiefly necrotic, hemorrhagic, and pulpy. Only a portion of the posterior segment of the middle lobe was noted to be intact. The tumor mass pushed the trachea to the left. The left lung was boggy and was oozing frothy blood-stained fluid. The cut section did not show any cavities, abscesses, or tumor deposits (B).
The liver was enlarged and weighed 1800 g (RR:1500-1800 g). The external surface was smooth and glistening. No nodularity was noted. The cut surface showed a nutmeg appearance suggestive of passive venous congestion. No mass lesion was identified.
The spleen was enlarged, and weighed 230 g (RR:150-200 g). External and cut surface showed congestion. Both kidneys, pancreas, stomach, intestines, heart and brain were externally and on cut sections unremarkable.
Histological examination of the lung depicted tumor cells in cohesive sheets, having a peritheliomatous arrangement amidst predominantly necrotic areas. The tumor cells were round to oval, had coarsely stippled chromatin with scant to mildly eosinophilic cytoplasm. Nucleoli were inconspicuous, and mitosis was brisk. Numerous apoptotic bodies were also noted (2C).
IHC reactions showed the tumor cells to be diffusely positive for Vimentin (strong cytoplasmic positivity), CD99 (strong membranous positivity), and FLI 1(strong nuclear positivity). The tumor cells were diffusely negative for calretinin, WT1, D240, synaptophysin, CD56, TTF1, Tdt, S-100, desmin, myogenin, BCL-2, LCA, and EMA. On Periodic Schiff stain (PAS), the cytoplasm of tumor cells showed strong magenta cytoplasmic positivity (AD). Sections from the left upper and lower lobe showed normal air-filled alveoli lined by type II pneumocytes.
No tumor deposits were seen. Sections from the right and left lobe of the liver showed features of passive venous congestion. No tumor deposits were noted. Sections from the spleen showed expansion of red pulp with attenuation of the white pulp. Final diagnosis was primary Ewing sarcoma of right lung causing SVC syndrome.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 54-year-old female patient presented to our clinic with complaints of occasional pain, numbness, and paralysis of her right hand. She began to notice weakness of her left hand that had begun 2 years earlier. She had no history of trauma and no family history of amyloid neuropathy. She had a history of ovarian tumor 25 years ago and thyroid tumor 5 years ago, both of which healed after surgical resection.
Physical examination revealed a mass 5 × 3 cm in the ulnar side of her left proximal forearm shown in Figure . The lesion was firm, nonpulsatile, and tender on palpitation. She had numbness on the ulnar side of her left hand and fingers. The 2-point discrimination test revealed that 15 mm at the lateral side of the ring finger 10 mm at the little finger. She had muscle weakness with abduction and adduction of the ring finger and the little finger, but no deficit in the range of motion in the elbow. The electrophysiological study revealed a significant decrease in the motor nerve conduction velocity of the ulnar nerve from distal to the mass to proximal to the mass. MRI revealed that the ulnar nerve was swollen longitudinally, had a spindle shape, and measured 3.0 × 2.7 cm in the axial plane and 7.2 cm longitudinally shown in Figure . The swollen lesion had a relatively homogeneous isosignal intensity on T1-weighted images and had relative heterogeneous enhancement after the intravenous administration of gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agent with the findings of flow void. Based on these findings, the differential diagnoses included a vascular malformation that surrounded and compressed the ulnar nerve. Excisional biopsy was not performed because of the risk of hemorrhage and iatrogenic nerve injury. The lesion was instead surgically explored with a longitudinal incision shown in Figure . The operative findings showed no vascular malformation; however, the ulnar nerve fascicles were swollen and degenerated. The affected lesion had changed into a yellow tissue shown in Figure . After the yellow tissue was carefully removed microscopically, approximately 7 cm defects remained between intact nerve fascicles. The resected tissue was hard and had a stick-like shape shown in Figure .
The histopathological examination showed degenerated connective tissue with diffuse eosinophilic deposition, which included calcification, ossification, and chondroid tissue shown in Figure and b. No intact nerve tissue remained. The deposit was positive for Congo red stain and appeared apple-green under polarized light, which suggested the diagnosis of amyloid neuropathy shown in Figure .
Immunohistochemical staining showed that the deposit was immunopositive for light-chain λ antibody shown in Figure . The deposit was immunonegative for amyloid A, transthyretin, and light-chain κ. Therefore, the pathological diagnosis was AL amyloidosis.
To determine the association with systemic involvement, we conducted screening examinations. Bone marrow aspiration, cerebrospinal fluid examination, echocardiography, electromyography of the legs, chest computed tomography, and MRI of the brain and legs showed negative results. Physical examination revealed no sign of macroglossia or purpura on the skin. Autonomic dysfunction, including orthostatic hypotension, was not present. The only positive results were from the blood test, which showed high serum levels of amyloid protein A (159.2 μg/mL [<8.0]).
Two months postoperatively, the patient underwent nerve transplantation for reconstruction of the ulnar nerve. The sural nerve was sacrificed from the left lower leg and transplanted to the defect of the ulnar nerve. One year postoperatively after the nerve transplantation, she had no apparent evidence of metastasis or local recurrence. There was no recovery of numbness in the ring and little finger and the muscle weakness still had no recovery.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 62-year-old male with past medical history of type 2 DM (DM-2) and hypertension of 20 years presented to our emergency room with progressive dyspnea that had worsened gradually over the last three months. He was being treated in another facility with questionable diagnosis of congestive heart failure with incomplete response to diuretic therapy. There was no history of chest pain, cough, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He was a nonsmoker and had used alcohol occasionally. There was no recent viral or flu-like illness. On careful questioning, he complained of difficulty in walking and weakness in his legs. The patient denied any back pain, fever, weight loss, bladder involvement, or pain and paresthesias in his extremities. Neurological examination revealed bilateral symmetric muscle weakness with power of 4/5 in upper proximal and distal extremities and 3/5 in lower proximal and distal extremities. There was no ptosis or gaze paresis. Cranial nerves I–XII were grossly intact. There was no evidence of atrophy of the hand muscles and fasciculations. Sensory exam revealed decreased pinprick sensation distal part of extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were graded one in both upper and lower extremities. His blood pressure on admission was 161/106 mm Hg. A fasting blood glucose done at emergency room triage was 229 mg/dL. The clinical and functional examinations did not correlate with the severity of dyspnea. Arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed respiratory insufficiency (pO2 of 60 mm Hg, pCO2 of 58 mm Hg, and SaO2 of 89%).
Initially, chest radiograph was obtained which revealed normal lung fields with no evidence of fluid overload. Serum electrolytes and thyroid panel were found to be normal. β-natriuretic peptide level and 2-D echocardiogram results were inconsistent with heart failure. Adequate glycemic control was achieved with insulin, and serial ABGs remained unchanged on day 1. As the diagnosis leaned towards neuromuscular involvement, bilevel positive alveolar pressure (BiPAP) was started which was followed by serial vital capacities and negative inspiratory pressure (NIP). CSF analysis narrowed the differential to demyelinating neuropathy, which proved to be inconsistent with Gullian-Barré syndrome. EMG analysis revealed sensorimotor polyneuropathy that was predominantly axonal and demyelinating in nature (). In the meantime, the patient's vital capacity dropped to 0.7 liters with NIP of −26 cm H2O. Anti-paraneoplastic antibody screening with ANA and anti-MAG levels were noncontributory. On day 4, the CSF culture was negative. As diabetic polyradiculopathy was considered the most likely diagnosis, intravenous immunoglobulin IVIg 0.4 g/kg/day was started for five days. The patient tolerated the treatment well and showed both subjective and objective improvement as assessed by serial ABGs, vital capacity, and NIP assessment (). The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center in stable respiratory condition with intermittent nasal oxygen insufflation and overnight BiPAP ventilation.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 58-year-old male with comorbidities of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and gastro-esophageal reflux disease was initially referred to the gastroenterology clinic by primary care physician for the surveillance colonoscopy, and evaluation of dark colored stools.
Patient noted dark colored stools during the Christmas weekend associated with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The abdominal pain was epigastric, gradual onset, severe in intensity, nonradiating, aggravated with emesis with no specific relieving factors. Denies any hematemesis. He had colonoscopy 10 years ago and had history of colonic polyps. At the time of assessment in the clinic he denied any nausea, vomiting, and worsening abdominal pain or other symptoms.
Physical examination of cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological system was unremarkable. Vitals were within normal limits. Recent laboratory workup showed hemoglobin of 14.7 g/dl with normal renal and hepatic parameters including normal albumin levels. He has past medical history of anemia and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and Colonoscopy which revealed arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). He also has history of Alcoholic pancreatitis, alcohol dependence, smoking but no history of any drug abuse. Family history was negative for the colon cancer and stomach cancer. For gastroesophageal reflux disease, he was prescribed PPIs as needed but he was not taking it regularly due to little or no relief from them.
For the evaluation of GI bleed, he underwent colonoscopy in January 2016 which showed normal ileum, few 2–4 mm hyperplastic polyps in the sigmoid colon, and few 3 mm polyps in the rectum which had reactive lymphoid aggregate and focal epithelial hyperplasia on biopsy. Other findings included diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon and in the descending colon and nonbleeding internal hemorrhoids. In January 2016 an EGD showed normal esophagus but enlarged gastric folds and erythematous mucosa in the antrum and stomach biopsy showed gastric antral mucosa with focal mild increase of eosinophils and congestion. Three nonbleeding angioectasias were seen in the duodenum which were treated with argon plasma coagulation (APC). Mucosa biopsies were negative for H. pylori infection. For evaluation of the AVMs, Small bowel enteroscopy was done on February 2016 which showed mucosal changes in the jejunum and biopsy revealed small bowel mucosa with dilated lymphatics. EGD was repeated for polypectomy in February 2016 which showed enlarged gastric folds and were ligated. There was normal duodenal bulb and mucosal resection was successfully performed. The biopsy was consistent with fundic gland polyps.
He was referred to the gastroenterology clinic after eighteen months for abnormal abdominal computerized tomography findings of gastric wall thickening which he had for abdominal pain. This epigastric pain was gradual in onset, severe in intensity, radiating to right upper quadrant, and progressively worsened. To rule out gastric malignancy, EGD and EUS were done. EGD in September 2017 showed giant gastric folds, much larger than seen on the prior endoscopies. This is shown in . The biopsied enlarged gastric folds revealed gastric fundic mucosa with foveolar hyperplasia, dilated fundic glands and chronic gastritis which is shown in . Another gastric fundus nodule biopsy revealed gastric fundic mucosa with foveolar hyperplasia and mild chronic inflammation.
With the background of thickened gastric folds and episodes of recurrent pancreatitis, the patient underwent upper endoscopy ultrasound for the evaluation of the pancreas as well as the stomach on March 2018 which showed wall thickening in the body of the stomach. The thickening appeared to be primarily within the submucosa (Layer 3) of the stomach (). There was no sign of significant pathology in the common bile duct, gall bladder, and the main pancreatic duct.
Stomach biopsy results were consistent with Menetrier disease. Patient was followed in the clinic and explained the risks of adenocarcinoma associated with this disease. Our patient has worsening of the disease in one and half years.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 15-year-old male patient visited the clinic due to vesiculopapular eruptions on the face and neck. He suffered from atopic dermatitis also from infancy, but it was abruptly aggravated during the past week. He received standard treatment thereafter showing persistent fluctuation. He received Histobulin therapy through 24 injections, and the clinical severity scores improved gradually from 26.1 to 14.2 after 24 Histobulin injections (Figure ). The MAST results showed that 2 allergens were positive (A alternata 100 <and Dp 2.40) before treatment and 2 allergens were positive (A alternata 100 <and Dp 2.40) after treatment. In the skin test, no allergens showed a positive reaction before or after treatment. The patient frequently suffered from URI 24 times per year (two times per every month), but he did not experience URI during or after treatment for a year.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"An 83 year old retired Caucasian lady was admitted to a UK hospital with a recent history of back pain without any trauma. She had no significant past medical history of note and her only regular medication included a statin for cholesterol. She was a non-smoker and drunk only minimal amounts of alcohol. X-rays on admission demonstrated severe osteoporosis with multiple collapsed lumbar vertebrae. Whilst awaiting a brace and social support she developed diarrhoea and vomiting. An initial stool sample was negative for clostridium difficile serotoxin. Over the next few days her clinical condition deteriorated and by day 6 her C-reactive protein was 357. She developed abdominal distension, pain and a plain x-ray showed centralised dilated small bowel loops. A subsequent CT scan of her abdomen revealed small bowel obstruction together with mural thickening of the distal ileum (see Figure ).
Following CT the patient developed signs of localised peritonitis and underwent a laparotomy. At surgery necrosis and ischaemia was seen in a large portion of mid-ileum together with large quantities of pus and a localised perforation. A small bowel resection of 60 cm was performed. Histology revealed an acute gangrenous ileitis. Blood, urine and stool cultures were all negative but reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of stool cultures revealed Norovirus genogroup II. Immunoassay of the stool was negative for rotavirus and adenovirus. No specific testing for astrovirus was performed. Immunological testing of the histological specimens was not performed.
The patient had no prior history of vascular disease to suggest the cause of the ileitis was ischaemic enterocolitis. Furthermore despite the patient's back pain she had been mobilising around her bed in the hospital therefore it is unlikely that the cause of the ileitis was paralytic ileus secondary to immobility. The patient received only as required opiate analgesia and this was co-administered with appropriate laxative cover to avoid constipation. A diagnosis of acute gangrenous ileitis secondary to Norovirus was therefore made. It was postulated that the virus had triggered a localised inflammatory response leading to necrosis which had continued despite clearing of the virus by host immune responses. The virus was thought to be a nosocomial infection as there was no recent history of foreign travel or contact with individuals demonstrating the symptoms of gastro-enteric disease prior to admission. However antibody testing for IgG and IgM was not performed therefore the length of infection with the virus was unclear.
Following surgery the patient developed a pelvic collection requiring CT guided drainage which matured into an enterocutaneous fistula. The fistula was treated conservatively and sealed spontaneously at 10 weeks at which point she was discharged.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A previously fit and well 20-year-old Moroccan man presented with a right orbital tumor measuring 2 cm in diameter that had been rapidly increasing in volume. A complete resection of the tumor was made. The diagnosis was made on histological examination, confirming the orbital tumor to be an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.
The patient received six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with alternating vincristine, adriablastine and cyclophosphamide(VAC). One year later, the patient developed a local recurrence. Exenteration was performed,followed by treatment with six cycles of ifosfamide plus etoposide (IE); local radiotherapy was also given at a dose of 45 Gy. However, after 6 months, the patient developed a cutaneous mass in the right lumbar region, which was resected. A computed tomography - scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis did not reveal any metastasis. Macroscopically, the tumor size was 4 × 4 × 2.2 cm; the cut surfaces were nodular and fleshy; there was no necrosis and the edges showed an infiltrative pattern. Histologic sections with microscopy showed a proliferation of undifferentiated round cells arranged in sheets with some tapered eosinophilic cytoplasm. High mitotic rate was seen. The tumor cells infiltrating the subcutaneous tissue. Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections revealed loosely arranged round cells with large hyperchromatic nuclei and rare strap cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm (Figures and ). Immunohistochemical studies were performed using antibodies directed against desmin,myogenin, cytokeratin and leukocyte common antigen(LCA).
Photomicrographs showing a sheet of undifferentiated round cells. The tumour cells were immunopositive for desmin (Figure ) and myogenin (Figure ), and negativity for cytokeratin and LCA. A final diagnosis of cutaneous RMS metastasis was made. The patient then was treated by chemotherapy with 6 cycles of IE. He is still living 9 months after the initial diagnosis of skin metastasis with no recurrence.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 68-year-old female patient with a past medical history of diffuse large B-cell (double hit) lymphoma, status post chemotherapy, as well as peripheral stem cell transplantation (PSCT) complicated by disseminated M. abscessus infection of the skin was referred to the gastroenterology clinic for evaluation of postprandial abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and melena. She had been recently started on clofazimine and tigecycline due to previous adverse effects from azithromycin. Two months before PSCT (November 2012), the patient developed a catheter-related blood stream infection with M. abscessus that was treated with catheter removal and initial therapy with oral azithromycin, levofloxacin, and amikacin. Two days later, levofloxacin was changed to amikacin after the organism was identified as M. abscessus and preliminary susceptibilities determined resistance to fluoroquinolones. The patient completed a 4-week course of antimicrobial therapy with azithromycin, imipenem, and amikacin complicated by amikacin-induced ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. The patient rapidly cleared the bacteremia within 48 hours after central venous catheter removal and had no other manifestations of infection. In January 2013, she underwent autologous PSCT and within 2 months she developed multiple skin nodules. Nodule biopsies led to the diagnosis of relapsed disseminated M. abscessus infection. The patient had previously documented ototoxicity secondary to amikacin and was therefore started on treatment with azithromycin, tigecycline, and imipenem. In addition, the patient was found to have new lung nodules on a thoracic computed tomography scan. After 3 months of therapy (June 2013), she developed hepatotoxicity with severe transaminitis and diarrhea. An extensive hepatology evaluation attributed the hepatotoxicity to azithromycin. Because of the patient's history of ototoxicity and renal injury due to amikacin and the possible hepatotoxicity from azithromycin, clofazimine treatment was initiated. In vitro susceptibility testing of the M. abscessus demonstrated susceptibility to tigecycline and clofazimine with resistance to augmentin, bactrim, and linezolid. After obtaining compassionate use and Investigational New Drug (IND) approval through the Florida Department of Health, the patient's regimen was changed to high-dose clofazimine (200 mg by mouth daily) and tigecycline (50 mg IV twice daily). High-dose clofazimine was chosen based on history of disseminated and recurrent mycobacterial infection in a highly immunocompromised patient. Four months later (October 2013), the patient's skin lesions had resolved and repeat chest imaging revealed resolution of the previously noted lung nodules (Figure ).
One month after initiating clofazimine, the patient developed severe diarrhea with up to 20 watery bowel movements a day. Her diarrhea persisted despite discontinuation of her azithromycin. The evaluation for weight loss demonstrated severe malabsorption including anemia (hemoglobin of 10 g per dL), with macrocytosis (mean corpuscular volume 109.1 fl, red cell distribution width 19.3% [reference range, 11.5%–15.0%]), decreased levels of prealbumin of 8 mg per dL (reference range, 20–40 mg per dL), and decreased albumin (2.1 g per dL [reference range, 3.2–5 .0 g per dL]). Laboratory evaluation also revealed a fat-soluble vitamin deficiency as well as other vitamin deficiencies including folate, vitamin D, 25-OH, and total serum carotene.
After 7 months on high-dose clofazimine, she presented with hematochezia, failure to thrive with a 17-pound weight loss (127 lb to 110 lb), persistent diarrhea, and right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed tenderness of the right lower quadrant on deep palpation, 2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities bilaterally, and maroon stools on rectal exam. She had no evidence of recurrent mycobacterium infection nor of relapsing lymphoma.
Endoscopic evaluation revealed black pigmentation of the duodenum. Colonoscopy demonstrated severely congested mucosa with petechiae in the terminal ileum (Figure 2A). Small bowel and terminal ileum biopsies revealed intestinal mucosa with focal villous blunting and widening due to numerous crystal-laden macrophages infiltrating the superficial lamina propria, consistent with crystal-storing histiocytosis, which is indicative of clofazimine enteropathy (Figure 2B). Clofazimine and all M. abscessus treatment was subsequently discontinued, and the patient had no further gastrointestinal bleeding. She experienced complete resolution of her diarrhea 3 months later, with a 15-pound weight gain noted within 4 months of the discontinuation of the clofazimine. She was initially treated with parenteral nutrition but is now maintained on an oral diet with no recurrence of her gastrointestinal symptoms or of her mycobacterial infection 2 years after the diagnosis of clofazimine enteropathy. This adverse drug effect was reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 47-years-old woman with diabetes mellitus presented to our department with severe abdominal pain and fever. The local hospital’s computed tomography showed massive mural thrombosis in the thoracic and abdominal aorta from the level of the diaphragmatic muscle to the superior mesenteric artery (Fig. ). The spleen had a large area of infarction complicated by portal venous thrombosis. This patient underwent amputation three years ago due to extensive thrombosis of the left upper extremity artery. Further examination in our hospital showed thrombosis in the portal vein, the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein. Laboratory examination showed the following: prothrombin time 10.9 s, D-Dimer 1.030 μg/mL, C-reactive protein > 200 mg/mL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 99 mm/h, NH3 73.5 μmol/L. Rheumatic immune tests, liver function, kidney function and electrolytes were normal, except for an albumin of 25.6 g/L.
Preoperative preparation and intraoperative procedures were carefully performed to improve the success rate and to reduce the risk of thrombus shedding during intervention. The catheter and guide wire was placed in the mesenteric artery and left renal artery via left femoral artery puncture, so that balloon angioplasty or stent implantation could be performed immediately once those branch vessels were blocked by shedding thrombus. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the use of RFS and the right femoral artery was incised to implant the RSF. The aortic thrombus was successfully compressed and fixed without thrombosis during intervention (Fig. a, b). A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPSS) procedure was conducted and a thrombolytic catheter was inserted in the portal vein for thrombolysis (Fig. a, b). Urokinase 100,000 units (Lizhu pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Guangdong, China) was dissolved in 50 ml of normal saline, and given by microinfusion pump every 8 h. Warfarin sodium tablets 3.75 mg (Qilu pharmaceutical, Shangdong, China) were taken orally once a day after the procedure. In addition, 1000 units of heparin sodium (Fengyuan pharmaceutical co., Ltd., Anhui, China) and 0.6 mg of octreotide (Chinese medicine & pharmaceutical co., Ltd., China) were dissolved in 50 ml of normal saline and given by microinfusion pump every 12 h. Omeprazole 40 mg (Changchun Fuchun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Changchun, China) and levofloxacin 0.6 mg (Yangzijiang Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., Jiangshu, China) were administrated intravenously once a day.
Relief of the patient’s abdominal pain was evident 3 days after the interventional procedure, and pain resolved completely after 15 days. Angiography showed that the abdominal aortic thrombus was mostly dissolved, with only a few residual thrombi. A 12 F sheath was introduced through the guide wire and the RSF was retrieved (Fig. c, d). Catheter angiography confirmed an recovery of portal vein thrombosis via indwelling catheter. Portal vein thrombosis almost completely disappeared and the patient was discharged after 16 days (Fig. c). She received oral warfarin sodium 100 mg per day for anticoagulation with an international normalized ratio of 2–3. One month later, the bilateral renal artery, superior mesenteric artery, lower extremity artery and portal vein were well visualized, without thrombosis. The upper abdominal aorta was normal with a small amount of residual thrombus. The patient appears normal and no complications have occurred after 14 months.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"Black female patient; nine years and three months old. She had progressive weight
gain and a decrease in growth velocity, which had been observed since the age of
5 years old. Height1.14 m, Z score -3.24 (below the percentile <2.5); weight
37 kg, Z score 1.33 (>P97); Body Mass Index (BMI) 28.6 kg/m2, Z
score 3.2 (>P97); acanthosis nigricans, hypertrichosis, hunch back, globular
abdomen without purplish stretch marks. Developmental stage in puberty according
to the Tanner Scale M3 P5. Bone age of six years and ten months old, with a
chronological age of nine years and three months old. No history of
glucocorticoid use.
Laboratory tests () showed that she
had ­ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism and no apparent pituitary adenoma in three
1.5 MRI studies. Additionally, the patient participated in a dynamic study when
she was 9, 10 and 12 years old. Bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling
(BIPSS) was indicated. The exam was performed three years after the first
consultation, and the result was unclear due to technical problems. At 12 years
of age, the patient was submitted to a 3-RM MRI in the dynamic study. In the
post-contrast (gadolinium) sequence, the sagittal section, and the T1 sequence,
a contrasting hypocaptive image was found. It was located in the adenohypophysis
on the left side’s cavernous sinus. It measured 2.9 × 2.6 × 2.5 mm, which is
compatible with microadenoma ().
Details of this technique can be found in . A transsphenoidal surgery was performed on the patient when she
was 12 years and 11 months old and because she had enough adrenal to be
diagnosed with hypercortisolim, she took prednisone for two years. Even after
she was cured of hipercortisolism, she did not grow enough. Recombinant growth
hormones were then prescribed, even though the growth hormone test was
responsive after glucagon stimulation (). She thus became officially defined as having idiopathic short
stature. The patient’s final height was 1.41 m, which did not reach the family
target of 1.61 m.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 35-year-old mentally disabled woman with a psychiatric history of obsessive behavior in childhood and anxiety disorder consulted the dermatology department for generalized pruritus. She was diagnosed with atopic dermatitis which resolved after corticoid-based therapy. In 2005, she was referred to our department because of laterocervical lymphadenopathies and night fever with intense sweating. Body computed tomography (CT) showed supra- and infra-diaphragmatic lymphadenopathies with various abdominal masses, the most relevant being 8×6×8 cm3. A biopsy of a lymphadenopathy revealed NS classic HL. With a final diagnosis of NS HL stage IIIB with an International Prognostic Score 2, she received six cycles of ABVD chemotherapy regimen with partial response and an early relapse in March 2006 (primary refractory to ABVD). This was followed by a salvage chemotherapy regimen (two cycles of ESHAP) with no response. In September 2006, a third chemotherapy regimen (four cycles of GemOx) was initiated with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia grade 4, which led to dose-intensity failures followed by chemotherapy discontinuation and radiotherapy consolidation. One month after the last radiotherapy session, the HL progressed; so, two cycles of IFE regimen were given with stable disease. Considering the basal comorbidities of the patient, we decided to pursue a watch-and-wait policy from 2008 to 2010, treating localized areas of progression with radiotherapy and obtaining transient partial responses (). In October 2010, a new mass appeared in D8–D9, presenting with a medullar compression syndrome. After a biopsy that confirmed HL relapse, it was treated with radiotherapy and six cycles of GemOx, which led to a partial response. However, a new progression occurred in the left cervical and axillary nodes within 1 month, which was observed with a watch-and-wait policy with the consent of the family.
In May 2012, our patient presented a new clinically symptomatic disease progression confirmed by positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, requiring bendamustine 90 mg/m2 and finally reaching disease stability. In August 2014, the HL progressed again with significant B symptoms and worsening clinical status (). At this point, based on our experience of the potential role of COX-2 expression in HL, and that the patient was not a candidate for intensive chemotherapy and brentuximab was still not available in our center, we decided to start an experimental treatment with celecoxib 200 mg every 12 hours and lenalidomide 20 mg (for 3 of every 4 weeks). This regimen was obtained through a compassionate use request. Our patient received this treatment from August 2014 to January 2015 (six cycles) with unremarkable toxicity and excellent tolerance, finally showing a CR for the first time in both the interim after three cycles and the final CT/PET after six cycles (). This response was maintained in a new CT scan in August 2015. After this induction, we started 1 year of celecoxib maintenance (200 mg/12 hours) that had to be stopped because of anemia due to gastrointestinal bleeding in March 2016.
In July 2016, with the most durable response until that moment being 22 months, our patient presented a new disease relapse. CT/PET showed supra- and infra-abdominal adenopathies with associated hepatic and splenic lesions. As two different biopsies of hypermetabolic locations resulted negative and keeping in mind the asymptomatic situation of our patient, we decided to restart celecoxib 200 mg every 12 hours. In this context, the disease progressed to ascites requiring paracentesis. Biopsies were constantly negative until February 2017, when a final biopsy confirmed the persistence of HL. At that point, we decided to start brentuximab vedotin (two cycles). During the second cycle of brentuximab, the patient required intensive care admission due to a sepsis with a fatal outcome.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 45-year-old South Asian woman presented with a progressively worsening of proximal muscle weakness. Initially there was a mild pain in her thighs and arms which was followed by a difficulty getting up from the seated position and inability of raising her arms. There was no dysphagia, regurgitation or difficulty in breathing. During this particular presentation there was no dermatological manifestations suggestive of dermatomyositis or mechanic’s hands. There was no history suggestive of Raynaud’s phenomenon or any joint pains. There was a mild nonproductive cough which developed a few weeks after the onset of the muscle symptoms without any notable shortness of breath of exertion or wheezing. There was no other evidence of any connective tissue diseases.
There was no ptosis, double vision or fatiguability to suggestive myasthenia. Patient appeared to be clinically euthyroid without any overt features of hypothyroidism. There was no history of statin use at the time of the presentation or prior to that. Patient denied any similar history previously nor was there a history of a similar disease among her family members.
Examination revealed bilateral symmetrical proximal muscle weakness with a muscle power of 4/5 in all four limbs. Reflexes were intact without any muscle wasting. There were no overt features of dermatomyositis. Auscultation of the lungs revealed a few bilateral basal fine end inspiratory crepitations suggestive an interstitial lung disease. Second heart sound was of normal intensity. A diagnosis of inflammatory myositis was considered with a concurrent interstitial lung disease. With this clinical text she was thoroughly investigated.
Creatinine phosphokinase levels were elevated with a value of 1435 u/l. Inflammatory markers were elevated with a ESR of 54 though the CRP was only slightly elevated. ANA was negative. Findings on electromyography was consistent with an inflammatory myositis. Muscle biopsy which was carried out revealed inflammatory cells in between the muscle fibers causing complete necrosis of some of the muscle fibers. Anti Jo-1 antibody was positive. HRCT revealed bilateral homogenous sub pleural basal ground glass opacification suggestive of non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (Fig. ). She was started on oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day with azathioprine 50 mg per day which was later increased to 100 mg per day. Subsequently her muscle power improved, CPK levels normalized and the cough which was present improved.
She attended her follow up clinic visits and was compliant with her medication. She was in remission for 2 years with low dose prednisolone and azathioprine. She was asymptomatic with no muscle pains, proximal muscle weakness and CPK levels were within normal range. She continued to be free from any cough or shortness of breath. ESR was persistently normal with values in the mid 20’s.
Following a period of unsatisfactory compliance of 4 weeks, she presented with fissuring and cracking of the fingers suggestive of mechanic’s hands (Fig. ) without any muscle pain or weakness. She denied any recurrence of the cough which she had during the initial disease presentation and did not have any shortness of breath. Her CPK was within normal limits at that time. Though there was no evidence of a systemic relapse, the steroid dose was up titrated while continuing azathioprine. However, the mechanic’s hands did not improve and subsequently in the following month she started to complain of a pain in her thighs and arms with a subtle weakness. Her CPK had risen to 1427 u/L and ESR risen to 47. Given the overall clinical picture it was decided that she required escalation of her immunosuppressive therapy. She was started on IV cyclophosphamide 500 mg every 2 weekly and after 3 doses the skin manifestations started to resolve and CPK had normalized (Fig. ). Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily was added as patient had prominent dermatological manifestations with photosensitivity (Table ).
Repeat HRCT revealed stable nonspecific interstitial pneumoniae without any radiological progression. Lung function tests revealed a restrictive lung disease with a FVC of 78% of predicted, FEV1 of 94% of predicted with FEV1/FVC of 124%. DLCO was 49%.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 60-year-old male experienced dimmed vision in his left eye for 3 days prior to his first visit. The patient negated any other symptoms, including pain and diplopia. He had a history of two previous occurrences of possible ON – 30 years ago in his left eye and some 10 years later in his right eye. The patient had a history of hypertension and was currently on antihypertensive drugs. No relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) was present at his first examination. BCVA was 0.65 in the right eye and 0.5 in his left eye. A fundus examination revealed an atrophic and excavated disc in his right eye. An optic disc edema was present in his left eye. Retina was normal in both eyes. Laboratory tests for sarcoidosis, syphilis, and giant cell arteritis were analyzed, including determination of HGB, blood count, serum calcium, ESR, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), and Wassermann reaction (WR). All tests were normal or negative. Visual field and color vision were analyzed 3 days later; visual field test showed arcuate inferior defects in both eyes, with equivalent neural capacity of 67% in his right eye and 58% in his left eye. A Sahlgren’s saturation test (SST) color vision test revealed a more defective color vision in his left (20) than in his right (15) eye.
An orbital MRI carried out 1 week later revealed increased signal intensity in the parts of the left optical nerve sheath, possibly indicating OPN. The MRI also showed increased signaling in the retrobulbar fat of the left eye. No increased swelling of the extraocular muscles was evident.
The patient received a course of prednisone, 60 mg/day, which was tapered over 1 month, at which time he was examined again. BCVA was 1.0 in the right eye and 0.65 in his left eye. The optic disc edema had subsided substantially since the last fundus examination 1 month earlier. He received a new course of prednisone, starting with 25 mg/day, which was tapered to 7.5 mg/day until his next visit 2 months later. His BCVA was 1.0 in his right eye and 0.65 in his left eye.
Visual field testing again showed arcuate inferior defects in both eyes and abnormal thresholds, with equivalent neural capacity of 69% in his right eye and 61% in his left eye. A new MRI showed a slight regression of the enhancement around the left optical nerve since the last MRI. The results of a fundus examination revealed a pale papilla in both eyes. He remained on 7.5 mg/day prednisone, which was tapered over 14 weeks.

"The patient was a 58-year-old woman suffering from lower abdominal pain and vomiting, which gradually worsened from the start of December 2017. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed multiple gastric ulcers and scars, and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed inflammation in the large intestine. The patient had undergone surgery in 1997 for cervical carcinoma, followed by postoperative radiotherapy that involved irradiation of her pelvis and stomach. On the basis of the symptoms, endoscopy findings, and medical history, the patient was diagnosed with refractory multiple gastric ulcers, enterocolitis, and paralytic ileus due to late radiation-induced sequelae.
As a result of frequent vomiting, the patient had become unable to ingest orally. She was hospitalized in October 2018 and fasted before being placed under central venous nutrition control. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was started to treat the intractable multiple gastric ulcers and ileus. Thirty treatment sessions were scheduled over a period of approximately 1–2 months. Pentazocine and tramadol were administered to treat the abdominal pain, but these achieved poor results.
At hospitalization, the patient was 155 cm tall and weighed 43 kg. Although she exhibited abdominal distention, no muscular defense or rebound pain was observed. On percussion, the bowel sound was attenuated. A blood examination revealed anemia, slight liver dysfunction, low protein levels, and hypoalbuminemia. An abdominal X-ray showed several small intestinal niveau and extension of the colon and small intestine by intestinal gas (Fig. a).
The patient experienced increased lower abdominal pain during bowel movements and felt relieved after defecation. Consequently, we hypothesized that her abdominal pain was due to poor peristalsis of the intestinal tract and that blocking the sympathetic nerve of the intestinal tract would help normalize the peristaltic movement and relieve the pain. The pain was strongest in the lower abdomen at the level of the 12th thoracic nerve. An epidural catheter was inserted via the lumbar1–2 intervertebral space, and continuous epidural anesthesia with 0.2% ropivacaine at 4 ml/h was administered for 1 week, resulting in good control of the lower abdominal pain and defecation. This allowed the tramadol, which promotes constipation, to be discontinued. A block of the inferior mesenteric artery plexus with ethanol was performed, resulting in an immediate improvement in the patient’s bowel movements and defecation, and a reduction in lower abdominal pain, now measured as 3 on a numerical rating scale (NRS = 3). An abdominal X-ray was performed after the block procedure, showing the number of intestinal niveau and the amount of gas had decreased, as compared to that before the block (Fig. b). The control of lower abdominal pain was effective, and defecation was noted. Tube feeding was started 4 days after the inferior mesenteric artery plexus block, and oral feeding was started 2 days later.
Twelve days after the block, the patient’s lower abdominal pain increased to NRS 8 and there was recrudescence of the vomiting. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed dilation of the small intestine, as well as the formation of niveau; however, no bowel obstruction or disruption of blood flow was observed (Fig. a).
An upper gastrointestinal contrast examination with contrast medium (Gastrografin®, Bayer Yakuhin Ltd., Osaka, Japan) showed relatively good peristaltic movement of the large and small intestine but poor gastric peristaltic movement. A large amount of food residue was also observed. An epidural catheter was inserted via the thoracic 6–7 intervertebral space for innervation of the upper gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach and small intestine, and continuous epidural anesthesia with 0.2% ropivacaine at 4 ml/h was started. This alleviated the abdominal pain, and the vomiting disappeared.
Approximately 2 weeks later, continuous epidural anesthesia was stopped, and a splanchnic nerve block with ethanol was performed (Fig. c). This resulted in an improvement in the lower abdominal pain to NRS 1, as well as an increase in food intake. The following day, CT showed a large improvement in the ileus (Fig. b). An upper gastrointestinal contrast examination showed that peristaltic movement of the upper gastrointestinal tract had improved (Fig. ). The subsequent course was good, and the hyperbaric oxygen therapy was completed. The patient was discharged from hospital at the end of January. At the outpatient visit 2 weeks later, the general condition of the patient was good and she could orally intake her normal diet.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A variant SN was found during the routine dissection of a male Caucasian cadaver aged 72-years-old at death. The right SN was split by the PM into two roots, a superior CFN part and an inferior TN part (). The superior root was found to pierce the piriformis and the inferior root traveled inferior to the inferior border of the piriformis (infrapiriformis foramen). Distal (approximately 3 cm) to the piriformis, the CFN and TN were united by a communicating branch (Cb) descending superomedial to inferolateral in an oblique manner. The Cb was approximately 1 cm in width by 3 cm in length. Distal to this Cb, the CFN and TN continued toward the popliteal fossa and were distributed in normal fashion to the anterior/lateral and posterior compartments of the leg, respectively. No atrophy or other pathology was noted in any muscles of the leg and no other anatomical variations of the left or right lower limbs (including gluteal region) were noted.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 60-year-old woman admitted for elective excision of a right thyroid papillary carcinoma. She had complained of hoarseness and aspiration while swallowing for several months. Rigid endoscopy confirmed paramedian vocal cord fixation with large glottic chink. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) detected a solid thyroid mass invading the perithyroid tissue with suspicion of right tracheoesophageal groove invasion. Total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection was carried out via transcervical incision. Intraoperatively, the tumor was found to invade the right recurrent laryngeal nerve and along the right tracheoesophageal groove (). The right recurrent laryngeal nerve was sacrificed and the tumor invading the tracheoesophageal groove was shaved off the trachea and esophagus. After tracheal shaving, a small perforation (0.5×0.5 cm) was noticed in the posterior membranous portion of first tracheal ring (). The pleura of the lung and mediastinum were intact. The perforation was repaired primarily with No. 4-0 Vicryl suture and reinforced with Surgicel® and tissue glue. The trachea did not leak by underwater testing during positive anesthetic ventilation and the operation was completed.
One day after surgery, the patient developed dyspnea, cervical emphysema, and ecchymosis over the neck after an episode of vigorous coughing. With the impression of a postoperative hematoma an emergency neck exploration was performed under general anesthesia. A small hematoma was found beneath the platysma and strap muscles, No obvious bleeding point was evident and the reconstructed trachea portion was relatively intact. Postoperatively, while still in the recovery room, the patient showed signs of acute respiratory failure. A chest radiograph revealed bilateral pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and massive subcutaneous emphysema (). Her dyspnea and cyanosis were relieved after an emergency chest tube was inserted. Over the next week, the pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax resolved gradually. The patient discharged without any problems.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 47-year-old Chinese man presented to our department of ophthalmology with a 26-month history of left upper eyelid painless swelling and redness. The patient was initially treated with a course of intravenous penicillin, which resulted in temporary regression of the lesion. There had been no similar family history of this appearance to date.
Physical examination revealed that the left lacrimal gland was obviously swelling, which presented with a soft, non-tender and smooth-surfaced. Slit lamp examination was otherwise unremarkable aside from bilateral mild cataract. Laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 9.8 × 10-9/L with 15.91% eosinophils(normal range: 0.05-0.5 × 10-9/L). Serum concentration of immunoglobulin E was elevated at 469.3 IU/ml, and immunoglobulin G4 was 295 mg/dL (normal range less than 135 mg/dL). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination of the orbit showed that the left lacrimal gland was lobulated with a distinct margin and was predominantly isointense on T1-weighted images. Isointense on T2-weighted images and an obvious heterogeneous enhancement on contrast-enhanced MRI images are shown in Figure . The chest radiograph was normal and no cervical lymph nodes were palpable.Next, we advised the patient to be hospitalized and the patient underwent an orbital biopsy. Intraoperative frozen sections were reported as being consistent with a benign tumor. Therefore, a complete resection was undertaken. Perioperatively, it was noted that the mass had a smooth and homogeneous grey appearance. There was no evidence of haemorrhage or cystic change and borders were indistinct. A definite diagnosis of KD was made by histopathology and immunohistochemical examinations of representative resected specimens after surgery. Histopathological examination demonstrated follicular hyperplasia with evidence of reactive germinal centres. Eosinophilic infiltration, involving the interfollicular areas, and proliferation of post capillary venules were observed. These features enabled a diagnosis of KD to be made (Figure A). Further analysis, including immuohistochemistry, was undertaken, demonstrating positive staining for CK, Vimentin, CD3, CD4, CD20, CD21, CD117, CD5, CD8, CD23, IgG and IgG4 (30 per high-power field) and negative staining for CD10 and CD34 (Figure B), the ratio of IgG4 to IgG positive cells was about 35%. The pathological diagnosis, which was also the final diagnosis, was KD. However, some ophthalmologists questioned whether the histological and immunohistochemical findings were also had common features with IgG4-related disease, which is a newly recognized fibro-inflammatory condition characterized by tumefactive lesions, a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate rich in IgG4-positive plasma cells, storiform fibrosis, and elevated serum IgG4 concentrations.
The patient was discharged following his surgery and treated with prednisone 25 mg/day for four weeks and then reduce by 5 mg/day every two weeks. His symptoms gradually improved. Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels dropped to 125.9 IU/mL and eosinophil’s decreased to 0.69 × 109/L after 2 months. There was no sign of recurrence in twelve months of regular follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 64-year-old man was admitted to an outside hospital 6 months prior with a brain abscess and underwent surgery. He experienced recurrent epistaxis and was on anticoagulation therapy for chronic atrial fibrillation. During follow-up, he developed dyspnea, and chest CT showed a left-sided pleural effusion (Fig. a). Chest drainage revealed the collection to be a hemothorax, and the patient was referred to our hospital. Laboratory data showed slight anemia with a hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dl. Pulmonary function tests were within normal range. Chest CT after drainage revealed a solitary 15-mm nodule in the periphery of the left lower lobe, and identification of a feeding artery and draining vein on three-dimensional CT (3DCT) suggested that the node was a PAVM (Fig. b, c). The PAVM was adjacent to the diaphragm, and multi-detector CT (MDCT) and 3DCT demonstrated that the peripheral nodule slightly displaced the diaphragm, with the nodule protruding into the pleural cavity (Fig. ). After multidisciplinary conference, we believed that surgical therapy might be preferable to catheter embolization for the following reasons. Firstly, the patient had already developed a brain abscess and hemothorax, so definitive treatment without a chance for recurrence was paramount. The second reason was that the PAVM was a solitary, small nodule located in the periphery of the lung, with MDCT and 3DCT indicating that the nodule might be in close proximity to the visceral pleura protruding into the pleural cavity, making minimally invasive wedge resection straightforward.
The patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position, and VATS with three ports was performed. The maximum incision length was 15 mm. The PAVM protruded from the periphery of the lung like a polyp, and wedge resection was easily performed after simple adhesiolysis (Fig. ). There were no complications, and the patient remained asymptomatic after 1-year of follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"An 80-year-old Japanese man hospitalized due to acute exacerbation stemming from asthma and COPD overlap presented with left-side pneumothorax caused by respiratory tract infection. Subsequently, a chest drain tube was inserted; however, a tumor suspicious for lung cancer was present at the entrance of the left upper lobe bronchus. The lung could not be sufficiently expanded, and an air leak was present. We performed pleurodesis twice (first: 200 mL of autologous blood and 4 g of talc; second: 200 mL of autologous blood), but the air leak persisted. Since surgical treatments were considered high risk for this patient due to poor lung function, we decided to treat by bronchial occlusion with EWS. Under bronchoscopy, a tumor was observed with a smooth surface at the entrance of the upper left lobe (Fig. ). A balloon occlusion test was performed using a balloon catheter (Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA) with a diameter of 4 Fr and an inflated balloon diameter of 9 mm, to determine the affected bronchi. After the entire left lower lobe bronchus was occluded by the balloon, the air leak ceased. Subsequently, bronchography was performed to identify the affected bronchi at the subsegmental bronchial level. The catheter was inserted into the subsegmental bronchus, and a contrast medium (iopamidol 5 mL and saline 15 mL) was injected from the tip. The contrast medium was injected from the left B8a and left B8b bronchi (Fig. ). Fluoroscopy confirmed contrast leakage from the left B8b bronchus into the thoracic cavity, and we suspected major leakage at the bronchi leading from the left B8b and the left B6 bronchi (Fig. ). We then successfully inserted a medium-sized EWS into the left B8b bronchus. Subsequently, we attempted to insert a large-sized EWS into the left B6 bronchus, but the fitting was difficult. Thus, we cut the end of the EWS to size and inserted it into the left B6a bronchus. After EWS insertions, the air leak clearly decreased. Finally, occluding the left B6 and left B8 bronchi by balloon catheter, we confirmed a slight but further decrease in air leakage. Therefore, we judged the remaining air leak to be minor. After bronchial occlusion, we performed pleurodesis twice (first: Picibanil (OK-432) 5 KE; Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan, minocycline 300 mg; second: 50% glucose solution and 120 mL of autologous blood), and the air leak ceased completely. The chest drain tube was successfully removed. Several days later, he was diagnosed with pyothorax. The empyema cavity was confined to a small area, and it was difficult to puncture. Therefore, we treated with antibiotics (tazobactam-piperacillin 4.5 g 4 times a day). After 4 weeks of antibiotics therapy, he was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 46-year-old male with a history of drug, alcohol and tobacco abuse was admitted to the emergency department with altered level of consciousness. At admission, no close companion was present to provide a detailed medical history. A complete clinical examination and various laboratory tests were performed, and uremia was diagnosed. The lab tests showed a serum creatinine level of 17.2 mg/dL (reference range [RR] = 0.7-1.2 mg/dL); serum urea 318 mg/dL (RR = 10-50 mg/dL); hemoglobin 4.8 g/dL (RR: 13-18g/dL) with intense poikilocytosis; peripheral white blood cell count 5,220 cells/mm3 (RR = 4,000-11,000 cells/mm3); total peripheral lymphocyte count 400 cells/mm3 (RR = 900-3,400 cells/mm3); arterial pH 7.208 (RR: 7.37-7.44) and serum bicarbonate 6.1 mmol/L (RR: 23-29 mmol/L). A head computed tomography (CT) and a lumbar puncture were also carried out, both of which showed normal results. Dialytic treatment and adjuvant measures were then initiated, and the patient’s mental and general condition improved progressively over the next few days. The serology panel requested at admission showed two ELISA positives for HIV antibodies, non-immunization for HBV, a positive Toxoplasma immunoglobulin (Ig)G (by electrochemiluminescence, with 650.0 IU/mL [RR ≥ 3 IU/mL]) and a positive HVA IgG. Other serologic tests, including anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) and anti-T. cruzi antibodies were negative. The HIV infection was then confirmed by Western blotting. However, the patient was not aware of his HIV status. The TCD4+ peripheral count was 74 cells/µL, TCD8+ peripheral count was, 171 cells/ µL (TCD4+/TCD8+ ratio = 0.43) and the HIV-1 RNA viral load in the blood was 66,309 copies/mL (branched DNA) or 4.82 Log. The blood cultures were negative.
On the 28th day of hospitalization, the patient manifested acute hepatitis, with significant elevation of serum canalicular enzymes (direct bilirrubin (DB) = 2.63 mg/dL [RR < 0.3 mg/dL], alkaline phosphatase (AP) = 1,248 U/L [RR: 40-129 U/L]) and liver enzymes (AST = 172 U/L [RR < 37 U/L], ALT = 447 U/L [RR < 41 U/L]) attributed to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) prescribed to prevent opportunistic infections. The detection of HCV RNA by the real-time polymerase chain reaction assay was negative in the blood. These antibiotics were discontinued for 2 weeks, when the canalicular enzyme levels returned to the reference range. Combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) was not prescribed during hospitalization due to the patient’s liver dysfunction. On the 55th day of hospitalization, the patient developed refractory shock attributed to nosocomial pneumonia as he presented cough, fever, and thoracic rales (see chest x-ray and chest CT in ). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was not performed due to the poor clinical condition of the patient.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics and vasoactive drugs were prescribed associated with dialysis and mechanical ventilation, but the patient did not respond favorably and died. The blood cultures were negative, and the microscopic analysis and culture of the sputum were negative. The autopsy was requested and was performed with the agreement of the patient’s relatives.
The corpse weighed 65 kg and measured 177 cm (body mass index 20.74). The external examination was unremarkable. The lungs were heavy (the right lung weighed 1,126 g and the left lung 936.0 g [RR = 400-800 g]), congested, and showed signs of anthracosis. The parenchymal cut surface was violaceous, friable, with diffuse consolidation (lung hepatization), associated with abundant purulent secretions draining from the airways. Microscopic examination revealed significant congestion and pneumonia characterized by scattered foci of necrosis, a variable number of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear inflammatory cells () associated with granular eosinophilic cysts and free arc-shaped structures with eccentric nuclei (measuring 7 µm) compatible with Toxoplasma gondii cysts and tachyzoites, respectively ().
The cysts were periodic acid Schiff (PAS) positive and the immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the T. gondii antigen (Rabbit Polyclonal Antibody, Cell Marque™) was positive in both cysts and tachyzoites ().
The liver weighed 1,570 g (RR: 1,400-1,600 g), was extremely congested, and had a finely granular capsule. The histology demonstrated cirrhosis with dense mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in the portal tracts, focal steatosis, centrilobular congestion, and necrosis of hepatocytes. The spleen weighed 268.0 g (RR; 100.0 -150.0 g), and the red pulp was friable. Microscopic analysis showed that the red pulp exhibited splenitis and hemorrhagic foci, and that the white pulp had an intense lymphocytic depletion. The kidneys were both atrophic, with a granular external surface. Microscopic examination revealed diffuse glomerular hyalinization, some glomeruli with collapse of the glomerular tuft (collapsing glomerulopathy), cystic dilatation of the renal tubules, chronic interstitial nephritis associated with interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy ().
The bone marrow was hypercellular due to increased granulocytic-lineage cells, and numerous plasmacytes and micromegakaryocytes. The brain weighed 1,302 g (RR: 1,200-1,600 g) and was congested and edematous. Microscopy showed sparse areas of necrosis associated with congestion, edema, and discrete interstitial and perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate. The T. gondii antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry in the cytoplasm of inflammatory cells, confirming central nervous system involvement (). The heart weighed 512 g (RR: 200-350 g) and had concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, with no signs of T. gondii infection at the microscopic level. The eyes were not examined, and other organs had no significant histological features. The Grocott’s, Gram, and Ziehl-Neelsen stains were negative in the lungs, brain, heart, and bone marrow. Tissues were not collected for postmortem microbiological analysis.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 44-year-old man without systemic underlying disease suffered from painless gross hematuria combined with urine retention for days. He had LUTS for years and became worse recently. Stony-hard prostate with markedly enlarged size was found during digital rectal examination, but the PSA level was detected within the normal range (total PSA: 0.42 ng/mL). Transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) revealed multiple nodules in the prostate. The largest nodule is 6.3 cm and the whole prostate measures about 300 grams. Architecture derangement of prostate, possible central necrosis with hemorrhage, and enlarged right internal iliac lymphadenopathy were found on prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (). No bony metastasis was detected on the bone scan. We performed TRUS-guided prostate biopsy but massive gross hematuria attacked days after the procedure. Thus, cystoscopy for checking bleeding was done and the specimen resected from prostate was reported as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (). For further staging, we arranged chest computed tomography (CT), which revealed a solitary 0.9 cm nodule in the right upper lobe.
Considering the difficulty of radical surgery due to huge size of prostate, we prescribed neoadjuvant chemotherapy (5-Fluorouracil + Cisplatin + Ifosfamide) for 5 cycles. Regression of previous lung nodule was found on follow-up chest CT. Pelvic MRI revealed residual tumor lesion within the visible prostate gland, whose size regressed to 83 grams. The radical cystoprostatectomy was performed, and tumor invasion to bladder was found during operation. Bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection was also done and no metastasis was found. The pathologic diagnosis reported was consistent with MPNST.
After the operation, we prescribed adjuvant concomitant chemoradiation therapy (Cisplatin + 5-Fluorouracil + Ifosfamide with external beam radiation therapy 6600 cGy, 33 fractions). Follow-up abdominal CT done in postoperative 3 months showed multiple ill-defined poorly enhanced nodules in the liver and a 3.5 cm gallbladder mass. The target therapy, Pazopanib 400 mg per day, was given for palliative treatment due to suspect disease progression. However, his clinical condition went downhill and he expired three months later.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 24-year-old man riding a motorcycle collided with a car while turning to the right. He fell off the motorcycle after the collision, and was injured by another car. He had no previous medical history. When he was brought to our emergency department in an ambulance, his airway was patent, he was tachypneic, hypotensive, tachycardic, and his Glasgow coma scale score was 7 (E1V2M4). Intubation, bilateral chest drainage, and blood transfusion were performed. Following assessment by whole-body computed tomography (CT), he was diagnosed with bilateral pneumothorax, liver and spleen injuries, fractures of the left acetabulum, right patella and tibial plateau, with open fractures of the shaft of the right femur and distal third of the left femur (Fig. ). External fixation and irrigation of both thighs were performed in the operating room. The liver and spleen injuries were treated conservatively. After surgery, his consciousness disorder persisted. Initially, hypoxia was not accompanied by significant changes in chest radiographs; however, serial chest radiographs showed progressive bilateral pulmonary opacities consistent with ARDS (Fig. A and B). Contrast-enhanced CT also showed bilateral patchy gland glass opacity and consolidation matching chest radiographs, and there was no filling defect in pulmonary artery. Arterial blood gases on the 4th day of admission showed a PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio of 100 mmHg under 10 cm H2O of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). In addition, the patient developed subconjunctival, abdominal, and precordial petechiae (Fig. ). He remained tachycardic, febrile with a body temperature >38°C, and was jaundiced. Laboratory data showed exacerbation of anemia (hemoglobin, 9.1 × 10 g/L), decreased platelet count (88 × 109 /L), and elevated total bilirubin levels (8.9 × 10 μmol/ L). Gurd and Wilson criteria (3 major and 5 minor criteria) and Schonfeld scoring system were used for the diagnosis of FES. The criteria of both scoring systems were met, thereby supporting the positive diagnosis of FES (Table ).[
The patient had type 1 respiratory failure which gradually worsened with conventional lung-protective ventilation. Due to a persistent consciousness disorder, prophylactic antiepileptic drug administration, anticerebral edema therapy, and targeted temperature management using an intravascular temperature control catheter were performed.[ On the 6th day of admission, the Murray score was 3.5 indicating severe lung injury: P/F ratio of 81 mmHg (4 points), pulmonary edema in all lung fields on chest X-ray (4 points), PEEP of 14 cm H2O (3 points), compliance of 23.3 ml/cm H2O (3 points). Because his cardiac function was not reduced and hemodynamic status was maintained, we chose VV-ECMO over venoarterial-ECMO.[ A 23 French multi-stage drainage cannula was inserted from the left femoral vein to the inferior vena cava, and a 17 French single-stage return cannula was cannulated from the right internal jugular vein to the superior vena cava. The ECMO rotation speed was 3300 r/minute and the flow rate was 4.5 L/minute with 100%FiO2 and 4.5 L/minute sweep gas flow. Under the condition, his peripheral oxygen saturation was maintained >95% and blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.42, PO2 of 95 mmHg, and PCO2 of 46.6 mmHg. Although lung protection management was continued with high PEEP and low tidal volume after VV-ECMO introduction, improvement in respiratory condition was not observed. Therefore, we decided to convert the external fixation to internal fixation to begin prone position therapy. Osteosynthesis was performed on the 9th day of admission under VV-ECMO. In the supine position a tourniquet was applied on the left side. The lateral parapatellar approach was used to reduce the fracture and fix the screws and lateral locking plate (Fig. A). The tourniquet was released to place the screws in the proximal holes of the plate, following which there was continued congestive bleeding. Heparin had been introduced into the circuit at the beginning of the operation, but due to a large amount of blood loss, protamine sulfate, an antagonist for heparin, was administered midoperation. The bleeding was controlled by closing the left knee wound and inserting a drain. Osteosynthesis of the right femur was then performed using a retrograde intramedullary nail (Fig. B) without any serious complications. The total operation time was 4 hours and 29 minutes and the total blood loss amounted to 3800 g. Sixteen units of red blood cell transfusion, 20 units of platelet transfusion, and 16 units of fresh frozen plasma were needed. The ECMO circuit was run heparin free for 2 days postsurgery.
Prone-position ventilation was initiated on the second day postsurgery after the hemodynamics became stable. The patient was placed in the prone position for 16 hours a day. Low tidal volume ventilation (6 ml/kg) and an infusion of neuromuscular blockade was introduced. To address severe acute kidney injury due to hemolysis, we also started continuous renal replacement therapy on the 14th day. For 4 days, the patient was managed in the prone position. His respiratory condition and chest radiographs improved steadily over the 8 days following osteosynthesis, and VV-ECMO was discontinued on the 17th day (Fig. C). The ventilator was removed on the 28th day. At that time, his respiratory status improved to P/F ratio: 370, and multiple petechiae disappeared. His conscious level normalized without residual central nervous system complications.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"We examined a 33-year-old male with progressive painless decrease in vision and nystagmus since childhood and no history of night blindness. His best corrected visual acuity was 20/80 with 0.00 diopter sphere (D Sph) / -4.00 diopter cylinder (D Cyl) X 10° in the right eye and 20/60 with 0.00 D Sph / -3.50 D Cyl X 170° in the left eye respectively. Color vision was normal on examination with Ishihara plates. A positive history of similar abnormality was obtained in his sibling (elder brother had similar abnormality). There was no history of consanguinity. Slit-lamp examination was normal and iris did not show any transillumination defect. Intraocular pressure using applanation tonometry was 15 mm of Hg in both eyes. Fundus examination showed macular vascularization, macular hypoplasia and hypoplasic optic nerve head with diffuse retinal pigment epithelial atrophy and prominent choroidal vessels in both eyes. Patient was clinically diagnosed to have foveal hypoplasia. A genetic analysis revealed an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern.
SD-OCT (Copernicus, Italy) was done in both eyes using asterisk scan protocol (7 mm length scan, 6 B-scans with 2743 A-scans per B-scan). SD-OCT was recorded with the eyes in the null zone, to overcome nystagmus. The scan location was assured by positioning the asterisk scan acquisition pattern over the foveal area and this location was assured as the scan passes through the fovea in the fundus image obtained in SD-OCT. The scan revealed absence of foveal dip, preservation of the inner retinal layers with thickened fovea, 270 microns in the right eye and 245 microns in the left eye. The qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the retina were similar in macular and peripheral areas (2° and 7° respectively). The small elevation of the inner segment/ outer segment (IS/OS) junction was absent in the fovea which is otherwise present in normal eyes.
Microperimetry (MP1, Nidek Technologies, Padova, Italy) using 33 stimuli in the central 20° of the macula and 4-2 threshold strategy revealed reduction of retinal sensitivity in the central retina. Mean retinal sensitivity was 7.2 dB in the right eye and 14.2 dB in the left eye. Relative scotoma was present in both eyes at the foveal area. Fixation was relatively unstable in both eyes, with abnormal fixation location (central fixation in the right eye and eccentric fixation in the left eye).

"A 25-year-old Nigerian man presented to our emergency department with complaints of tiredness, night sweats, and dizziness on exertion. On clinical examination the patient had facial swelling and venous distension in the neck. Blood pressure was 135/77 mmHg with pulsus paradoxus. Cardiac auscultation was normal. The liver was enlarged. There was no peripheral oedema. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia of 110 beats/min, a vertical axis, QS pattern in V1 and a Q wave in V2 and low voltages in the limb leads. Laboratory testing showed lymphocytosis, increased creatinine (120 mmol/l) and abnormal liver enzymes (total bilirubin 47 μmol/l, aspartate aminotransferase 124 U/l, alanine aminotransferase 200 U/l and γ-glutamyl transferase 268 U/l).

With abdominal ultrasound the liver diameter was 17.5 cm, with ascites, pleural and pericardial effusion and hepatopetal flow in the portal vein. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a mass almost completely occupying the right atrium and ventricle with a distended inferior vena cava (Fig. ). The pressure gradient over the tricuspid valve was 25 mmHg (PAP 25 + 15 mmHg). Pericardial effusion was present. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax with contrast injected into the right antecubital vein revealed a mass in the anterior mediastinum with no clear distinction from the surrounding structures. There was a lack of contrast in the innominate and superior caval veins, and contrast filled the right atrium through the inferior caval vein by way of collateral veins. A large right atrial filling defect was found with faint filling of the right ventricle (Fig. ).
Due to the important haemodynamic compromise, the induction of anaesthesia was possible only after initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass with cannulation of femoral vessels under local anaesthesia. A large mass was removed from the right atrium (7 × 5 × 5 cm), but tumour tissue extending into the superior vena cava was only partially removed. Histology was compatible with type B2 thymoma. Moreover, within the tumour, immature T cells were found, with positive CD4, CD8, CD5, TdT and cytoplasmatic CD3 immunostaining. After an uneventful recovery, the patient was referred for palliative chemotherapy with cisplatinum, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide. Six months later, after four cycles of chemotherapy, regression of the residual tumour was seen and additive radiotherapy was planned.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"On March 10, 2020, a 50-year-old man, positive for SARS-CoV-2, was admitted to Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital (Wuhan, China) after 47 days of cough and fever (). On February 15, nucleic acid results for SARS-CoV-2 were positive. Previous treatments included arbidol (0.2 g, thrice daily) and lianhua qingwen granules (6 g, thrice daily). On admission, peripheral oxygen saturation was 96% in ambient air and respiratory rate was 18 breaths/minute. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels for SARS-CoV-2 were, respectively, 53.12 g/L and 173.69 g/L (normal range for both: <10 g/L; Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China). Computed tomography (CT) findings showed a bilateral, scattered, high-density shadow and fiber- and spine-like opacities. From March 10 to 22, convalescent plasma from COVID-19 patients (200 mL, March 17 and 18), recombinant human interferon (0.3 mL, atomized inhalation, once daily), lianhua qingwen granules (6 g, thrice daily), and arbidol (2 tablets, thrice daily) were administered as treatment; on March 23, chloroquine phosphate (2 tablets, twice daily) was administered instead of arbidol. On March 23, SARS-CoV-2 RNA were positive. A CT scan showed substantial improvement, with no obvious pulmonary lesions, on March 24. He was treated with ritonavir-boosted danoprevir (DNVr) alone (100/100 mg, one tablet twice daily). From April 3 to 5, nucleic acid test results for SARS-CoV-2 were all negative. SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG levels were markedly reduced (5.38 g/L and 108.68 g/L, respectively). On April 7, he was discharged from the hospital after three consecutively negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The duration from positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA to three consecutive negative results was 55 days.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 56-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure developed a gradual decrease in vision in her left eye over a 2-month period prior to her first examination. Two weeks prior to her first visit, she developed left eye pain, radiating upward. She negated headaches, diplopia, or problems with her right eye. She was currently on insulin, antihypertensive medication, and aspirin. The results of the first ophthalmologic examination revealed optic disc edema and RAPD in the left eye. Visual acuity was 0.8 in the right eye and 0.13 in the left eye.
Initial laboratory testing included syphilis serology, Lyme disease (Borrelia antibodies), determination of HGB, electrolyte status, ACE, blood count, CRP, and ESR. The results of all the tests were negative or normal except Lyme disease serology (IgG 239 (pos), IgM 9 (neg)), low ACE (2 U/L), and eosinophilic cells (high).
An MRI performed 1 week later revealed enlargement and enhancement in the left nerve sheath from the eye to the chiasma, in line with the findings seen in OPN ( and ).
At a new consultation 1 month after her first visit, BCVA was unchanged. A visual field test revealed a general constriction of the visual field of the left eye, with equivalent neural capacity of 99% in his right eye and 33% in his left eye. Fundus examination showed progression of the left optic disc edema (). RAPD was still present. New laboratory tests that included ESR, CRP, ACE, and sarcoidosis revealed nothing abnormal.
One month later, 2 months after her first examination, the left optic disc edema had regressed but an RAPD was still present. Visual acuity was unchanged since her last visit. Treatment with prednisone was initiated, 60 mg/day, which was tapered to 25 mg/day over 4 weeks when she was examined again.
At a fourth consultation, 3 months after her first visit, visual acuity was 0.8 in both eyes. A SST color vision test revealed that the patient had more defective color vision in her left eye (35 p), compared to the right (15 p). The optic disc edema was reduced. The steroid dose was tapered to 5 mg/day during 3 weeks. At this point, the patient suffered her first relapse with dimmed vision in her left eye. Fundus examination 1 week later revealed a pale papilla. BCVA was now 0.8 in her right eye and 0.4 in her left eye. Steroid dose was increased to 30 mg/day and tapered to 20 mg/day until the next appointment 2 weeks later. Some days later, the patient was hospitalized with arrhythmia due to hypercalcemia and hyperkalemia. At the new consultation, visual acuity was 0.8 in her right eye and 0.5 in her left eye.
The steroid dose was lowered with 2.5 mg per week. At 10 mg/day, she suffered a second relapse and received intravenous steroids. Her corticosteroid dose was increased to 30 mg/day in addition to azathioprine (150 mg/day). A fundus examination 3 months later revealed a normal optic disc with no edema. One month later, the steroid dose had been tapered to 17.5 mg/day. BCVA was 0.8 in both eyes. An SST color vision test revealed defective color vision in both the right (30 p) and the left eye (40 p). The fundus examination showed no sign of optic disc edema.
Four months later, it was suspected that the patient was suffering from sarcoidosis. Liver and spleen biopsies were positive for granulomas.
Four months later, she had a third relapse. She was taking 150 mg azathioprine and no corticosteroids at this time. Both eyes were affected; BCVA was 0.4 in her left eye and 0.65 in her right eye. A fundus examination revealed blurred borders of the optic discs in both eyes.
At a new consultation 2 months later, she remained on azathioprine, 150 mg/day, and was taken off corticosteroids. BCVA was 0.5 in her right eye and 0.65 in her left eye. Fundus examination showed no optic disc edema. A new MRI added support to the OPN diagnosis.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"This patient, a five-year-old African-American female, fell at school and developed severe left knee pain. Three days after falling, the patient's mother contacted her primary-care physician where she reported her daughter's severe left knee pain that prevented her from walking and had worsened since the initial injury. At this point, the patient's left knee was also warm and erythematous. She and her daughter were referred to her local emergency department where radiographs of the patient's left knee were conducted and were read as unremarkable with no signs of trauma (). The patient was, therefore, diagnosed with a left knee sprain and was treated conservatively with pain control (ice and NSAIDs) and NWB without further intervention.
Eleven days later, the patient was seen by her primary-care physician for her persistent limp and intermittent pain, although her swelling had resolved. Anteroposterior view of the pelvis and bilateral frog lateral radiographs were ordered to rule out any hip pathologies, which could also cause an antalgic gait. All films were read by an attending radiologist and were deemed unremarkable. Relying on these reads, the primary-care physician recommended the patient to continue supportive care (NSAIDs and ice for pain, nonweight bearing for left lower extremity) and to refer to an orthopedist if symptoms persisted.
Despite these treatments, the patient's pain and limp persisted, and the patient then sought a referral to a general pediatric orthopedist for further work-up. Although the child's pain had slightly improved, her limp remained. She described her left knee pain as worse at night but responsive to acetaminophen and ice. She had never felt anything like this before prior to her initial fall. Both the patient and her mother denied fever, weight loss, fatigue, malaise, or recent infection. On physical exam, her left knee did not have a palpable mass, muscle atrophy, or edema, but was tender to palpation. Given concern for the persistent pain and antalgic gait, repeat radiographs of the left knee were also ordered by the orthopedist and showed aggressive poorly defined lytic lesion centered within the left distal femur metadiaphysis extending up proximally 6 cm superiorly from the metaphysis with associated interrupted superior periosteal involvement (). A radiologist reviewed these findings and agreed with the orthopedist that based on these radiographic findings, there was concern for a primary bone malignancy. Arthrocentesis of the left knee was performed to rule out a possible infectious etiology, which was negative. Acute-phase reactants including c-reactive protein, sedimentation rate, and leukocyte count were all within normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and needle biopsy were ordered to establish diagnosis. Contrast-enhanced MRI examination showed a enhancing mass centered in the distal femoral metaphysis approximately 7 cm in craniocaudal dimension with aggressive periosteal involvement (). Needle biopsy of the left distal femur was performed at the site of the lesion, and pathology demonstrated cores of tumor tissue consisting of pleomorphic tumor cells with frequent mitoses, foci of necrosis, regions of chondroblastic differentiation, and rare small foci of malignant osteoid production, consistent with the diagnosis of osteosarcoma. Additional imaging, including chest computerized tomography (CT) and whole body Positron Emission Tomography (PET), was obtained for tumor staging and demonstrated no evidence of distant metastases.
The patient was then referred to an orthopedic surgeon to discuss treatment options including oncologic and operative interventions. Given the concern for pathological fracture and possible subsequent contamination of healthy tissue from this tumor, the patient was placed in a knee immobilizer to limit weight bearing (NWB LLE with walker). The patient and her parents were referred to an oncologist to determine a chemotherapy plan. A typical treatment plan of osteosarcoma involves surgical resection and six cycles of chemotherapy (two cycles preoperatively as neoadjuvant therapy and four cycles postoperatively) with high-dose methotrexate, doxorubicin/dexrazoxane, and cisplatin.
Operative treatments were discussed between the family and the attending orthopaedic surgeon in great detail including potential risks and benefits, and the family chose to proceed with Van Nes Rotationplasty. Radical resection of the left distal femur 17 cm from the joint line with femur/tibia osteoplasty with internal fixation and Van Nes Rotationplasty of the left lower extremity and left sciatic neuroplasty was performed. The procedure lasted around eight hours long without complications. Estimated blood loss was 100 mL or less. The patient was transferred to the PICU for monitoring postoperatively. There were no wound complications postoperatively, and the patient received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and cefepime for antibiotic prophylaxis. Nine days later, the patient was discharged with referrals to physical therapy and the appropriative postoperative wound care instructions.
The patient was treated with chemotherapy for five months postoperatively and responded well. Since finishing chemotherapy treatments, the patient has continued with physical therapy and has been fitted for a lower extremity prosthetic. Postoperative radiographs have demonstrated appropriate healing of the rotationplasty (). Six-month postoperative Positron Emission Tomography (PET) showed no evidence of local or distant metastatic disease. There was minimal uptake in the left lower extremity at the location of the rotationplasty. The procedure with the appropriate adjuvant chemotherapy was deemed successful.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"This is a 57-year-old male patient from eastern Morocco, followed up for 10 years for ankylosing spondylitis and admitted to the emergency room for an occlusive syndrome and abdominal pain. The symptomatology goes back two years with the onset of intermittent postprandial abdominal pain in the right iliac fossa which worsened on the day of his admission to the hospital. The clinical examination of our patient revealed tenderness in the right iliac fossa with palpation of a mobile mass measuring about 4 cm and free hernial orifices. The standard biological assessment carried out in the emergency room had objectified an inflammatory syndrome with a CRP increased to 60 mg/L and the CT scan had objectified a cockade image next to the last ileal handle. This image, which is probably related to an ileo-ileal invagination, is also the site of a circumferential thickening, regular symmetrical, measuring 14 mm in maximum thickness with respect for the adjacent fat and without individualization of peri-lesional lymphadenopathy (Figure ).
After multidisciplinary discussion and discussion with the patient, we opted for surgical exploration performed under general anesthesia which had demonstrated an intussusception 50 cm from the last intestinal loop on an intraluminal process with mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Bowel resection with lymphadenectomy involving intussusception with manual anastomosis was performed (Figures , ).
The pathological study noted the presence of an inflammatory pseudo-polyp integrating into chronic inflammatory bowel disease Crohn's type (Figures , ). The patient's postoperative progress course was uneventful, our patient was satisfied with the overall care and the discharge was carried out for five days under specific medical treatment for Crohn's disease. Follow-up after two years was without abnormalities with control of rheumatological and digestive manifestations.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 15-year-old East African boy was referred to our hospital with a diagnosis of recurrent TB. Upon review, the patient was found to have a history of productive cough and intermittent low-grade evening fevers for one year and shortness of breath for one week prior to presentation. One year and five months prior to his presentation to our hospital, he had presented to a peripheral hospital with similar symptoms and had been diagnosed with sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and smear-positive TB. He had been treated with anti-TB medications, which brought him only mild relief. Two months after completing anti-TB therapy, his cough and fevers worsened, for which a re-treatment regimen of anti-TB medications, including two months of intramuscular streptomycin, were started on the basis of clinical findings. The sputum examination for AFB had not been repeated. Four months into the course of his second course of anti-TB therapy, the patient stopped taking his medications because he reportedly experienced only mild relief of his symptoms. Repeat Ziehl-Neelsen staining performed two months prior to his admission to our institution was negative for AFB, and no more drugs were given. One week prior to his admission to our hospital, the patient developed progressively worsening shortness of breath, which was even worse while he was lying flat and was associated with dull left-sided chest pain.
His social history was significant for crushing stones (rock cutting) for two years, but he had no history of smoking or working in the mining industry. He had no history of TB or other lung disease in his family.
His physical examination revealed that he was fully conscious, afebrile, slightly wasted, and dyspneic. His oxygen saturation level was 96% on room air, and his other vital signs were normal. His respiratory examination revealed a respiratory rate of 25 cycles/minute and chest bulging on his left side, but his trachea was centrally located. Other findings on the left side included decreased chest expansion, increased tactile vocal fremitus, dull percussion note, and bronchial breath sounds. The rest of the respiratory examination was unremarkable.
The patient was admitted to the medical ward with a diagnosis of recurrent TB with massive left-sided consolidation. A complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 8.7 cells/mm3 with a differential of 69% neutrophils, 23% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, and 1% eosinophils. His hemoglobin level was 10.6 g/dL, and his platelet count was 504 cells/mm3. His erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 20 mm/hour. His renal and liver function tests were within normal ranges. A rapid test for HIV was performed and was negative. Sputum tests for Gram staining and Ziehl-Neelsen staining were both negative. A chest radiograph revealed features of huge left-sided consolidation with complete opacification of the left hemithorax (Figure ). His chest ultrasound revealed that the left lung was completely consolidated. There was no pleural or pericardial effusion, and his right lung was completely normal. Following these examinations, the patient was empirically re-started on the retreatment regimen for recurrent TB, and the cardiothoracic surgery team was consulted about performing a lung biopsy. The cardiothoracic surgery team felt that the patient was too unstable for surgery and requested that medical management be continued until the patient's condition improved.
On hospital day 3, the patient's condition started deteriorating, with worsening shortness of breath, wheezing, and hypoxia (oxygen saturation 82% to 90% on room air). He was admitted to the intensive care unit, where his anti-TB medications were continued, together with oxygen therapy. On hospital day 7, the patient died before any further intervention could be performed.
A post-mortem examination was performed by the hospital's pathologists. As shown in Figures and , the histopathologic examination revealed a huge mass in the left lung with necrosis and suppurative caseation. Microscopic examination of caseous material was negative for AFB. PAS staining was positive and cytological examination revealed yeast cells and capsules of non-viable fungi, suggestive of H. capsulatum. Because of resource limitations at our hospital, no further tests could be performed. The pathologist's impression was that the patient had had pulmonary histoplasmosis.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"We present the case of a 63-year-old female with prior percutaneous revascularizations after a single vein bypass graft to the left anterior descending artery, presented with Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Angina Grade III. Physical examination and laboratory were unremarkable. She had a history of known, severe, life-threatening anaphylactic reactions to previous iodinated dye usage leading to respiratory arrest requiring intubation (despite adequate prophylaxis with steroids and antihistamines). Given her prior history of anaphylactic reaction to iodinated contrast, progressive escalation of medical therapy without repeat angiography was recommended. However, the patient continued to experience a progressive decline in quality of life despite maximal medical therapy. Therefore, coronary and bypass graft angiography was recommended. Coronary and bypass graft angiography was performed using 24 cc of undiluted Gadodiamide (OMNISCAN) with a power injector (ACIST®) without any incidents or premedication. The patient’s coronary artery disease was essentially unchanged from her prior angiogram () and further intensification of anti-anginal therapy was recommended. Patient was monitored for 24 hours for arrhythmia and had repeat renal function in 24 hours and one-week post procedure, were within the normal limits.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 13-year-old girl presented with a history of abdominal distension, back ache, and loss of appetite and weight of 3 months’ duration. Her medical history was otherwise unremarkable. On examination, an ill-defined mass of 10 cm × 8 cm size was palpable in the right hypochondrial region, extending 7 cm below the right costal margin and medially up to the umbilical region. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed a large, heterogeneous mass of 18 cm × 16 cm × 16 cm size arising from the right adrenal, infiltrating the right lobe of liver, and displacing the right kidney inferolaterally.
Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the adrenal mass showed clusters of malignant cells forming rosettes in an eosinophilic fibrillary background with high nuclear cytoplasmic ratio. In addition, scattered ganglion cells with eccentric-placed nuclei and prominent nucleoli were also present and features were consistent with ganglioneuroblastoma [].
The 24-h urinary vanillyl mandelic acid VMA level was 5.4 mg/24 h (normal is < 7 mg/24 h). Radiography of the lumbo-sacral spine showed mixed lytic and sclerotic lesion involving the L3 vertebrae [] and confirmed by computed tomography (CT) soft tissue with bone window []. To assess the extent of neuroblastoma and metastasis, PET-CT was done. It showed [Figures and ] increased uptake in the right adrenal and liver areas with metastatic involvement of L3 vertebrae. These imaging findings and FNAC reflected the diagnosis of ganglioneuroblastoma; stage IV (vertebral and liver metastasis). The patient was treated with intravenous zoledronic acid[] and carboplatin, vincristine, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide[] based chemotherapy regimen.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 26-year-old man arrived at the emergency department with a seven-day history of hematemesis and melena. He had no previous medical history and did not drink alcohol or used any illicit drug or medication.
Physical examination on admission showed blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg, a temperature of 36°C (96.8°F), a pulse rate of 90/min, and a respiratory rate of 22/min; his height was 1.75 m, weight 98 kg, and BMI 32 kg/m2. He experienced pain with deep palpation in the epigastrium and no organomegaly or lymphadenopathy was identified. The left scrotal sac was enlarged and indurated and there was a mass in the left scrotum that was indistinguishable from the left testis and provoked displacement of structures of the penis and right testis (the right scrotum was empty). No inguinal lymphadenopathy was identified.
Laboratory tests revealed normal liver function. Hemoglobin was 9.13 g/dl, MCV was 87.9 fL, WBC was 11.9 K/uL, neutrophils were 9.81 K/uL, lymphocyte count was 1.59 K/uL, and platelet level was 252 K/uL. Serum glucose level was 106 mg/dl, BUN was 38 mg/dl, creatinine was 0.9 mg/dl, and calcium was 8.9 mg/dl. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was 17,090 ng/mL, lactate dehydrogenase was 1480 U/L (normal range: 91–180 IU/L), and human chorionic gonadotropin level was 287.4 IU/mL.
After resuscitation with crystalloid solutions, he underwent upper endoscopy. The gastroenterologist found abundant active bleeding, for which orotracheal intubation was decided to provide airway protection. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. A second upper endoscopy revealed a type 1 isolated gastric varix, treated with cyanoacrylate without complications ().
A scrotal US showed a large heterogeneous image in the left testicle area, with an echogenic and cystic solid component and flow presence with color Doppler assessment.
A contrasted CT scan of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis showed a liver of normal size and density with multiple retrocrural, retroperitoneal, mesenteric, and left iliac metastatic lymphadenopathy which caused extrinsic compression of the portal vein along with splenic vein partial thrombosis with left-sided portal hypertension and perigastric and perisplenic collateral neovascularization (). A heterogeneous, well defined mass was found in the left testicle, 16.7 × 16.1 × 14.9 cm, with a solid component that was enhanced with the administration of contrast, as well as a cystic component. There was also invasion of the left spermatic cord.
The patient was extubated after surveillance and transferred to the Internal Medicine Department. We started chemotherapy with etoposide 100 mg/m2 and cisplatin 20 mg/m2, and seven days later the patient underwent a left radical orchiectomy by an inguinal approach with left hemiscrotectomy, without complications. Following this intervention, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was reduced to 350 ng/mL, and the human chorionic gonadotropin level was 50 IU/mL.
A postoperative biopsy showed a pure testicular teratoma () with glandular formations and the presence of cartilage (a) and respiratory epithelium, with ciliated columnar cells alternating with goblet cells (b).
The patient was discharged after showing clinical improvement to receive ambulatory chemotherapy.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"We present the case of a 74-year-old Caucasian male presenting with a 2-year history of left knee pain. He described difficulty kneeling and descending stairs. On examination, a tender and mildly diffuse swelling was present over the left patella associated with mild erythema. The patient was able to perform a straight leg raise test and had full range of movement of the left knee. Ligamentous and meniscal testing was unremarkable as was examination of the ipsilateral hip.
Nineteen months earlier the patient had consulted his general practitioner complaining of left knee pain. Radiographs performed at that time were reported to show joint space narrowing within the patello-femoral compartment as well as early joint space narrowing within the medial compartment. A subchondral lucency was also noted within the patella which was described as a subarticular cyst secondary to the previously mentioned patello-femoral degeneration (Figs –).
The patient had a past history of prostate cancer, diagnosed in October 2005. He had been successfully treated and discharged from follow-up. In August 2007 he underwent excision of a basal cell carcinoma and had a permanent pacemaker for bradyarrhythmia. His only regular medication was a statin. Overall, he enjoyed good health and considered himself very active. There were no symptoms or signs of systemic disease.
Repeat radiographs performed by his general practitioner 19 months after initial presentation (Figs –) revealed a large lucency within the patella and a discontinuity in the anterior cortex of the inferior pole suggesting pathological fracture. A bone scan was arranged and demonstrated isolated abnormal tracer activity around the left patella (Fig. ). Due to the pacemaker a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed to further characterize the lesion. This confirmed a large lucent area occupying most of the patella with multiple areas of cortical disruption along its anterior border (Fig. ). Since the exact nature of the lesion could not be determined an ultrasound-guided biopsy was suggested but ultrasound screening revealed the lesion to be highly vascular (Fig. ). In view of this the radiologist performed a renal ultrasound, which revealed a large mass arising from the superior pole of the left kidney. Subsequent CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis followed demonstrating the extent of disease. There was a large (13 × 8.5 × 9 cm) mass arising from the superior pole of the left kidney (Fig. ), the appearances of which were consistent with a primary RCC. Metastases were found in both adrenals and lungs, but no other bone metastases. Since diagnosis, the patient has had a left nephrectomy and is currently receiving radiotherapy and zolendronic acid treatment for the patella metastasis. At the time of writing this report the patient's patella lesion continues to be managed non-operatively.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 47 year-old woman developed left side weakness after a right ACA infarction and was transferred to the department of rehabilitation medicine 3 weeks post onset. She had no remarkable medical history but was diagnosed with diabetes at our hospital. She had no family history of stroke. On transfer to our department, her mental status was alert but she had mild attention deficit. Her speech was normal and a K-MMSE score was 25. MMT grades of her left upper and lower extremities were all 3/5, except the wrist flexor and wrist extensor scores were both 2/5. She could perform fine motor activity with her left hand. She had no spasticity in her elbow and knee joints, with a MAS score of zero. Her deep tendon reflex was normoactive. Her superficial sensory responses were intact, but proprioception was impaired. She complained that her left hand was out of her control; her left hand ""took away"" objects out of her right hand. Her hands appeared to be directed at opposing purposes, showing 'intermanual conflict'. A brain MRI revealed acute cerebral infarction at the right ACA region, mainly at the right frontal lobe and corpus callosum (). In this case, when we stimulated the right motor cortex area, the rMT was 44% and the MEP amplitude was 314 µV. At the left motor cortex area, the rMT was 44% and the MEP amplitude was 456 µV. In the ICF study, when we stimulated the right motor cortex area, the MEP amplitude was increased to 876 µV. In the ICI study, theamplitude was not suppressed, but rather increased to 867 µV (). The SEP studies using median
nerve stimulation were normal with no significant differences between sides ().","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 55-year old male presented to an academic medical center in February 2020 with a six-week history of increasing midline back pain. He had a history of chronic mid- and lower back pain as the result of degenerative disc disease, however his pain had abruptly worsened in the 6 weeks prior to presentation. Pain was worsened with trying to sit up straight or walk. Pain was partially relieved with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and oxycodone 5 mg tablets taken as needed. He reported no associated fevers, chills, or night sweats. He did not recall a febrile illness prior to the onset of symptoms. He did report anorexia and 15-pound weight loss in the last 6 weeks. His medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic hepatitis C infection, hyperlipidemia, generalized anxiety disorder, and lumbar degenerative disc disease. His surgical history was notable for cervical spine laminectomy in the remote past. His social history was notable for heavy and ongoing tobacco use with a 60 pack-year smoking history. He denied alcohol or illicit drug use including intravenous drug use.
He was afebrile and hemodynamically stable on presentation. Physical exam revealed a gaunt Caucasian male in moderate distress due to pain. Poor dentition was noted. His cardiopulmonary examination was unremarkable. On spinal examination, no bony tenderness was elicited upon palpation of the thoracic and lumbar spine, however paraspinal tenderness was noted in the lumbar spine. Neurologic examination including strength and sensation of the lower extremities was intact. Babinski reflex was downward bilaterally.
MRI with and without gadolinium contrast revealed abnormal enhancement of the lower endplate of the L2 vertebral body as well as diffuse enhancement of the L3 vertebral body with irregularity of the upper endplate. This abnormal enhancement extended to the intervertebral disc. Findings were suggestive of discitis with osteomyelitis not excluded. Additionally, there was enhancement and thickening in the anterior epidural space measuring 2 mm × 4 mm which may represent epidural abscess or hematoma (Fig. ). Laboratory evaluation including CBC with differential and comprehensive metabolic panel was unremarkable. Sedimentation rate was 36 mm/hr. and C-reactive protein was 30.1 mg/L. Blood cultures were sterile.
Based on initial results of clinical, laboratory, and radiographic evaluation, antibiotic therapy was withheld. CT-guided aspiration of the L2-L3 disc was performed for culture and histopathology. Gram stain revealed Gram variable rods. Histopathology revealed fibrocartilage with degenerative changes and acute inflammation suggestive of discitis (Fig. ). He was seen in Infectious Diseases outpatient consultation, initially offered intravenous antibiotic therapy however patient requested oral antibiotic therapy for empiric treatment of discitis. He was started on treatment with cephalexin 1 g by mouth three times a day as well as linezolid 600 mg by mouth twice a day. (Initially, prior to the revelation of RBF infection, linezolid was chosen (in addition to cephalexin) because Gram stain revealed Gram-positive rods. The intention was to cover Corynebacterium spp. and coagulase-negative staphylococci, skin flora which tend to have resistance to beta-lactams but susceptibility to vancomycin or linezolid.) Cultures were sent to a reference laboratory, with growth noted on Mueller-Hinton media with 5% sheep blood. The organism was identified as Streptobacillus moniliformis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF). On further history, it was revealed that patient had two pet rats and had sustained numerous bites in the last 1 year prior to symptom onset. In vitro susceptibility testing using broth microdilution revealed low MIC for penicillin (< 0.06 μg/ml), ampicillin (< 0.12 μg/ml), and ceftriaxone (< 0.06 μg/ml), with elevated MIC > 4 μg/mL for gentamicin. The patient’s symptoms dramatically improved with cephalexin so a decision was made not to switch to oral or IV penicillin. Linezolid was discontinued after 2 weeks once culture results were available. He completed 6 weeks of oral cephalexin therapy with dramatic improvement of back pain. The patient was offered TEE to evaluate for endocarditis. However, he declined to have the test done as this coincided with the onset of CoVID-19 pandemic.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 67-year-old man presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and cardiogenic shock. His heart rate was around 120 to 130/min, and his systolic blood pressure was around 70 to 80 mm Hg even though vasoactive agent use. The patient developed pulmonary edema and progressed to profound cardiogenic shock status within 2 hours. Electrocardiography showed diffuse ST-segment depression in precordial leads and Q-wave in inferior leads. His coronary risk factors include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. He received intubation and ventilator support due to impending respiratory failure. IABP was set before diagnostic coronary angiography (CAG). CAG revealed severe calcified RCA subtotal occlusion at middle portion, with retrograde collaterals from the distal portion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) (Fig. A). From the distal LM to the mid LAD, there was a long tubular severe calcified 80% stenosis (Fig. B) and concomitant hypoplastic left circumflex artery (LCX) chronic total occlusion (CTO) without significant collaterals from LAD or RCA (Fig. C). Transthoracic 2-dimensional echocardiography revealed poor left ventricular performance and global hypokinesis with LVEF of 23%. His SYNTAX score (synergy between percutaneous coronary intervention with TAXUS and cardiac surgery) was 43, and the EuroScore (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation) was 20 (estimated perioperative mortality rate 20%–38%). The patient and his family refused coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Due to unstable hemodynamic condition, ECMO were set up immediately.
Coronary intervention was performed via right transradial (TR) approach because both femoral arteries were used for ECMO and IABP. A 6-French (Fr.) Ikari IL 3.5 guiding catheter (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was used for engaging the left main ostium. Tirofiban was used for intracoronary bolus and intravenous maintenance. After advancing a 0.014 Runthrough Floppy wire (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) to the distal LAD, sequential dilatation was performed using Maverick 2.5 × 20 mm (Boston Scientific, New York, USA) up to 18 atm, NC Sprinter 2.75 × 12 mm (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) up to 18 atm, NC Sprinter 3.0 × 12 mm (Medtronic) up to 20 atm, and Quantum 3.5 × 8 mm (Boston Scientific, USA) up to 28 atm. All of these balloons ruptured and long linear dissection occurred. Two drug-eluting stents (DES) Taxus Liberte (Boston Scientific, USA) 2.75 × 28 mm and 3.0 × 32 mm were deployed at mid LAD to distal LM, and subsequently, postdilatation of the in-stent portion up to 30 atm by Quantum (Boston Scientific, USA) 3.0 × 8 mm, 3.25 × 8 mm, and 3.5 × 8 mm balloons. Intra-vascular ultrasound (IVUS) and angiography (Fig. D) revealed that 2 stents were well deployed and well apposed to the vessel wall (Fig. E–H) with retrograde collaterals to the distal RCA.
We performed PCI for the difficult lesion of RCA to complete revascularization due to cardiogenic shock. A hydrophilic wire Pilot 50 (Abbott, Chicago, IL) was successfully advanced to the distal posterior descending artery with a 6 Fr. Ikari IL 3.5 guiding catheter (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) via the right TR approach. An Ottimo 1.5 × 10 mm balloon (Kaneka, Osaka, Japan) and a Maverick 2.0 × 20 mm balloon (Boston Scientific, USA) were used for dilatation of the lesions from mid RCA to proximal RCA up to 18 atm. Because the RCA was much angulated with an epsilon shape (Fig. A) and linear dissection occurred after balloon angioplasty, we tried to deploy stents from the distal to the ostium RCA but failed. Even though we employed methods such as 2 guidewire technique, balloon anchoring technique, 5-in-6 technique using 5Fr. ST01 catheter (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan), and deep-seating technique to deploy stents (including one drug-eluting stent), but all were unsuccessful when applied separately. Therefore, we proceeded to apply 3 techniques in combination (balloon anchoring technique, 5-in-6 technique, and deep-seating technique) to deploy the first stent Vision 2.75 × 18 mm (short stent) (Abbott) at the most angulated portion (Fig. B) which attributed the success of deploying other 4 stents from the distal to the ostium RCA: pixel 2.5 × 23 mm (Abbott), micro-Driver 2.5 × 24 mm (Medtronic, USA), Vision 3.0 × 28 mm, and Vision 3.5 × 12 mm. After high-pressure dilatation of the in-stent portion, IVUS and angiography (Fig. C) revealed that the 5 stents were well deployed and well apposed to the vessel wall (Fig. D–H).
We removed IABP and ECMO until cardiac contractile function improved to left ventricular ejection fraction over 40 percentage after 1 week. The patient was discharged after 2 months and had survival for 5 years.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 23-year-old male presented with complaint of cough with purulent expectoration, breathlessness on exertion, history of wheezing sound coming from chest, and low-grade fever of 3 weeks' duration. There was no previous history of such episodes or any other significant illness in the past. On admission, his vital signs were: Pulse rate 62 beats/min, blood pressure 128/72 mmHg, respiratory rate 24 breaths/min, and body temperature 36.5°C. Systemic examination showed bilateral expiratory wheeze on lung field auscultation. Routine laboratory tests revealed eosinophilia (57.5%) with absolute eosinophil count (AEC) of 7180/cu mm. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 10 mm fall in the first hour. A sputum smear for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and protozoa was negative. Sputum culture did not grow any organism. Peripheral blood smear showed no evidence of microfilarial parasite. Viral markers including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), and hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV) test were negative. Chest X-ray [] and noncontrast computed tomography (CT) of chest were normal. Spirometry was normal. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were done for evaluation of eosinophilia with respiratory symptoms. Bronchoscopy showed congestion of the left lower bronchus with mucoid secretion. Microscopic examination of wet mount of BAL revealed actively motile flagellates with polar tuft of flagella lashing rhythmically [], identified as L. blattarum [Figures and ]. Oral metronidazole 400 mg thrice daily was given for 2 weeks. Steady improvement in the patient's condition was noted, with him becoming asymptomatic and the normalization of peripheral eosinophilia after 2 weeks of treatment.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 12-year-old female patient presented from a referring institution in November 2015 for evaluation of 1-month history of an enlarging abdominal mass. The patient reported a 4.5 kg weight loss with increased lethargy. The physical examination was normal except for a large abdominal solid mass. Pelvic CT () revealed a large pelvic mass. Tumor markers were significant for alpha fetoprotein (AFP) 656 ng/mL (nml ≤ 7 ng/mL), CA-125 401 U/mL (nml < 35 U/mL), and CEA 6.7 ng/mL (nml ≤ 3.5 ng/mL). Inhibin A/B and β-HCG levels were normal. She underwent an exploratory laparotomy, right salpingoophorectomy, omentectomy, peritoneal washings, diaphragmatic/peritoneal/pelvic biopsies, and periaortic lymph node biopsy. Intraoperative findings were significant for a distinct right ovarian mass with evidence of prior rupture. Ascites was noted and aspirated. There was peritoneal seeding along the pelvis and right pericolic gutter and along the right hemidiaphragm. Gross residual disease remained consisting mostly of the peritoneal seeding despite removal of all gross abdominal disease. The cytology examination of the peritoneal fluid demonstrated no malignant cells. Histologically, all the pathology specimens returned with high grade immature teratoma (). She was diagnosed as grade 3, FIGO stage IIIC. Chromosome analysis returned trisomy 3 in four of her autosomal cells, consistent with the diagnosis of immature teratoma. Since there is currently no “standard of care” for pediatric grade immature teratoma FIGO stage IIIC, we elected to follow tumor markers closely. Following tumor markers, her AFP fell by approximately 50% every week almost normalizing over the course of three months from diagnosis (from 656 ng/mL to 9.78 ng/mL). In January 2016, repeat tumor marker labs demonstrated that AFP levels increased to 28.3 ng/mL and CA-125/β-HCG were within normal limits (18 units/mL CA-125, <3 units/mL). Repeat CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed that, in the abdomen and pelvis, she now had enlarged peritoneal implants, as large as 3.5 × 1.5 cm, but no other masses, and, in the chest, she had a 1.3 × 2 × 0.3 cm left anterior pleural nodule, as well as bilateral diaphragmatic lesions, 2.5 × 2.1 × 1.8 cm on right and 2.1 × 3 × 1.5 cm on left. She subsequently underwent chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) between February and May 2016 for high risk malignant ovarian germ cell tumor. After 4 cycles, her AFP was 0.84 ng/mL.
After 4 cycles, she underwent interval radiologic evaluation in preparation for second look surgery. The CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis in May 2016 revealed a significant increase in the size of the thoracic masses, as well as the size and a number of abdominal and pelvic masses (). The largest mass was 7.9 × 7.7 × 8.7 cm in the rectouterine pouch with evidence of fat and calcification. There was also a 4.4 × 7.2 × 6.6 cm peritoneal implant superior to the liver that also had similar visual findings. There were also findings of bilateral cardiophrenic masses, with the largest measuring 2.1 × 1.3 × 1.1 cm. In June 2016, she underwent a second debulking procedure consisting of complete infracolic omentectomy, para-aortic lymph node dissection, hepatic mass resection, and pelvic tumor removal on the right side. Gross residual disease remained in her abdomen and pelvis, since she had innumerous peritoneal studding, and thus her thoracic tumors were not removed. A total of 5 pelvic masses and 3 liver masses were excised, and pathologic analysis indicated mature teratoma (). At the time of surgery her liver masses were found to compress the parenchyma of the liver and were not invasive.
Due to the massive growth of tumor in 4 months, as well as recently undergoing 2 major surgical debulkings, and still being unable to completely resect her tumors, medical treatment was discussed with the patient and her parents. In an attempt to prevent regrowth of her tumors, in August 2016, the patient was started on experimental protocol #009 of the Neuroblastoma and Medulloblastoma Translational Research Consortium (NMTRC). This treatment regimen consists of temozolomide 40 mg/m2 PO daily (days 1–28), tretinoin 25 mg/m2/day PO BID (days 1–14), and sorafenib 150 mg/m2 PO BID (days 1–28). Thalidomide was started during cycle 2. This protocol was chosen as this study tests the feasibility of experimental technologies to determine a tumor's molecular makeup. This technology includes a genomic report based on DNA exomes and RNA sequencing that will be used to discover new ways to understand cancers and potentially predict the best treatments for patients with cancer in the future. Prior to the experimental therapeutics, a CT scan was obtained to evaluate disease progression. She is currently without new tumor growths.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 73-year-old female patient came to the outpatient department with complaints of lower abdominal pain, blood in stools, and whitish discharge through vagina for 10 days. On examination patient's vitals were stable. The patient underwent a CECT scan abdomen which revealed irregular wall thickening involving the rectosigmoid region for a length of ~ 7 cm, with wall thickness of ~ 18 mm. There was loss of fat plane between the uterus and the thickened rectosigmoid colon with air pockets within the endometrial cavity []. Mesocolic fat and perirectal fat stranding was also seen with multiple adjacent subcentimetric lymph nodes. Based on CT findings, possibility of rectosigmoid malignancy and colouterine fistula was considered. The sigmoidoscopy and biopsy of the lesion revealed infiltrating moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of colon. The en bloc resection of the uterus and sigmoid colon with colostomy was performed on the patient and adjuvant chemotherapy started.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"An 84-year-old male patient with past medical history consisting of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and open angle glaucoma was admitted to ICU via A & E with an unwitnessed collapse and decreased level of consciousness. In emergency department (ED) his GCS was recorded as 5/15, blood sugar was found to be only 34 mg/dL, his heart rate was 34 beats per minutes (bpm), and BP was 58/43 mm Hg. His ECG showed sinus bradycardia with variable blocks including sinus node dysfunction and type 1 Mobitz heart block pattern (Figures and ). He was intubated and ventilated in ED and given dextrose 50% 100 mL and 0.5 mg Atropine. His heart rate rose to 88 bpm and with improvement of heart rate and correction of blood sugar his BP became 135/88 and his GCS improved to 13/15. Unfortunately, heart rate started to drop again to 40 s and blood sugar showed a downward trend for which he was given 1 mg glucagon and was transferred to ICU. By the time he reached ICU his heart rate had improved to 90 bpm. In ICU after 30 minutes his heart rate dropped again so he was given another dose of Atropine and a temporary transvenous pace maker (TPM) was inserted. The patient's blood sugar also improved temporarily but eventually required intravenous infusion of 10% dextrose for the next 12 hours before it was stabilized. His GCS improved to 14/15 and he was extubated the next day 16 hours after admission but repeated attempts to switch off his pace maker revealed underlying brady-arrythmias with heart rate dropping to 34–40 bpm associated with presyncopal symptoms comprising of deterioration in attention and episodes of drowsiness. The pace maker was eventually switched off after 26 hours of observation when no more episodes of bradycardia were observed.
A detailed neurological assessment was carried out after extubation which showed the patient to be confused with no motor deficit. His CT brain was done which showed no abnormality and a detailed history was sought from the patient's wife who pointed out that the patient has been behaving in a weird and confused way for the last 5 days but his wife attributed that to demise of one of his close relative who died a week ago. She further added that he stopped taking his oral medications 2 days before he was admitted but he was given his eye drops regularly by his daughter who feared blindness in case the medication was not given. His drug history consisted of Enalapril 10 mg OD, Atorvastatin 10 mg OD, Metformin 500 mg BID, and Timolol Maleate 0.5% one drop each eye twice a day which was started 35 days before admission to ICU when he was diagnosed as a case of glaucoma.
Tilt table test was not carried out and keeping in view his improvement in blood sugar and heart rate after administration of glucagon his clinical picture of hypoglycemia, confusion, and bradyarrhythmia was recognized to be because of ophthalmic Timolol Maleate which was changed to Travoprost (a prostaglandin F2 analogue) after consulting the ophthalmologist.
The patient was kept under observation in ICU for another 24 hours. His intrinsic heart rate improved to 82 bpm and his TPM wire was removed before transferring to ward. Patient's confusion also improved gradually over the next 3 days and he was discharged on Enalapril, Travoprost, and Metformin. His followup for the next two months was unremarkable.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 37-year-old man was admitted to local hospital with weight loss, night sweat,
repeating fever for a week in April 2018. The patient’s initial laboratory
examination showed that leukocyte count was 12.48×109/L with 37%
eosinophilia in the peripheral blood, hemoglobin concentration was 127 g/L and
platelet count was 146×109/L. The initial bone marrow (BM)
aspirates and biopsy showed hyper leukocytes and significantly increased eosinophils
(8%), and neutrophil alkaline phosphatase score was 18 ( and ). Above all, these inspections were consistent with a diagnosis of
MPN. Then the patient was administrated with 20 mg prednisone per day, but it showed
no any effect with white blood cell (WBC) 15.1×109/L, hemoglobin
108 g/L, platelet 114×109/L, eosinophils
5.13×109/L (33.91%) in peripheral blood.
The suite of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay on the
BM aspirate was used to detect BCR-ABL,
PDGFRA, PDGFRB, and FGFR1
rearrangement. MPN FISH assay showed PDGFRB arrangement positive.
The karyotype analysis of BM cells showed 46,XY[20].
Patient’s RNA was extracted from BM cell by Trizol methods according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) for RNA-sequencing
(RNA-seq) in July 2018. RNA quality and concentration were estimated by Nano Drop
ND-2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Paired-end reads were generated
from the complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries using an Illumina Next Seq 550
instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Then we used star-fusion software to analyze
the RNA-seq raw data [] (). Standard
settings were applied for all three tools and reads were aligned to the Genome
Reference Consortium Human Build 37 (GRCh37). RNA-seq revealed that
PDGFRB fused with CSNK2A1 gene. To confirm the
fusion, reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was
performed with CSNK2A1-PDGFRB forward primer:
5′-GTGCCAAGCAGGGCCAGAGT-3′, reverse primer
5′-AGGGTGCGTCCCAGCACAAG-3′. The reciprocal
PDGFRB-CSNK2A1 fusion forward primer:

program ().
Given the existence of PDGFRB fusion, he received imatinib therapy with 200 mg every
day orally in September 2018. Two months later, the laboratory examination showed
that WBC was 6.14×109/L with 2.8% eosinophilia in the peripheral
blood (). Finally, real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR was
performed to quantify the fusion gene and showed negative in 8 months after imatinib

"A 72-year-old Chinese man with chronic nuchal pain complained of progressive difficulty in lifting the head over the last 2 years. He also developed difficulty walking due to the loss of horizontal gaze. Past history was notable for hypertension under control. The patient reported no history of trauma and no known neurological deficits. Prior workup by an orthopedic surgeon and a neurologist excluded the diagnosis of any cranial, neurological or autoimmune diseases. A muscle biopsy from the left trapezius muscle demonstrated nonspecific myopathic features. Cervical collar, oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication and exercise rehabilitation were ineffective in correcting his posture for the past 1 year. The patient then sought chiropractic care for his condition.
Upon examination, the patient ambulated with a cane to maintain balance. Gaze was down at the floor, instead of forward. Pronounced head drop with neck flexion caused the chin to rest on the chest in standing or sitting. The center of gravity plumb line (COG PL, red dashed line) is considered a virtual gravity line of the entire body (). Measurements of cervical range of motion (ROM) showed restriction of active motions, where active versus passive extension ROM (normal range: 70°) was 10°/54°, and active versus passive rotation ROM (normal range: 90° to both sides) was 58°/72° each side. The head was able to be passively raised up by hands and the neck deformity resolved when lying supine. Pain intensity of the neck was rated 3-4/10 on an 11-point numeric pain rating scale, where 0 means no pain and 10 means the worst imaginable pain. Motor strength measurement of the cervical extensors with a handheld dynamometer was graded at 4+/5. The patient could maintain the head up with extreme effort only for a couple of minutes. EOS® radiographies ( and ) revealed reverse lordosis (CobbC2-C7 −16°), cervical disc space narrowing with grade 1 anterolisthesis at C3/4 and C4/5 levels (red arrows), and C5-C6 ankylosis (hollow arrow). COG-C7 sagittal vertical axis (SVACOG-C7) ⩾30 mm (red solid line) is regarded as occiput-trunk discordance and SVAC2-C7 ⩾40 mm (purple solid line) is considered to be cervical sagittal imbalance. Needle electromyography revealed myopathic changes in the cervical muscles. Clinical pictures and histological findings were consistent with INEM associated with cervical spondylosis.
The chiropractic regimen consisted of upper thoracic spine manipulation, electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), cervical extension exercises and cervical collar. The splenius capitis, semispinalis capitis, semispinalis cervicis, and trapezius are the key muscles for cervical extension. In order to correct dropped head posture and relieve neck pain, these muscles need to be strengthened specifically. In the presence of instability at C3/4 and C4/5 levels, cervical manipulation was contraindicated. An upper thoracic manipulation was cautiously delivered instead. An inflatable air pump cervical collar was prescribed to maintain neck posture and to relieve neural compression when patient was at home. Greater functional range of active cervical motion was obtained after 2 weeks of treatment 5 times per week. Subsequently, in addition to manipulative therapy, EMS of the neck extensors and cervical extension exercises for muscle strengthening were added in each treatment session. Treatments were delivered 3 times weekly for further 3 months. Dropped head state was almost corrected and neck pain was fully resolved near the completion of treatment. The patient resumed normal daily activities and continued monthly follow-ups. At the 6-month follow-up, he regained upright posture of the head and global sagittal balance (). Repeat standing full-spine EOS® ( and ) depicted substantial improving of most of the radiographic parameters except SVAC7-S1. The C7 plumb line (white dashed line) should fall within 30 mm, either anterior or posterior, to the posterosuperior endplate of the S1. His SVAC7-S1 moved posteriorly (from −37 to −66 mm), indicating negative sagittal balance.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"The first patient was a 46-year-old male heavy smoker whose chief complaint was pain in his left shoulder and back for 3 months. A chest computerized tomography (CT) revealed a mass in his left upper lung lobe with mediastinal lymph node metastasis. The patient received two cycles of chemotherapy with gemzar and cisplatin followed by radical resection of the left upper lung cancer. His pathological diagnosis was SCLC and immunohistochemical stains revealed that his specimen was positive for synaptophysin and carcinoembryonic antigen and negative for chromogranin A and neuron-specific enolase. The size of the resected tumor was 5×4× 3.5 cm, and his pathological TNM stage was T2aN2M0 (IIIA). After surgery, he received two cycles of chemotherapy (gemzar and cisplatin) and thoracic radiotherapy (planning target volume 56Gy/28F). The patient was followed up for 58 months and is still alive with no recurrence.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 22-year-old female patient was admitted for surgery to revise her Waterston central aortopulmonary shunt. She had the history of TF, pulmonary valve stenosis, ventricular septal defect and major aortopulmonary collateral artery. Her shunt was placed at the age of 5 years then complicated with stenosis for which a stent was placed and re-dilated 1 year ago. After echocardiography reported minimal aorto-pulmonary shunt flow, a decision was made to operate the patient for revision of the central shunt. Midsternal incision was done and a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tube was inserted between the ascending aorta and right pulmonary branch, where the previous Gortex was located. Patient recovery and rehabilitation after surgery was optimal until the patient experienced abrupt left-sided pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea. Arterial O2 saturation diminished to 75%. The patient was referred to the department of nuclear medicine for perfusion and ventilation lung scanning. Perfusion lung scan was done with 4 mCi 99m Technetium labeled macroaggregated albumin (total particle count 120,000) in planar anterior, posterior, lateral and multiple oblique projections (). The left lung was generally hypoperfused more in the upper zone. No clear evidence of PTE was detected in the planar views. Additionally, the brain, renal parenchyma and the thyroid demonstrated uptake due to the right to left shunt (). Ventilation scan was not performed due to logistic problems; the available ventilation tracer in Iran is 81Kr, which is distributed only on Wednesdays. Afterward, a 2-hour delayed SPECT imaging was done (). There was a large wedge-shaped peripheral defect in the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe. The finding was interpreted as either acute/chronic PTE or secondary to developmental/iatrogenic vascular abnormality. Therapeutic dose of intravenous IV heparin was administrated (500 U/hour). Meanwhile, the patient underwent CT angiography reporting postoperative atelectatic changes in the bilateral lower lobes without evidence in support of PTE. The IV heparin was changed to warfarin after 5 days when the symptoms improved gradually and the arterial O2 saturation increased to 92% in room atmosphere. Pulmonary angiography was not performed as the patient was improving. She was discharged with good general condition and no specific pulmonary symptoms.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"The authors report a case of a 73-year-old Caucasian male with background history of type 2 diabetes and arterial hypertension diagnosed with prostatic adenocarcinoma in December 2018. Radical prostatectomy was performed, and the patient was started on hormone therapy with cyproterone and adjuvant radiotherapy (March 2019). He had 1-month history of night sweats and headache and 1-week history of moderate, nonirradiating pain in the anterior thighs and low-grade fever. At examination, the patient was pale, sweaty and had a grade 2/5 panfocal heart murmur. Laboratory tests revealed normocytic normochromic anemia, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), transaminases, C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin. Cultures were drowned, and empirical antibiotics were started. The head CT scan and lumbar CT scan were unremarkable. Blood cultures and serologic tests for atypical agents were negative. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed and showed no valvular vegetations. A thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT scan was performed and showed only moderate hepatomegaly. After ten days of empirical antibiotic with doxycycline and gentamicin, the patient maintained low-grade fever and pain in the anterior thighs with worsening of anemia, SR, and transaminases. The CRP and procalcitonin remained unchanged, and the multidisciplinary team decided to suspend local radiotherapy.
A bone scintigram was performed and suggested the hypothesis of aseptic femoral head necrosis that was excluded with hip MRI. With development of mandibular claudication during the hospital stay, a Doppler ultrasound of the temporal arteries was performed and revealed periluminal hypoechogenic halo reflecting arterial wall edema more pronounced in the left temporal artery (Figure ).
The patient was started on 1 mg/kg of prednisolone with clinical improvement at the first 48 hours and resolution of laboratory abnormalities. It was not possible to perform the temporal artery biopsy until the 10th day of therapy, and it showed only slight lymphocytic infiltration.
Local radiotherapy was restarted, and the patient was discharged home.
Three months later, the patient restarted bilateral hip pain and a lumbosacral spine MRI was performed and revealed new osteoblastic lesions in S1, S2, and S3 compatible with bone metastasis.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"An 84-year-old male patient with past medical history consisting of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and open angle glaucoma was admitted to ICU via A & E with an unwitnessed collapse and decreased level of consciousness. In emergency department (ED) his GCS was recorded as 5/15, blood sugar was found to be only 34 mg/dL, his heart rate was 34 beats per minutes (bpm), and BP was 58/43 mm Hg. His ECG showed sinus bradycardia with variable blocks including sinus node dysfunction and type 1 Mobitz heart block pattern (Figures and ). He was intubated and ventilated in ED and given dextrose 50% 100 mL and 0.5 mg Atropine. His heart rate rose to 88 bpm and with improvement of heart rate and correction of blood sugar his BP became 135/88 and his GCS improved to 13/15. Unfortunately, heart rate started to drop again to 40 s and blood sugar showed a downward trend for which he was given 1 mg glucagon and was transferred to ICU. By the time he reached ICU his heart rate had improved to 90 bpm. In ICU after 30 minutes his heart rate dropped again so he was given another dose of Atropine and a temporary transvenous pace maker (TPM) was inserted. The patient's blood sugar also improved temporarily but eventually required intravenous infusion of 10% dextrose for the next 12 hours before it was stabilized. His GCS improved to 14/15 and he was extubated the next day 16 hours after admission but repeated attempts to switch off his pace maker revealed underlying brady-arrythmias with heart rate dropping to 34–40 bpm associated with presyncopal symptoms comprising of deterioration in attention and episodes of drowsiness. The pace maker was eventually switched off after 26 hours of observation when no more episodes of bradycardia were observed.
A detailed neurological assessment was carried out after extubation which showed the patient to be confused with no motor deficit. His CT brain was done which showed no abnormality and a detailed history was sought from the patient's wife who pointed out that the patient has been behaving in a weird and confused way for the last 5 days but his wife attributed that to demise of one of his close relative who died a week ago. She further added that he stopped taking his oral medications 2 days before he was admitted but he was given his eye drops regularly by his daughter who feared blindness in case the medication was not given. His drug history consisted of Enalapril 10 mg OD, Atorvastatin 10 mg OD, Metformin 500 mg BID, and Timolol Maleate 0.5% one drop each eye twice a day which was started 35 days before admission to ICU when he was diagnosed as a case of glaucoma.
Tilt table test was not carried out and keeping in view his improvement in blood sugar and heart rate after administration of glucagon his clinical picture of hypoglycemia, confusion, and bradyarrhythmia was recognized to be because of ophthalmic Timolol Maleate which was changed to Travoprost (a prostaglandin F2 analogue) after consulting the ophthalmologist.
The patient was kept under observation in ICU for another 24 hours. His intrinsic heart rate improved to 82 bpm and his TPM wire was removed before transferring to ward. Patient's confusion also improved gradually over the next 3 days and he was discharged on Enalapril, Travoprost, and Metformin. His followup for the next two months was unremarkable.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 46-year-old male visited the emergency department of our hospital on April 23, 2015 due to fever and headache for three days and impaired memory for half a day. The patient had experienced fever three days before, with a peak body temperature of 38.5 °C. No other discomfort was described. He had visited other hospitals before and was diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection based on haematological findings. However, his condition did not improve after treatment with intravenous levofloxacin. Within a half a day, he developed impaired memory, concomitant with speech disturbance, poor response, no significant limb movements and convulsions before being referred to the emergency department of our hospital. The patient had no medical history. No histories of food and drug allergies were obtained. The patient denied any prior history of smoking, heavy drinking or drug abuse. On arrival, the initial physical examination revealed the following: body temperature 38.0 °C, pulse 100 beats/min, respirations 26 breaths/min, blood pressure 144/76 mmHg, delirium, speech disturbance, equal size and round shape of bilateral pupils with diameters of approximately 3.0 mm, sensitive to light reflex, basically normal cranial nerve examination, limb muscle strength Grade V, negative bilateral pathological signs, and no ataxia. The patient’s neck was soft, and there were no signs of meningeal irritation. No significant findings were found on the cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations. No skin rashes or bleeding sites were observed after examining the entire body. The laboratory test results were the following: haematology: white blood cells (WBC), 12.5 × 109/L, neutrophil percentage, 87.6%; C-reactive protein (CRP), 56 mg/L; procalcitonin (PCT), 2.8 ng/mL; and D-dimer, 3.2 μg/mL. A chemistry panel and screens for infectious diseases and cardiac markers were generally normal. No abnormal findings were observed on chest X-ray or electrocardiogram. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed a curved high-density mass at the left sylvian fissure area and an ischemic lesion of the left temporal lobe (Fig. ).
As an emergency diagnosis, massive cerebral infarction (probable atherosclerosis of the left internal carotid artery system) was considered, and intracranial infection could not be excluded; appropriate treatments included aspirin for anti-platelet aggregation, atorvastatin for lipid regulation and plaque stabilization, and cefuroxime and acyclovir for anti-infection.
The patient experienced aggravated unconsciousness after two hours of admission, and physical examination showed the following: lethargy, aphasia, equal size and round shape of bilateral pupils with diameters of approximately 3.0 mm, sensitive to light reflex, shallow right nasolabial folds, immobilization of right limbs upon orbital pressure, movable left limbs, positive right pathological signs and negative left pathological signs. Further revascularization therapy was considered, and the patient was immediately transferred to undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). On the way to the radiology department, the patient experienced further aggravation of unconsciousness and entered a light coma, concomitant with limb seizure, gazing to the left of bilateral eyes, equal size and round shape of bilateral pupils with diameters of approximately 2.0 mm, and disappearance of the light reflex. Appropriate treatments included midazolam for epilepsy, mannitol for dehydration and intracranial hypotension. After termination of the seizure, re-examination of the brain CT showed a curved high-density mass at the left sylvian fissure area and a massive low-density area in the left temporal lobe with many high-density plot areas scattered within it. CT images also showed compressed deformation of the left ventricle and a shift of the brain midline to the right (Fig. ). Considering that the patient developed haemorrhagic transformation, he was admitted to the emergency intensive care unit for further management.
Eighteen hours after admission, the patient experienced further aggravation of unconsciousness and entered a moderate coma, concomitant with high fever (body temperature 39.9 °C), bilateral pupils: left versus right = 5.0 mm versus 3.0 mm, respectively, disappearance of the light reflex, increased muscle tone of the right limbs, and positive pathological signs of bilateral limbs. The brain CT re-examination showed expansion of the bleeding area, with overt signs of brain herniation. The patient underwent emergency left frontal temporal craniotomy, removal of the intracranial hematoma and a decompressed craniotomy performed by neurosurgeons. The intraoperative findings were as follows: dark red appearance of the left temporal brain tissue, concomitant with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH); an ostomy of approximately 0.2 cm was created along the left temporal sulcus; a visible purple blood clot was observed, concomitant with surrounding contused brain tissues; and a large vascular embolization could be observed in the hematoma cavity. Approximately 10 mL of the hematoma and contused brain tissues were removed and sampled for pathological evaluation. Histopathological examination showed haemorrhage, oedema and inflammatory changes in brain tissues, neutrophil infiltration into the vascular walls and surrounding tissues, and microvascular purulent thrombosis (Figs. –). The patient was transferred to the neurologic intensive care unit for further treatment after the operation. During the course of the treatment, negative findings were found for Chlamydia pneumoniae, mycopsslasma, influenza, tuberculosis, the TORCH panel, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); the sputum culture was negative, and the blood culture suggested Staphylococcus aureus. No abnormal findings were found on chest X-ray or ultrasound. In addition, two transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) examinations were normal, and there were no observations of valvular dysfunction or neoplasm. The following final diagnosis was considered: massive cerebral infarction, consistent with haemorrhagic transformation (the left internal carotid artery system, inflammatory thrombus), Staphylococcus aureus sepsis and symptomatic epilepsy. After two months of vancomycin anti-infective treatments and supportive and symptomatic treatment, the consciousness of the patient improved gradually, and several blood cultures were negative. He underwent rehabilitation and was discharged from the hospital on the 72nd postoperative day (POD). At discharge, his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was E4V4M6, and the modified Rankin scale score was 3.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 24-year-old-female patient reported to surgical outdoor with history of constipation, mild vague abdominal pain for 1 week. Menstrual cycle was regular. On examination, the vitals were stable. Central nervous system and cardiorespiratory system examination was normal. Abdomen was soft and non tender on palpation and revealed normal bowel sound on auscultation. Complete blood count and urine examination was normal. The patient had normal report of abdominal ultrasound study which was carried out two days back in private diagnostic center. Contrast-enhanced CT scan of abdomen was performed in our hospital after oral and intravenous contrast administration to the patient for further evaluation. Liver showed three hepatic veins such as right hepatic vein, middle hepatic vein and left hepatic vein draining to inferior venacava (). The hepatic veins are of normal caliber. MPV revealed single IHPV without bifurcation () entering the right lobe of liver, coursing anteriorly in an arch like pattern with decreasing caliber to reach the left lobe of liver and giving rise to segmental branches to both lobes of liver. The MPV caliber was normal and measures about 9 mm in diameter. Thick maximum intensity projection axial and oblique images showed MPV behind pancreatic neck, absence of MPV bifurcation at porta hepatis, single IHPV entering right lobe of liver, giving rise to segmental braches to both lobes of liver (). Both lobes of liver were of normal size. No intrahepatic biliary channel dilation was seen. Abdominal organs, bowel loops, and retroperitoneum were unremarkable in the abdominal CT study.

"A 69-year-old male presented a left thyroid nodule diagnosed on FNA cytology as papillary thyroid carcinoma. During investigations, the patient was found to have multiple bone lytic lesions. Biopsies of the lumbar vertebra and left clavicle showed Langerhans cell histiocytosis. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy with left cervical lymph node dissection. Sectioning of the specimen revealed two lesions in the right thyroid lobe measuring 3.7 X 3.5 X 2.5 cm and 0.7 X 0.7 X 0.5 cm and a single lesion in the left thyroid lobe measuring 1 X 0.7 X 0.7 cm.
Additionally, the left thyroid lobe showed a goitrous nodule measuring 3.7 X 3.5 X 2.5cm. The microscopic examination concluded a multifocal classical papillary carcinoma confined to the thyroid gland with no extra-capsular extension neither lymph node involvement. However, four lymph nodes showed morphologic features of focal involvement by Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Immunohistochemical stains have confirmed these features. The Langerhans cells were positive for CD1a and negative for TTF-1. The thyroid gland was extensively examined without any morphological evidence of Langerhans cell histiocytosis involvement.
Four years later, the patient presented with anemia leukocytosis, and bone marrow biopsy showed marrow involvement by Langerhans cell histiocytosis ().

"We present the case of a 70 year old male who had an elective right inguinal hernia repair. He reported a longstanding history of a right inguinal lump which had been causing increasing discomfort over the previous 12 months. His past medical history included an emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy 5 years prior, as well as atrial fibrillation. On examination, the patient had a mildly tender right inguinoscrotal hernia. Despite being tender, the hernia was reducible and there were no overlying skin changes. Abdominal and testicular examinations were otherwise unremarkable.
Open right inguinal hernia repair was performed using a modified Kugel technique. Intraoperative findings validated clinical examination and a large indirect hernia was reduced. Upon reduction, the hernia sac was found to have multiple 5 mm foreign bodies embedded into the wall. On closer inspection these foreign bodies were macroscopically consistent with gallstones (see , ). The hernia sac and foreign bodies were sent to the pathologist who confirmed the foreign bodies to be cholesterol gallstones.
The immediate post-operative recovery was uneventful and the patient was discharged home the following day. He was reviewed four weeks later in the outpatient surgical clinic where he reported a good recovery.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"This patient, a five-year-old African-American female, fell at school and developed severe left knee pain. Three days after falling, the patient's mother contacted her primary-care physician where she reported her daughter's severe left knee pain that prevented her from walking and had worsened since the initial injury. At this point, the patient's left knee was also warm and erythematous. She and her daughter were referred to her local emergency department where radiographs of the patient's left knee were conducted and were read as unremarkable with no signs of trauma (). The patient was, therefore, diagnosed with a left knee sprain and was treated conservatively with pain control (ice and NSAIDs) and NWB without further intervention.
Eleven days later, the patient was seen by her primary-care physician for her persistent limp and intermittent pain, although her swelling had resolved. Anteroposterior view of the pelvis and bilateral frog lateral radiographs were ordered to rule out any hip pathologies, which could also cause an antalgic gait. All films were read by an attending radiologist and were deemed unremarkable. Relying on these reads, the primary-care physician recommended the patient to continue supportive care (NSAIDs and ice for pain, nonweight bearing for left lower extremity) and to refer to an orthopedist if symptoms persisted.
Despite these treatments, the patient's pain and limp persisted, and the patient then sought a referral to a general pediatric orthopedist for further work-up. Although the child's pain had slightly improved, her limp remained. She described her left knee pain as worse at night but responsive to acetaminophen and ice. She had never felt anything like this before prior to her initial fall. Both the patient and her mother denied fever, weight loss, fatigue, malaise, or recent infection. On physical exam, her left knee did not have a palpable mass, muscle atrophy, or edema, but was tender to palpation. Given concern for the persistent pain and antalgic gait, repeat radiographs of the left knee were also ordered by the orthopedist and showed aggressive poorly defined lytic lesion centered within the left distal femur metadiaphysis extending up proximally 6 cm superiorly from the metaphysis with associated interrupted superior periosteal involvement (). A radiologist reviewed these findings and agreed with the orthopedist that based on these radiographic findings, there was concern for a primary bone malignancy. Arthrocentesis of the left knee was performed to rule out a possible infectious etiology, which was negative. Acute-phase reactants including c-reactive protein, sedimentation rate, and leukocyte count were all within normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and needle biopsy were ordered to establish diagnosis. Contrast-enhanced MRI examination showed a enhancing mass centered in the distal femoral metaphysis approximately 7 cm in craniocaudal dimension with aggressive periosteal involvement (). Needle biopsy of the left distal femur was performed at the site of the lesion, and pathology demonstrated cores of tumor tissue consisting of pleomorphic tumor cells with frequent mitoses, foci of necrosis, regions of chondroblastic differentiation, and rare small foci of malignant osteoid production, consistent with the diagnosis of osteosarcoma. Additional imaging, including chest computerized tomography (CT) and whole body Positron Emission Tomography (PET), was obtained for tumor staging and demonstrated no evidence of distant metastases.
The patient was then referred to an orthopedic surgeon to discuss treatment options including oncologic and operative interventions. Given the concern for pathological fracture and possible subsequent contamination of healthy tissue from this tumor, the patient was placed in a knee immobilizer to limit weight bearing (NWB LLE with walker). The patient and her parents were referred to an oncologist to determine a chemotherapy plan. A typical treatment plan of osteosarcoma involves surgical resection and six cycles of chemotherapy (two cycles preoperatively as neoadjuvant therapy and four cycles postoperatively) with high-dose methotrexate, doxorubicin/dexrazoxane, and cisplatin.
Operative treatments were discussed between the family and the attending orthopaedic surgeon in great detail including potential risks and benefits, and the family chose to proceed with Van Nes Rotationplasty. Radical resection of the left distal femur 17 cm from the joint line with femur/tibia osteoplasty with internal fixation and Van Nes Rotationplasty of the left lower extremity and left sciatic neuroplasty was performed. The procedure lasted around eight hours long without complications. Estimated blood loss was 100 mL or less. The patient was transferred to the PICU for monitoring postoperatively. There were no wound complications postoperatively, and the patient received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and cefepime for antibiotic prophylaxis. Nine days later, the patient was discharged with referrals to physical therapy and the appropriative postoperative wound care instructions.
The patient was treated with chemotherapy for five months postoperatively and responded well. Since finishing chemotherapy treatments, the patient has continued with physical therapy and has been fitted for a lower extremity prosthetic. Postoperative radiographs have demonstrated appropriate healing of the rotationplasty (). Six-month postoperative Positron Emission Tomography (PET) showed no evidence of local or distant metastatic disease. There was minimal uptake in the left lower extremity at the location of the rotationplasty. The procedure with the appropriate adjuvant chemotherapy was deemed successful.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A previously healthy 22-year-old Japanese man without a medical or surgical history presented to Anjo Kosei Hospital with complaints of fever and dyspnea. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 37.8°C and tachycardia. CT scans revealed a 14.4 × 9.8 × 10.0 cm mass in the anterior mediastinum with compression of the heart. Pertinent laboratory values included an AFP level of 31,536 ng/mL and an LDH level of 604 IU/L. His hCG level was within the normal range. Physical examination of the testes showed no neoplastic parenchymal involvement. A needle core biopsy revealed a malignant germ cell tumor, and immunohistochemical staining was positive for AFP. From these data, the patient was finally diagnosed with a yolk sac tumor.
The patient received combination chemotherapy consisting of BEP every 3 weeks for a total of 3 cycles. After that, an additional 2 cycles of EP chemotherapy were administered in order to normalize his serum tumor marker levels. His AFP level decreased to 46 ng/mL after 3 cycles of BEP and further normalized after 2 cycles of EP. After 5 courses of preoperative chemotherapy, resection of the tumor was performed, resulting in a complete pathologic response (). The patient is alive and in CR without any evidence of recurrence.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 50-year-old-male, presented with the complaints of left flank pain of 1 month duration. He denied having any constitutional symptoms, voiding difficulty, ejaculatory disturbances, hematuria or constipation.
Digital rectal examination revealed a mass in the region of left seminal vesicle separate from the prostate. The total leukocyte counts were within the normal limits, serum prostate specific antigen was 0.759 ng/ml and urine culture was sterile. Serum urea and creatinine values were 20 mg/dl (8-23 mg/dL) was 1 mg/dl (0.6-1.2 mg/dL), respectively. Repeat transabdominal and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) [] revealed a well-defined mass lesion, measuring 13.5 cm × 9.9 cm × 5.4 cm in size, posterior to the urinary bladder with homogeneous, hypoechoic echotexture in the region of left seminal vesicle. Prostate was normal in size and echotexture. There was moderate left hydroureteronephrosis with near normal renal parenchymal thickness and echotexture. The distal ureter was disappearing into the mass lesion. Computed tomography (CT) with contrast [Figure and ] revealed a mass with mixed cystic and solid densities in the location of left seminal vesicle. The lesion showed good post-contrast enhancement and no evidence of calcification. The terminal part of the left ureter appeared embedded within the mass lesion. The lesion was seen separate from the prostate and the left seminal vesicle wasn’t distinctly visible on the TRUS and the CT scans. Radiological opinion in view of the well-defined nature, solid-cystic, homogeneous and hypoechoic texture was that of a benign mass lesion. Since TRUS and CT gave adequate anatomical information of the lesion, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was not requested for, though that would have been the next logical step. Cystoscopy showed a trigonal bulge in the left side. Retrograde catheterization was not possible implying obstruction and or distortion of the juxtavesical ureter. Per-rectal fine needle aspiration of the mass yielded only blood and cytology of the same was inconclusive.
The lesion was explored through a lower midline incision on the abdomen. A huge mass lesion was encountered in the retrovesical location, obscuring the left seminal vesicle and involving the left ureter causing proximal dilatation. In the beginning ureter was liberated by meticulous dissection. This was followed by decompression of the tumor by scooping out of myxoid, jelly-like material after a capsulotomy. The capsule was carefully excised throughout taking care to preserve the neurovascular structure at the bladder neck. No separate seminal vesicle was made out at the culmination of tumor excision, suggesting that the former structure is the organ of origin. The right seminal vesicle was normal in appearance.
There were no post-operative complications and patient was discharged on 10th post-operative day. Histopathological examination revealed a benign schwannoma [] with degenerative changes such as foamy macrophages [] and cholesterol clefts [] and characteristic Verocay bodies []. Multiple sections did not reveal any seminal vesicle tissue within the tumor, suggesting that the tumor had completely effaced the organ. Patient was voiding well without incontinence and his erectile and ejaculatory functions are preserved. There has been no recurrence of tumor until date, that is, 2 years and 10 months after surgery.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 35-year-old male reported to Government Dental College, Indore, before 3 years, with a soft, non-tender compressible diffuse swelling involving the left parotid gland for the last 9–10 months. The swelling was noted to have gradually increased in size and was measuring 3.5 cm × 2.5 cm × 4.5 cm at the time of presentation []. It was a well-defined smooth-walled cystic lesion seen in the superficial lobe of the left parotid gland. The patient denied any history of trauma to the parotid area. The overlying skin was normal in color and freely moveable over the mass. The function of facial nerve was normal. There was no associated regional lymphadenopathy or thyroid enlargement. Intraoral examination revealed a free flow of saliva from the left parotid (Stensen's duct) opening.
The preoperative diagnosis of this case remained uncertain as the nature and clinical symptoms resembled the other cystic lesions of the parotid gland such as retention cysts, extravasation cysts, or cystic degenerative salivary gland tumor.
Further investigations were done including orthopantomographic radiograph and lateral skull radiograph however, both revealed normal conditions.
ELISA-based HIV was nonreactive. In addition, the patient did not belong to the HIV high-risk group based on social and family histories Biochemical investigation revealed high protein content A simple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done which showed “A well-defined, thin, smooth-walled cystic lesion within the superficial part of the left parotid gland measuring about 3.7 cm × 2.6 cm × 4.2 cm. The fluid content of the lesion appeared hypertense on T1 as well as T2-weighted imaging (WI), suggestive of high proteinaceous or hemorrhagic content with no solid component. MRI picture was, therefore, indicative of a benign cystic lesion of the left parotid gland with a differential diagnosis of branchial cleft cyst [] Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC): FNA of the mass yielded a chocolate brown, hemorrhagic fluid which on cytological examination revealed sparsely cellular smear consisting of inflammatory infiltrate predominantly with neutrophils, lymphocytes and cystic macrophages against a proteinaceous background suggestive of an infected cyst of the left parotid gland.
Hence, based on clinical presentation, aspiration and MRI, a final diagnosis of infected cyst of the left parotid gland was given.
The finding was explained and the patient agreed for the surgical excision of superficial parotid gland tissue under general anesthesia.
After skin preparation with povidone solution, access to the cyst was made through the lower neck incision at the deepest neck crest which is found to be posteroinferior to the cyst. This helps to minimize the postoperative scarring and avoid from puncturing the cyst. The incision was then extended to the mastoid, posterior and inferior auricles. The incision was then performed layer by layer until it reached the platysma muscle. This muscle was dissected to expose the underneath cyst capsule. Once the plane between cyst capsule and platysma muscle was identified, the blunt dissection was carried out carefully separating the cyst from the sternocleidomastoid muscle posteriorly and the posterior belly of digastric muscle underneath with the preservation of facial nerve. However, the upper part of the cyst was found embedded in the parotid tissue, so part of the superficial lobe of the left parotid gland was excised together with the cyst. The specimen was then sent for histopathological examination (HPE).
Patient recovery was nonincidental with no evidence of facial nerve palsy and wound infection.
The HPE showed a collapsed cyst wall with adjacent salivary gland and small reactive lymphoid tissue. The cyst was lined by thin ciliated columnar epithelium in some areas, cuboidal in other areas and flat squamous cells in still other areas. However, no nuclear atypia was seen. The appearance was that of a Lymphoepithelial cyst (LEC). The lymphoid tissue was of both diffuse and follicular nature [Figures –].","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 43-year-old Mexican Hispanic man arrived in our hospital with a chronic headache. His neurological examination was unremarkable. The imaging workup showed a giant basilar artery aneurysm, dimensions 32 mm × 20 mm (Figure ), and that the lesion was located at an angled portion of the vessel. For the management of this aneurysm, we decided to place a stent at the aneurysm neck in order to: 1) straighten the shape of the parent vessel; 2) promote a shift in the pattern of the inflow into the sac and the outflow from the lesion; and 3) foster the thrombosis of the aneurysm.
The lesion was reached through a left vertebral approach with a 6F guiding catheter (Envoy, Cordis, Miami Lakes, FL). The medical periprocedural management at that time (1997) was empirical, as no rules for anticoagulation or antiplatelet treatment had been defined for intracranial stents. The vascular neurologist advised that the patient be placed under full anticoagulation without any antiplatelet drug. A 3.5 mm × 12 mm balloon-expandable stent (BES) (AVE Medtronic; Advanced Vascular Engineering, Santa Rosa, CA) was advanced and deployed at the neck of the lesion (Figures ).
When trying to retrieve the balloon, the stent slipped backwards and its distal end tilted towards the sac. (Figures ). We therefore decided to carefully slip the stent forward into the aneurysm by inflating the balloon again and pushing the stent distally until the whole of it was floating within the aneurysm (Figures ). A 3.5 mm × 18 mm BES was advanced into the lesion and subsequently deployed within the parent artery to cover the full length of the diseased portion of the vessel, including the aneurysm neck (Figure ) In the immediate post-procedural angiographic runs, we observed a sluggish intra-aneurysmal vortex motion and a correction of the shape of the parent vessel to a 45-degree angle was conducted. The neurological status of the patient was unchanged and he was then discharged to the neurosurgical ward.
A control digital subtraction angiography (DSA) performed four hours later to counter clinical deterioration showed thrombosis of the aneurysm along the basilar artery (Figure ). Rapid recanalization of the vessel was obtained through a mechanical procedure (balloon angioplasty) with the use of antiplatelet treatment (ticlopidine 250 mg and aspirin 100 mg) (Figure ). The patient subsequently recovered and this episode left a pontine stroke as a sequela (Figure ).
At ten years after the operation, the patient has a minor paresis, with a modified Rankin Scale of 2. A new imaging follow-up with DSA and three-dimensional reconstruction has been performed, which showed that the aneurysm remains occluded (no recanalization), the parent vessel is still patent, and no in-stent stenosis is present (Figure to ). The clinical evolution of the patient is described in Table 1.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 63-year-old female presented with a chief complaint of right hip pain. She reported a fall six months previously, which resulted in a displaced femoral neck fracture and was treated surgically with a cemented hemiarthroplasty. She described no relief from this procedure and had pursued relief through other conservative treatments without success. On physical examination, the right leg was substantially shorter, with a distinguishable LLD present. Neurological testing revealed that the index surgery was complicated by a sciatic nerve injury and the patient had a foot drop on the operative side. This had developed into significant heterotopic ossification. Radiographic examination of the pelvis revealed a substantial LLD of 37 mm. Infectious workup on the right hip was negative.
Following consultation with the patient, the preoperative plan included a revision of the hemiarthroplasty and conversion to a right hip THA. During surgery, computer-assisted navigation was again used to assist with component placement and monitoring of changes in leg length. Surgery was successful and the patient did well post-operatively. She reported significant pain relief and was satisfied with the outcome of her surgery. Radiographs revealed equalized leg lengths and implants were well aligned. The patient was able to ambulate by three months post-procedure without any assistive devices. Her foot drop from the index surgery remained stable and improved slightly over the next year. A leg lengthening of 35 mm was confirmed on post-operative radiographs, resulting in a post-operative LLD of 2 mm. At one year the patient was back to her normal functional status prior to her hip fracture (Figure ).","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 60-year-old male presented for an annual skin examination. Physical exam incidentally revealed two large, well-delineated patches on the bilateral forearms comprised of hyperpigmented, hypopigmented, telangiectatic, and slightly atrophic macules (Figures and ). Superficial telangiectasias were also present on the neck and anterior chest. The patient was unsure as to when the forearm lesions first appeared but reported a gradual onset and progressive course over several years. On further questioning he denied any associated symptoms. The patient reported a 25-year history of chronic sun exposure secondary to his profession as a fleet service agent handling aircraft cargo transport outdoors. He denied using any consistent form of photoprotection in the form of sunscreen or physical barriers.
The patient is Fitzpatrick skin type III. Past medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, asthma, and a history of basal cell carcinoma. Current medications include amlodipine/benazepril, which the patient had been taking since his diagnosis of hypertension six years earlier, chlorthalidone, rosuvastatin, metformin, and inhaled mometasone.
Potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation on lesion scrapings, performed to rule out underlying fungal infection, was negative. A punch biopsy was obtained from a representative patch on the forearm. Biopsy of the lesion revealed epidermal atrophy with blunting of the rete ridges. There was increased pigmentation of the basal layer without melanin incontinence. There were prominent superficial blood vessels ().","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 74-year-old woman was admitted because of right ankle pain swelling and gait impairment over the past month. She denied fever, weight loss, or night sweats. Her medical history was otherwise unremarkable. The ankle plain radiography disclosed an osteolytic lesion.
On physical examination, she was in good performance status (PS), and except for a minor swelling of the right ankle, the remaining physical signs were unremarkable. The hemogram was within normal limits, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were 61 mm/h and 7.45 mg/dL (reference range RR; <0-5 mg/dL) respectively. Serum calcium was 13.2 mg/dL (RR; 8.5-10.5 mg/dL) and lactate dehydrogenase was of (LDH) 683 U/L (RR; 230-460 U/L). Plain radiography of the right ankle revealed disruption of fibula’s architectural structure, compatible with an osteolytic lesion ().
Further imaging with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) demonstrated complete distortion of the architecture of distal fibular metaphysis by a pathological tissue that infiltrates the bone cortex and marrow and extends to the surrounding soft tissue. Other findings included multiple lesions, possibly attributed to metastatic neoplastic disease, on the lower half of the right tibia, fibula, talus, and metatarsal bones ().
Bone marrow (BM) biopsy, as well as neck, chest, and abdominal computed tomography, were free of disease.
Moreover, the patient underwent whole-body imaging with positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan that revealed pathological uptake of 18-FDG by the whole skeleton, particularly cranial and long bones (). Many of these lesions’ sites were accompanied by soft tissue masses, particularly in the lower extremities and the maxilla (SUV max: 15). Increased 18-FDG uptake was also noted in the nasal and zygomatic bones, bilaterally (SUV max: 20), as well as in the cervical, iliac and inguinal lymph nodes (SUV max: 5.5) and regionally in BM (findings consistent with infiltrating disease).
The patient underwent a biopsy of the fibula. The histopathological examination showed diffuse infiltration of large-sized cells. Neoplastic cells expressed the B-cell associated antigens CD20, CD79a, PAX5, BCL-6, MUM-1, BCL-2 (80%) [BCL-2(124) Mouse Monoclonal Antibody -Cell Marque], SIg/CIgM(k) and C-MYC (> 40%) [c-MYC(Y69) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody-Roche]. The expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD5, CD23, CD30, CD10, CyclinD1 was negative. Additionally, in situ, hybridization for EBER was negative. The proliferation fraction, as detected by Ki-67 (MIB-1 antigen), was 90%. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) tests did not reveal rearrangement for C-MYC and BCL2 genes. The above histological findings were compatible with the diagnosis of DLBCL not otherwise specified, DLBCL-NOS with no germinal center B-cells (non-GCB) phenotype, and double expression of C-MYC and BCL-2 (, , , ).
Thus, the patient was diagnosed with a multifocal double expressor DE-PLB, stage IVEA according to Ann Arbor classification with International Prognostic Index (IPI) score: 5, age-adjusted IPI score: 3, and NCCN-IPI [International Prognostic Index for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) score: 7 (high risk).
During the hospitalization, the patient experienced a pathological fracture in the lower third of the right femur, which was treated surgically. However, it has aggravated her PS to 4, according to ECOG. Subsequently, the patient received prophylactic local radiotherapy (RT) with a total dose of 36cGy, in the lower third of both legs and was treated with 2 cycles R-CNOP (Rituximab- Cyclophosphamide, Mitoxantrone, Vincristine, and Prednisone). Unfortunately, she experienced septic shock during the neutropenic phase after the 2nd cycle of R-CNOP and succumbed to multiorgan failure.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 70-year-old gentleman presented with a painless swelling in the right thigh for 7 months, which was spontaneous. He had a history of femur shaft fracture, for which open femur nailing was done 10 years ago. Postoperatively, he had uneventful wound healing and fracture union. He has no recollection of any complications following the surgery and was able to walk full-weight-bearing without any aid. Clinically, he had a large diffuse swelling on the anterolateral aspect of the right thigh which was around 10 cm × 8 cm. The swelling was firm, non-tender, and non-pulsatile, with ill-defined margins. The presence of a longitudinal scar along the entire length of the lateral aspect of the thigh was noted, which had healed by primary intention (). The right hip and knee movements were normal. Routine hematological tests were done, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. All the blood reports were normal.
X-rays of the femur were done in anteroposterior and lateral views () which showed an irregular, hypertrophic cortical reaction with the bony remodeling in the proximal femur and an excavated lateral femoral cortex with a broken intramedullary nail in situ.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right thigh was done, which showed a large, well defined, and heterogenous soft-tissue mass on the anterolateral aspect (T1 and T2 images). Post-contrast images showed a heterogeneous and patchy uptake (). These findings were consistent with a soft-tissue tumor. We, however, did not perform a computed tomography (CT) scan for this patient.
After the MRI, we decided to do a closed needle biopsy along the previous surgical scar under local anesthesia in the operating theatre. The biopsy report was inconclusive, demonstrating fibrinous blood material and granulation tissue suggestive of a chronic hematoma.
As the patient was symptomatic, we decided to plan a surgical excision of the lesion. Under epidural anesthesia, in the supine position. The skin incision was taken along the previous scar on the lateral aspect of the thigh. Granulation tissue and fibrosed muscles overlying the mass were carefully separated. We noticed a mass adherent to the lateral aspect of the femur extending intramedullary up to the implant. Using a cautery, we separated the mass from the bone extending up to the intramedullary nail. The excised specimen measured 24 cm in length and 15 cm in breadth. An intraoperative frozen section analysis was done that revealed a chronic inflammatory reaction and no evidence of sarcoma. The defect after excision of the mass was filled with frozen allograft. The excised specimen was solid with a fibrotic wall; on gross examination, after dissecting the specimen, a mop was found ( and ).
The sample was sent for histological study which revealed fibrous strands, clots, hemolyzed pigments of red blood cells inflammatory cells, and multiple fiber strands. The foreign material was studied under polarized light () and confirmed the diagnosis of gossypiboma by demonstrating cotton fibers. The specimen was reported as an accumulation of blood products and their degraded components and not a tumor.
The patient had an uneventful surgical procedure and was mobilized and rehabilitation was started on day 1 postoperatively.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 25-year-old female patient was referred to the Department of Orthodontics, Dental School, Shahed University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. Past medical history revealed a kidney cyst, but the patient did not suffer from any systemic disease. Clinical examinations eliminated the possibilities of any developmental disorders and syndromes. Extra-oral examination did not reveal any abnormality. In intraoral examination, mild spacing in both of dental arches was noted. Her upper left lateral incisor, second premolar and first molar were in dental crossbite without any functional shift. She had class III occlusal relationships and cephalometric evaluation revealed a class III skeletal pattern (). In her panoramic radiograph, four impacted third molars were present (Figure 2). Significant root dilaceration of maxillary lateral incisors and right first premolar was evident. Surprisingly, an impacted supernumerary canine was noted on the right side of the mandible and a primary canine accompanied by two impacted teeth, both resembling a canine, was present on the left side of the mandible. All of the three impacted teeth had fully-developed roots, and showed the configuration, size and root length of a permanent canine (Figures & ). Occlusal radiograph revealed the impacted tooth on the right was lingual and both of impacted teeth on the left were buccal (). According to the patient, there was no history of tooth extraction. The parents did not have supernumerary teeth; the patient had no siblings.
Fixed orthodontic treatment started for the patient. After six months of treatment including leveling and aligning, the right canine and first premolar were not properly aligned because of the impacted supernumerary canine; therefore, surgical removal of the supernumerary tooth was carried out.
Another surgical session was planned for the left side, in which the distal impacted canine was removed after extraction of the ankylosed primary canine, and a bracket was placed on the mesial canine for forced eruption because of its longer root. Both of the extracted teeth had the size and anatomy of a normal canine ().","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 77-year-old female came to the hospital with complaints of lower abdominal pain localized particularly in the left iliac fossa. On initial examination, she was febrile (100.4°F). The abdomen was distended with ill-defined palpable mass in the left lower abdomen. The pelvic examination showed a spontaneous malodorous discharge in the vagina and cervical os. She had leukocytosis (14,500/mm3) and raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (40 mm/h).
She underwent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan which revealed a large collection adjacent to the sigmoid colon. The collection was seen abutting the uterus with air-fluid level within the uterine cavity []. Based on CT findings, possibility of sigmoid diverticular abscess and colouterine fistula was considered. The patient underwent abscess drainage, hysterectomy, and colostomy. About 2 cm defect was noted in the posterior uterine wall communicating with the abscess and sigmoid colon. The patient improved clinically following surgery.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 58-year-old female after allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) presented with cough productive of brown sputum and right shoulder pain. Her symptoms progressed over the course of 2 weeks. She did not have fever, chills, or shortness of breath. She denied chest pain, vomiting, or diarrhea and she did not report headache, loss of consciousness, or seizures.
She was diagnosed with AML 2 years ago for which she underwent allogeneic SCT. Thereafter she developed chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD), which was treated with steroids and mycophenolate mofetil. Her home medications included prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and dapsone.
On examination, she was afebrile with a heart rate of 57, blood pressure of 150/74, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Lung examination revealed reduced air entry and rhonchi over the right upper lung zone. Heart exam revealed regular heart sounds without murmurs and her abdomen was soft without tenderness or organomegaly.
Laboratory tests showed white blood cell count of 7.6 × 109 cells/L (88% neutrophils), hemoglobin of 94 g/L, platelets of 34 × 109 cells/L, and creatinine of 70 μmol/L. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan was done and is shown in . Bronchoalveolar (BAL) stains and cultures were negative for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. Serum as well as BAL galactomannan and serum cryptococcal antigen were negative. Her prednisone dose was reduced and she was discharged home on ertapenem and voriconazole that were given on empirical basis.
The patient's symptoms persisted, so a follow-up chest CT scan was done 2 weeks into treatment (). She was readmitted to the hospital and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics: linezolid, imipenem, amikacin, and liposomal amphotericin B. Her vital signs on admission were stable with an oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Labs were within her baseline. A repeated BAL was performed.
What is your diagnosis?
BAL stains were negative but bacterial cultures grew few branching gram-positive rods that were identified to be N. farcinica. Susceptibility testing was not performed. Liposomal amphotericin B and amikacin were stopped and she continued taking linezolid and imipenem. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) could not be used because she was allergic to sulfa drugs and, unfortunately, sulfa desensitization was not considered. Head CT scan was done and was negative for any brain lesions. Her cough and chest pain worsened and she developed progressive shortness of breath and fevers. Amikacin was added to the regimen without significant improvement in symptoms. She elected to pursue comfort care measures and was discharged to hospice.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"Patient I was a 73-year-old man who experienced right shoulder pain for >2 months without any history of trauma. His pain progressively worsened with a waxing and waning course, despite use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and supportive physical therapy. There was no obvious improvement after injection of intra-articular corticosteroids from another hospital in the previous month. He subsequently experienced limitation of activities of daily living and night pain that worsened over time and made it impossible to sleep at night. Shoulder pain on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was 5 at rest and 7 during motion. There was no history of trauma, known chronic diseases, or alcohol and drug abuse.
On physical examination, the skin over the shoulder joint was normal, and gentle palpation around the shoulder joint did not elicit pain. There was no loss of passive motion of his shoulder joint. However, the empty-can, Neer, and Hawkin's tests were positive. All laboratory results were within normal limits. Plain radiographs revealed a hooked acromion in the supraspinatus outlet view. US revealed marked SASD bursal effusion with a full-thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon (Fig. A). To ensure an accurate diagnosis, he underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that revealed a full-thickness tear along the supraspinatus tendon with SASD bursitis.
Because the symptoms failed to resolve with conservative management, including corticosteroid injection, the authors attempted to aspirate fluid from the SASD bursa to the greatest extent possible (Fig. B). Under US guidance, 8 mL of clear bursal fluid was aspirated, and the specimen was sent for analysis. US-guided intra-articular corticosteroid injection was administered by penetrating the posterior joint capsule. A mixture of 0.5% lidocaine and 40 mg triamcinolone was injected into the shoulder joint space by visualizing the posterior intra-articular space.[ Distension of the joint cavity and SASD bursa after injection was checked to confirm that the procedure was accurate.
Bursal fluid analysis revealed normal white cell counts without crystals. Acid-fast bacillus stain and gram stain were negative. Fluid culture grew no microorganisms.
After aspiration and intra-articular injection, the symptoms abated. One month later, his pain score on VAS decreased from 5 to 2 at rest and from 7 to 3 during motion. Upon recheck 2 months after the combined procedure, patient I was satisfied with the pain relief; therefore, surgical management was not indicated.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 54-year-old male was referred to local hospital with cough and expectoration in April 2018. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass in the left of the lung, with multiple mediastinal lymph node metastases (4L, 5 and 6 region). Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration result was consistent with adenocarcinoma. Staging evaluation in Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (Beijing, China) with CT, positron emission tomography- CT, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain conformed stage IIIB (T3N2M0) according to the UICC 7th edition TNM classification. The patient was given concurrent chemotherapy, consisting of 500 mg/m2 pemetrexed and 75 mg/m2 cisplatin on day 1 every 3 weeks for 2 cycles, and definitive thoracic radiotherapy of volumetric modulated arc therapy (95%PGTV 60.2Gy in 28 fractions. 95%GTV 50.4Gy in 28 fractions). The isodose lines of radiation dose distribution are showed in Figure . A CT scan of the chest indicated a partial response. Grade I esophageal toxicity, Grade II gastrointestinal toxicity, Grade I dermatological toxicity and Grade I myelotoxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0; CTCAE v4.0) were the side effects of the concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
However, 2 months after completing concurrent chemoradiotherapy, he developed progressive disease with enlargement of right inguinal lymph node. Biopsy of the inguinal lymph node was consistent with adenocarcinoma and the patient was administered docetaxel 75 mg/m2 on day 1, carboplatin AUC 5 on day 2 plus bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg on day 1 once every 3 weeks.
Eighteen days after 4 cycles, the patient presented a sudden onset of acute cough after drinking. Esophageal Barium meal revealed a TF. Gastroscopy showed an esophageal mucosa erosion to be 28 to 36 cm from the nostrils, in which a deep hole was observed (Fig. ). Then a jejunal feeding tube was placed for nutrition (Fig. ). Forty days after the placement, the patients suffered from lung infections by an unclosed TF and a covered esophageal stent was placed in the esophagus (Fig. ). The TF was managed with stents.

"We report on a patient who had undergone out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The 61 years old female patient was without any significant previous illness and did not take any medication regularly. The collapse was preceded by malaise and nausea for 10 min. The patient’s partner started cardiopulmonary resuscitation after calling the rescue service. The emergency physician diagnosed ventricular fibrillation (Fig. a), which was defibrillated 6 times in total. After 20 min spontaneous circulation was restored. Immediate transfer to our cardiac catheterization laboratory took place. Coronary artery disease was ruled out invasively (Fig. ). High-sensitivity troponin was repeatedly negative. Pulmonary embolism and subarachnoid hemorrhage were ruled out by means of CT. The 12-lead ECG showed negative T-waves in the inferior leads (Fig. b). Thus, no obvious cause for the ventricular fibrillation could be determined initially.

ECG: Sinus rhythm, HF 60, no AV-Block, no QT time prolongation, inverted T-waves in the inferior leads (III, aVF) (Fig. b). Fast echocardiography: Normal systolic right and left ventricular systolic function, severe mitral regurgitation, no pericardial effusion. Chest x-ray: Normal cardiac size with evidence of pulmonary venous congestion.
Intensive care therapy achieved stabilization of the patient’s general condition. Controlled ventilation was stopped on the fourth day. Except for a hypoactive delirium, which was adequately controlled by administration of a neuroleptikum, no neurological deficits were manifested.
Evaluation of the 12-lead ECG did not reveal any evidence of ECG changes, which are normally associated with canalopathies (Brugada, ARVC, long-, short QT syndromes etc.).
However, we have registered recurrent ventricular salves during monitoring (Fig. c). In addition, we registered a short-lasting atrial fibrillation with spontaneous termination (Fig. d). Therefore, oral anticoagulation was initiated.
Follow-up echocardiography showed a significant mitral valve insufficiency with preserved left ventricular pump function. The left ventricle demonstrated mild endsystolic and enddiastolic dilatation. A severe dilatation of the left atrium (LA area 45 cm2) was noticed (Fig. a). The lateral mitral annular velocities was quantified with Doppler tissue imaging. The peak systolic lateral mitral annulus velocity was 18 cm/s (Fig. b).
Transesophageal echocardiography was performed to evaluate the mitral valve more precisely. A high-grade eccentric mitral valve insufficiency due to a pronounced PML and a mild AML prolapse could be demonstrated (Fig. c). Especially the PML showed thickening and myxomatous changes (Fig. d). The tendinous chordae appeared to be intact.
For further clarification of the arrhythmogenic event, we ordered a CMR. This exploration has shown a discreet mid-wall LGE in the LV inferobasal region (Fig. a). Additionally, LGE of the PM was visible on mid short-axis view (Fig. b). The right ventricle showed no pathology by echocardiography and CMR. A significant mitral annulus disjunction (MAD) measuring 11,2 mm was identified. (Fig. c).
Regarding the severe mitral valvular insufficiency due to the MVP, the case was discussed in the heart team. It was decided to provide the patient with an internal automatic cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) first and to repair the mitral valve by mini invasive surgery in 3 months.
The patient showed regression of the delirium and an increasing mobility. After implantation of an ICD device (Fig. a), the patient was discharged in good general condition and without significant neurological deficits. A cardio-neurological rehabilitation was organized. The first ICD follow-up analysis after 3 Weeks did not show any arrhythmogenic events. At the 3 months ICD follow up, few days after the mitral valve reconstruction, we detected a VT, which has been successfully electrocardioverted (Fig. b).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 96-year-old female body was received through the Saint Louis University Gift of Body Program of the Center for Anatomical Science and Education (CASE) with the signed informed consent from the donor. The CASE gift body program abides by all rules set forth by the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA). Information obtained through the CASE program did not specify a cause of death but did mention a history of Alzheimer's disease, COPD, and atrial fibrillation in this donor. During dissection in 2018, it was observed that the donor was status post hysterectomy and status post ventral hernia repair with mesh.
During routine dissection, a markedly dilated left ureter was noticed and further explored (). The left renal pelvis was located outside of the kidney sitting medially, inferiorly, and slightly posteriorly from the kidney. The path of the ureter curved slightly posteriorly and medially before turning laterally. The ureter then turned sharply medially and anteriorly before continuing over the psoas major muscle. The ureter was most dilated as it passed anteriorly to the left psoas minor muscle, where its diameter measured at 1.70 cm. The ureter then passed posterior to the EIA and anterior to the IIA, about 0.50 cm away from the bifurcation of the AA.
Upon further dissection, it was found that what was initially identified as the left CIA was in fact the left EIA. The donor had three terminal arterial branches off the AA: the right CIA, left IIA, and left EIA. The left IIA branched off the posterior side of the AA. As a result, the median sacral artery was shifted and was observed branching off the right CIA (). After passing beneath the left EIA, the left ureter returned to a normal size (0.45 cm) and position following a normal path to the bladder ().
The three major calyces of the left kidney were found to join together outside of the kidney (). All arteries and veins of the left kidney were normal, and no evidence of hydronephrosis was observed (). Constriction of the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) was noted, though this slight constriction did not result in any gross renal pathology ().
Finally, the subject exhibited extensive surgical sutures, likely from the hysterectomy, along the lateral paravertebral muscles as well as near the left IIA, inferolateral to the ureter.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 54-year-old woman presented to her personal physician and complained the pain on her right breast. She underwent a breast surgery in our hospital. The patient and her family’s medical histories were unremarkable.
The patient was 157 cm tall and weighed 53 kg. Physical examination of the right breast (area C) revealed an elastic hard mass measuring 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm. Margins were distinct, with relatively good mobility and a tumor-nipple distance of 3.2 cm. No axillary or cervical lymph nodes were palpable. Hematological and biochemical blood test results were normal. The levels of tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 15-3, and National Cancer Center-Stomach-439, were within normal limits.
Mammography revealed an indistinct margined hyper dense mass in the right outer portion, which was assessed as Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System category 4C (: MLO view, : CC view). Breast ultrasonography (US) revealed complex cystic lesion, and the tumor was large with 2.5 cm diameter (). Complex cystic lesion on US with blood content on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology revealed malignant cells. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and a T2 weight image revealed an early enhancement image with no intraductal spread (). No distant metastases was identified on computed tomography or bone scan. The tumor stage was T2N0M0. Breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed.
The results exposed two sentinel lymph nodes and no malignant cell. The tumor measured 2.0 cm in diameter and contained a central cystic area (,). Histopathological examination showed low papillary growth in the cystic cavity surface, which was covered by adenocarcinomatous components associated with some squamous metaplasia. Most of the lesions comprising the cyst wall were a mixture of irregular bundles of spindle-shaped tumor cells and fibrous connective tissue proliferation. The tumor was diagnosed as spindle cell ().
Immunostaining of spindle-shaped tumor cells showed positive results for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) and vimentin (,), partially positive results for s-100, and negative results for desmin and α-actin. The final histopathological diagnosis was spindle cell carcinoma. Histological grade from malignancy was grade III. Lymphatic invasion was negative, whereas blood vessel invasion was positive. Lymph node metastasis was negative, and p-stage I was diagnosed. Estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2), which showed negative results by biochemical tests, were called triple negative type in subtype classification. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient received six courses of FEC-100 chemotherapy. Radiotherapy included simultaneous integrated boost enforced 60 Gy (2 Gy/day) to the residual breast tissue. After 24 months of postoperation, no recurrence has been detected.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 43-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for acute postprandial abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, without dyspnea and myasthenia. There was no history of trauma. Physical examination found that trachea shifted to the right, breathing sound over the left lower chest decreased, cardiac border shifted to the right and tenderness in the upper abdomen. A chest X-ray showed that mediastinum and trachea shifted to the right and the left diaphragm lifted. Upper digestive tract radiograph (Fig. ) showed left diaphragm elevated, gastric fundus and body lifted with nearly vertical gastroesophageal angle. A diagnosis of organoaxial gastric volvulus was suspected. On CT scan (Fig. ), an irregular mass was found in the anterior mediastinum, about 6.8 × 9.5 cm, left diaphragm was elevated, stomach, spleen, parts of bowels were lifted. Emergency gastroscopy (Fig. ) demonstrated gastric body volvulus. He was treated with endoscopic de-rotation.
The ultrasound guided biopsy of mediastinal mass was performed for this patient. The pathological findings revealed type B3 thymoma. According to the imaging examination he was diagnosed as Masaoka stage III thymoma. The thymoma of this patient presented with extensive pericardium, aorta arch and its branch infiltration, so it was considered as unresectable disease.
The patient with technically unresectable disease received radiotherapy from December 2013. Gastric volvulus still attacked about once a month, with the incentives of cold, satiety or spicy food. Each time endoscopic de-rotation was needed to relieve the symptoms. In 10 months later, CT scan showed the mass in the anterior mediastinum shrank, but a new small lesion developed on the left pleura. CT-guided biopsy of the pleural mass was performed. The histopathology and immunohistochemistry proved thymoma metastasis. The chemotherapy of carboplatin combined with paclitaxel was given for four cycles. He also received radiotherapy on the pleural mass. Disease was stable for 7 months. Gastric volvulus still occurred with less frequency of about every three to four months, and the symptoms were less severe. The left pleural effusion developed in May 2015. The disease was evaluated as progression. Then he received the chemotherapy of ADOC regimen (cisplatin, doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide) for 2 cycles. Till March 2017, he was still alive with slow progression. The gastric volvulus still occurred every 3–4 months.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 36-year-old Hispanic male with no past medical history presented to the emergency department (ED) with shortness of breath (SOB), initially with exertion and then also at rest. For three days prior to the arrival, the patient reported decreased oral intake and dry cough, but otherwise, the review of systems was negative. On arrival, vital signs were 103/66 mmHg, 120 beats per minute, initially saturating 77% on room air, but improved on 10-L non-rebreather mask.
On examination, he was tall, thin, in acute respiratory distress using accessory muscles to breathe, and with decreased breath sounds throughout all lung fields. Initial labs were remarkable for hyponatremia (128 mEq/L), a corrected anion gap of 13, with arterial blood gas indicative of primary metabolic acidosis with mixed respiratory alkalosis, acute kidney injury (Cr of 1.10 mg/dL), normocytic anemia (Hbg of 11.7 gm/dL, mean corpuscular volume [MCV] of 84 fL), and elevated inflammatory markers (D-dimer of 2.04 mcg/mL FEU, ferritin >1,000 ng/mL, lactate dehydrogenase of 814 units/L, creatinine kinase of 140 unit/L, and C-reactive protein [CRP] of 108 mg/L). Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 110, without ST or T wave abnormalities. Chest x-ray (Figure ) demonstrated hazy pan-lobar infiltrates concerning atypical pneumonia. The patient underwent computerized tomography (CT) angiogram (Figure ) to rule out pulmonary embolism, which revealed extensive interstitial infiltrates with consolidation, especially in the posterior right upper lobe and right lower lobe.
Initial hospital course
Admission labs for respiratory viral panel, influenza, procalcitonin, and COVID PCR were all negative. The patient was treated with convalescent plasma, Remdesevir, Decadron 6 mg IV daily, and vitamin C and zinc supplementation. On day 2, a repeat COVID-19 PCR was negative, and the patient remained dependent on a 4-L nasal cannula. The hyponatremia and tachycardia resolved with adequate oral hydration. Sputum cultures grew Gram-positive cocci in clusters, and the patient was started on Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily, intravenous (IV) Vancomycin 1 gram twice daily, and intravenous Zosyn 3.375 mg thrice daily for broad-spectrum coverage. At this stage, the patient’s imaging and clinical signs were concerning for Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP). The patient reported unprotected receptive same-sex intercourse but denied a history of illicit drug use or transfusions in the past. The patient then revealed that he was diagnosed with HIV seven years ago. HIV was positive, and IV Bactrim 360 mg thrice daily and oral Prednisone 40 mg twice daily were started for PCP treatment. Bactrim was changed to Atovaquone oral 750 mg twice daily because of acute renal failure. Sputum cultures were positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) pneumonia, and ceftriaxone 1 gram IV daily was continued. Azithromycin was initiated for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prophylaxis. It was discontinued when the CD4 count returned as 145/mcL, with a viral load of 5,882,600 copies/mL.
Events following the diagnosis of HIV
By hospital day 4, the patient became more emotionally labile, appeared very anxious, and was tachycardic again. Depression screening was positive; however, the patient refused medical therapy at that time. He remained dependent on a 2-L nasal cannula at rest but became hypoxic (80%) on ambulation. Acid-fast bacilli were negative. Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) was positive. Fluorescent treponemal antibodies (FTAs) were sent, which returned positive. Syphilis was treated with intramuscular (IM) Benzathine Penicillin G. The patient never underwent bronchoscopy as there was enough clinical evidence to suggest PCP. By hospital day 7, a rapid response was called for an unwitnessed fall. The patient was actively hallucinating and agitated, stating that “a car hit me and that’s why I fell.” A CT of the brain without contrast was negative for acute pathology, and he was transferred to the Neurology floor for further monitoring. Overnight, the patient continued to be agitated and was noted to have seizure-like activity in the bed. In the early morning, the patient was still experiencing visual and auditory hallucinations, was combative with house staff, and was requiring four-point restraints and intramuscular medications.
Workup for altered mental status
The main concern at this stage was a Jarisch Herxheimer reaction; however, other differentials at that time included neurosyphilis, metabolic encephalopathy secondary to hyponatremia, toxic encephalopathy from worsening PCP infection versus other viral or bacterial encephalitides, given HIV status. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, showing diffuse atrophy with non-specific enhancements (Figure ). He underwent an electroencephalogram (EEG), which revealed moderate diffuse encephalopathy without active seizures. Thyroid function tests were within normal limits, and a urine drug screen was negative. His transient altered mental status resolved within approximately 12 hours, and the patient was taken off of restraints. He was unable to recall any of the events over the last day and a half. The patient underwent a lumbar puncture (colorless, clear, RBC 91 mm3, WBC 9 mm3, non-xanthochrome, Glu 62 mg/dL, protein 36 mg/dL), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative for toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus, CSF acid-fast bacilli, and CSF fungal culture. Silver stain cytology from an induced sputum culture was significant for bland appearing squamous cells and scattered pulmonary macrophages, without evidence of malignancy or PCP. The remainder of the workup resulted in a positive serum EBV and a positive CSF CMV, with a viral load of 12,400. The working diagnosis was CMV encephalitis in the setting of HIV-AIDS with a CD4 count of 145. The patient was started on IV foscarnet 6,500 mg twice daily and ganciclovir 365 mg twice daily. He completed a 21-day course of steroids with a taper as well as treatment for PCP. He also received IV penicillin G of four million units six times a day for two weeks. He clinically improved with decreasing oxygen requirements and was able to ambulate on room air. The patient was medically optimized for discharge with a plan for outpatient anti-retroviral treatment (Bictegravir 50 mg/Emtricitabine 200 mg/Tenofovir 25 mg) and further monitoring of his HIV-AIDS, suspected neurosyphilis, EBV, and CMV.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 60-year-old Caucasian female with the unknown past medical history presented to the emergency department via her sister for evaluation of altered mental status. The patient was a poor historian, and most of the history was obtained from the patient's sister. As per collateral, the patient had been behaving ""differently"" for the past month. The patient was unaware of why she was in the hospital. She replied, 'does not know' to almost every question. She denied fever, headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness, sensory deficit, gait abnormality, hallucination, homicidal or suicidal ideation. She also denied smoking or any illicit drug use; however, her sister reported the patient has been inhaling heated vapours of heroin for an unknown duration.
On examination, she looked confused and restless, was alert and oriented to person and place but not to time, and intermittently laughing throughout the interview. CNS examination revealed normal strength and sensation in all extremities, including proprioception. No gait abnormalities or nystagmus was observed.
Laboratory investigations done on admission, including complete blood count and metabolic panel, were unremarkable; WBC 8.3 k/ul, Hb 13.3 g/dl, platelets 392 k/ul, creatinine (Cr) 0.7 mg/dl, sodium (Na) 135 mmol/l, potassium (K) 4.8 mmol/l. The urine drug screen was negative. The CT head was unremarkable. MRI brain without contrast showed diffuse symmetric increased intensity signals throughout the white matter (Figures and ). Lumbar puncture was also done, which was unremarkable. EEG revealed mild diffuse slowing with no lateralization.

"We present a 72-year-old right hand dominant Caucasian female transferred from outside hospital status – post sudden onset severe left neck pain and left arm pain. She stated that her neck pain started the night prior and suddenly started radiating into her left shoulder and arm which was associated with progressive weakness. Her pain was made worse by any movement. She denied any preceding trauma. She denies any medical history other than hypertension. Of note, she stated that she does take 325 mg aspirin daily for joint pain. She denies having any known bleeding disorder but stated that she tends to bruise easily. Her coagulation laboratories indicated aspirin therapeutic response causing platelet dysfunction: platelet EPI >300 (normal 72–184) and platelet function aspirin 560 (normal 570–675). Her platelet count was 400 and other laboratory work noncontributory. Her physical examination was significant for having motor deficits as follows: left upper extremity: 4/5 deltoid, 4/5 bicep, 3/5 triceps, 2/5 wrist extension, 2/5 wrist flexion, 4/5 handgrip, and 2/5 interosseous muscles, left lower extremity: 4+/5 hip flexion, 5/5 knee flexion, 5/5 knee extension, 4+/5 dorsiflexion, 5/5 plantar flexion, and 5/5 extensor hallucis longus. She also had sensory deficits in the left upper extremity which displayed decreased sensation to pinprick in a nondermatomal distribution.
Radiographically, MRI of the cervical spine showed an epidural hematoma dorsal to the cord at the C3-T2 levels measuring up to 6 mm thick []. It lied eccentric toward the left with mild-to-moderate compression on the cord. There was no definite cord edema, abnormal enhancement, or major ligamentous injury. MRA of the neck was negative for any abnormal vascularity.
She was taken to surgery within hours of presentation for emergent posterior C3-C7 decompressive laminectomies and evacuation of intra-SEH. There were findings of dorsal purple clotted epidural hematoma that was eccentric to the left. Operatively, there was complete decompression achieved and hematoma was entirely evacuated. Baseline intraoperative neuromonitoring showed decreased motor signals in bilateral upper extremities, left worse than right. The SSEP sensory signals were normal and stable throughout the surgery. After decompression and evacuation, there was identifiable improvement in bilateral upper extremity motor signals on intraoperative neuromonitoring.
Postoperatively, within the first 24 h period, she had near resolution of her weakness with only residual weakness of 4+/5 wrist extension, 4+/5 wrist flexion, 4/5 handgrip, and 4/5 interosseous muscle. She continued to have left upper extremity decreased sensation to pinprick testing in nondermatomal fashion that was stable. She worked with the physical and occupational therapy teams and was subsequently discharged home with outpatient physical therapy and recommendations to discontinue her daily aspirin use. The above case represents SSEH likely resultant from daily aspirin usage.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 17-year-old female patient presented with a subcutaneous swelling on the flexor surface of the lower part of the left arm for last 3 weeks. The swelling was accompanied by mild pain. It was 2 cm × 2 cm, spherical in shape with well-defined margins. The swelling was freely mobile without any signs of acute inflammation. The patient did not reveal any other swelling in the body. Routine hematologic tests showed complete blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate within normal limits. Peripheral smear prepared from the patient's blood did not demonstrate any parasite. Absolute eosinophil count and eosinophil count were within normal limits (absolute eosinophil count 200/mm3, eosinophils 2%).
Clinical diagnosis of neurofibroma/lipoma was made by a treating physician and the patient was referred to the Department of Pathology for FNAC, which was done using a 10 mL syringe and a 22 gauge needle under aseptic precautions yielded pus. Aspirated material was spread on slides, air-dried, and stained with Giemsa stain and Ziehl-Neelsen stain for acid-fast bacilli.
Cytological examination of Giemsa-stained smear showed a large number of microfilaria in the background of degenerated inflammatory cells that comprised of neutrophils, eosinophils, histiocytes, and lymphocytes. The microfilaria had typical features of the presence of hyaline sheath, cephalic space, and tail end devoid of nuclei. Thus, these Wuchereria belonged to the species bancrofti [].
Ziehl-Neelsen staining did not show any acid-fast bacilli.

"A 48-year-old woman with a long history of TNBC (Fig. ) was enrolled in the Phase 1a study of single agent atezolizumab (PCD4989g; NCT01375842) on March 5, 2013. In 1986, she presented with an early right breast cancer negative for the estrogen and progesterone receptors. Initial management included lumpectomy and radiotherapy, and then two chest wall recurrences were treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy (1993). In 2009, the patient presented with another early right TNBC treated with surgery followed by chemotherapy with docetaxel + cyclophosphamide (T + C). She then developed skin nodules and left axillary lymphadenopathy and received palliative capecitabine. In 2010, she developed progressive mTNBC involving the sternum and mediastinal lymph nodes and received 9 cycles of gemcitabine, carboplatin, and iniparib (GCI) until summer 2011. In late 2011, lymph node recurrence was treated with axillary lymph node dissection (2/5 lymph nodes involved with tumor) and radiotherapy. In 2012, she developed progressive disease (PD) and received 3 cycles of a whole cell breast tumor vaccine, trastuzumab, and low dose cyclophosphamide (NCT00971737). Upon progression, she was enrolled in the Phase 1a PCD4989g atezolizumab monotherapy trial, first dosed on March 11, 2013. She had a partial response (PR) by Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) and Immune-related Response Criteria (irRC) after 4 cycles. On May 31, 2013, the patient had an irPR per irRC and unconfirmed PR per RECISTv1.1. In July 2013 she experienced a pseudoprogression: appearance of a new nodal lesion (PD by RECISTv1.1) while still responding according to irRC. She was clinically well and continued treatment. On November 2013, the patient progressed by both RECISTv1.1 and irRC with the appearance of two new nodal lesions. On January, 2014, her target lesions were still in response (Fig. a), while the new nodal lesions were enlarged but stable. On February 2014, after 16 cycles, she discontinued atezolizumab exposure per protocol, with close surveillance.
On March 26, 2014, she was diagnosed with a catheter-related deep vein thrombosis, with left arm edema and enlarged lymph nodes; lymph node biopsy showed scattered tumor cells, while she had an ongoing PR in the target lesions. On July 2014, she developed palpable left axillary lymph nodes with poorly differentiated carcinoma with extensive necrosis (Fig. b). On January 2015 a CT scan showed nodal PD and she re-initiated single agent atezolizumab on February 2015. While on re-treatment with atezolizumab she first had a PR in April 2015, and then a complete response (CR) in June 2016. As of the clinical data cutoff (December 31, 2016), she remained on treatment and in CR (Fig. ). This patient provides a unique opportunity to profile the immunogenomic evolution of the TiME before and during atezolizumab therapy.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 57-year-old male patient was transferred to the emergency department after a road traffic accident. He had a fall from his bike and his right arm was crashed by the following car. On clinical examination, he had pain and obvious deformity in the shoulder while he was unable to move his arm in any direction, especially in external rotation. He had numbness in the regimental badge region of the axillary nerve and normal radial pulse at the wrist. Radiological examination showed an anterior shoulder dislocation with impaction of the humeral head underneath glenoid and associated fracture of the greater tuberosity (Fig. ). He had no other skeletal or visceral injuries. After conscious sedation, an effort for closed reduction (3 attempts) was performed in the emergency room but was unsuccessful. For reasons unrelated to the patient or the disease a CT-scan of the shoulder was not possible to be performed at that time. The patient was transferred immediately to the operative theatre for closed manipulation under general anaesthesia in order to reduce the dislocation and avoid further neurological compromise; a CT-scan and/or MRI has been scheduled for the next morning. Despite prompt sedation and muscle relaxation the shoulder was still unable to interpose. Open reduction was accomplished thereafter using the deltopectoral approach; the biceps tendon was found entrapped posterolateral between the humeral head and the tuberosity fragment preventing once again reduction of the glenohumeral joint. (Fig. ). Tenotomy and tenodesis of the frayed biceps at the level of pectoralis major was performed using a bone anchor; the transverse ligament at the bicipital groove had been torned. Next, the subscapularis was incised, 1 cm medial to its insertion at the lesser tubercle, and retracted medially after separated from the capsule. The latter was incised and the labrum was clearly visualized and was found to be intact inferomedially. Using longitudinal traction and finger manipulation in an anterior direction the humeral head was finally reduced revealing a large triangular Hill-Sachs lesion at its posterior part. The greater tuberosity was fixed back to its bed using heavy transosseous sutures (Fig. ). The capsule and subscapularis tendon were repaired anatomically with sutures and the shoulder joint was found stable through a full range of motion of internal rotation and external rotation with the arm in adduction and at 90° of abduction. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery without neurovascular compromise. Pendulum exercises initiated from the second postoperative day followed by passive assisted forward flexion and limitation of active internal rotation for 4 weeks. At the last follow up, one year postoperatively he had a stable joint, full range of motion and a Constant score of 90 (Fig. ).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 16 days old newborn female from Saudi Arabia was presented to the clinic with a skin defect localized on the scalp since birth. The baby did not suffer from any ailments, and her medical history was unremarkable. Her mother, 32 years old, denied any history of illnesses during her pregnancy, infection or drug intake taking including Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID) or methimazole. She completed 38 weeks of gestation, and delivered her baby via a normal vaginal delivery.
The newborn did not sustain any birth injury and did not suffer from any other abnormalities or feeding difficulties. She did not require any intensive care, and went home from hospital with her mother. Upon local examination, the defect was solitary, localized with an irregular shape and approximately 6×6 cm in size (). The lesion involved the epidermis and the upper dermis only. Neurosurgical team was involved in the care of this patient. A CT Scan of the head was performed, and no deep tissue involvement was noted.
Reconstruction solutions were offered to the parents but they insisted on non-surgical intervention. Therefore, the patient was treated with non-invasive debridement of the lesion and local therapy, including gentle water cleansing and the application of topical antibiotic ointment. 6 months later, the patient has returned for a follow up. Scar tissue has formed over the defect (). Family history revealed that none of her parents had the same condition; however, two of her sisters did, and were diagnosed with cutis aplasia. The elder one is currently 4 years of age, with right unilateral terminal reduction of the first and second toes (). The other sister was born prematurely and died shortly after birth due to cardiac anomalies.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 24-year-old unmarried female patient presented to us with a persistent fistula in the right iliac fossa following an appendicectomy done in another hospital 6 weeks previously. On further questioning, she informed us that she had presented to this hospital with a 2-week history of abdominal pain, confined to the right lower abdomen. She complained of general ill health and occasional altered bowel habits for 6 months prior to this acute episode.
An enquiry with the doctors who had initially seen her revealed that at the time of presentation for acute appendicitis she was quite unwell with fever, tachycardia, and dehydration. Her abdomen was tender all over with guarding, more pronounced over the right lower half. Her white cell count was 24 × 109/L. An X-ray of her abdomen showed a few fluid levels and an ultrasound scan revealed free fluid in the abdomen with an associated right iliac fossa mass.
A diagnosis of pelvic peritonitis secondary to acute appendicitis was made by the physicians, and she was taken up for surgery after adequate resuscitation. The abdomen was approached through a right McBurney's incision. There was pus in the abdomen with an appendicular mass, and the appendix appeared oedematous, thickened, and congested. An appendicectomy was carried out followed by a thorough irrigation of the abdominal cavity. The abdomen was closed after placing a drain, which was removed on the 3rd post-operative day. In spite of antibiotic administration, she developed a wound infection and persistent pyrexia. She was managed conservatively with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medication and eventually improved, except for a persistent purulent discharge from the wound. She then decided to seek our opinion and was admitted under our care for further investigation and management.
The appendicular histopathology was retrieved from the previous hospital and revealed transmural inflammation with granulomas suggestive of Crohn's disease. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen carried out in our hospital showed pericaecal collection with an inflammatory mass in front of the caecum ().
The abdomen was surgically explored through the previous incision after excising the fistula leading into the caecum. An inflammatory mass associated with the caecum was noted. The appendicular stump had not healed, and was draining into a cavity which was communicating with the wound, indicating a complex enterocutaneous fistula. A limited right hemicolectomy was carried out and continuity established with a primary anastomosis of macroscopically-appearing healthy bowel of the ascending colon and terminal ileum. A specimen of the resected caecum revealed the cobblestone appearance of the mucosa, strongly suggesting the possibility of underlying caecal Crohn's disease (). The histology was reported as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consistent with Crohn's disease (). The patient's post-operative recovery was uneventful. She was referred to a gastroenterologist and was being treated with mesasalazine and a regular annual colonoscopy. When last seen at two years post-surgery she continued to remain in good health.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 74-year-old man on rivaroxaban for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation presented with the gradual onset of neck pain. The pain started while he was walking in the woods and was associated with progressive weakness and numbness from the clavicles downward. He was able to walk back to his cabin, but upon arrival he was unable to maintain his balance and fell forward striking his head. He denied any loss of consciousness. He was unable to move for about 45 minutes. Emergency medical services was called and they noted the patient to be completely paralyzed with fecal incontinence. He also had shortness of breath. During his transport to the emergency department (ED) he started to regain strength and feeling in his arms and legs and improvement of his shortness of breath. He denied any recent fevers, upper respiratory infection, rash or tick bites. All other review of systems was negative. Past medical history was significant for hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease.
On initial examination, the patient was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Temperature was 92.0 degrees Fahrenheit tympanic, pulse 56 beats per minute, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, blood pressure 122/56 mmHg, oxygen saturation 100% on four liters nasal cannula. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. Heart was regular rate and rhythm, without any murmurs. Abdomen was soft, non-tender, non-distended with normal bowel sounds. Back had no evidence of trauma or deformity, non-tender to palpation. On extremity exam he had 4/5 strength in all extremities. After 20 minutes in the ED, he developed flaccid paralysis of all extremities with 0/5 strength. His voice also became softer and he developed shortness of breath. After five minutes he was able to wiggle his left toes. Over the next hour he slowly regained strength in his right lower extremity and his voice returned to normal. After another 40 minutes the patient was able to move his right upper and lower extremity and wiggle his toes on his left lower extremity. He was still unable to move his left upper extremity.
A computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed and did not show any evidence of aortic dissection. MRI of the cervical spine showed a prominent epidural hematoma, primarily dorsal, that extended from the foramen magnum down to cervical vertebra C7 and contributed to severe mass effect on the thecal sac (). Findings were the worst at C2–C3, where the hematoma measured 7–8 mm in width with compression of the cervical spinal cord and associated cord signal abnormality. In retrospect, findings were also visible on the preceding CTA. Patient was taken emergently to surgery for evacuation of the hematoma.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"The patient was a 48-year-old woman who met the DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. The onset of schizophrenia occurred in her late twenties, and 10 years previously she had been admitted to a hospital emergency medical center with delusions and hallucinations. She was treated for this previous episode with haloperidol (6 mg), but she had stopped the medication due to EPS. She was admitted to the hospital emergency medical center with a recurrence of psychosis, including delusions and hallucinations. Treatment with blonanserin (8 mg), flunitrazepam (2 mg, at night), and levomepromazine (50 mg) was initiated. At 3 days later, the patient complained of leg restlessness. Her global score on the Barnes Akathisia Scale [] was 3. Substantial relief of akathisia was noted on the next day of fluvoxamine (50 mg) treatment, at which point her global score on the Barnes Akathisia Scale was 0. The dose of blonanserin was increased to 24 mg due to an abnormal experience. Fluvoxamine (50 mg) continued to be administered. After 3 weeks, she was discharged home because she had no recurrence of the akathisia.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"An 82-year-old female patient was admitted to our emergency department because of hematemesis with a high-grade suspicion of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Laboratory analysis revealed decreased hemoglobin (7.6 g/dL) and elevated infection signs (leukocyte count 27 × 109/L, C-reactive protein 15 mg/dL). Initial physical examination was notable for a soft abdomen with diffuse tenderness but without voluntary guarding. Due to beginning septic shock with increasing hemodynamic instability and loss of vigilance, the patient was referred to our intensive care unit. After need for intubation, a gastroscopy was performed. There was no endoscopic evidence for an upper gastrointestinal bleeding. However, endoscopy showed spontaneous penetration of the gallbladder (shown in Fig. ) and revealed plenty gallstones in the duodenal bulb (shown in Fig. ). Subsequent computed tomography confirmed the endoscopic findings demonstrating chronic cholecystitis with pneumobilia and gallbladder penetration in the duodenal bulb with entry of gallstones in the intestine (shown in Fig. ). Further, it revealed a reflective intestinal atony and a dilated stomach filled with contrast medium. Based on the endoscopic and CT scan findings, Bouveret syndrome due to penetration of gallstones in the duodenal bulb was diagnosed. On account of chronic cholecystitis and sepsis, open cholecystectomy and gallstone salvage from the duodenum were performed. Biliary enteric fistula was not found during surgery. Patient could be discharged after several days from the hospital.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 50-year-old man with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) evolved to end-stage renal failure and hemodialysis was started in 1992. Because of voluminous kidneys, a right nephrectomy was performed in 1992, followed by the left one in 1994. In April 1998, a deceased donor kidney transplantation was performed in the right iliac fossa. Induction therapy consisted in seven days of polyclonal anti-T-cell globulin (thymoglobulin), because of delayed graft function. Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine (CsA) and prednisone. Steroids were withdrawn in December 1998. No acute rejection was observed. At one month, the serum creatinine was 130 μmol/L and the glomerular filtration rate was estimated at 61 mL/min/1.73 m2 by MDRD. The serum creatinine remained stable during the followup and was of 113 μmol/L in March 2011.
During the followup in our outpatient clinic, the patient suffered from recurrent episodes of hepatic cyst infections, treated by antibiotics. In April 2007, bloating and abdominal discomfort developed. An abdominal MRI was performed showing a marked hepatomegaly with incomplete chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome, due to extrinsic venous compression by voluminous liver cysts. Because of worsening symptoms and many hepatic cyst infections, a new MRI was performed in June 2008, showing an increasing liver volume without progression of the Budd-Chiari syndrome. The liver volume was 3517 mL at this time. Because of preliminary data suggesting a potential benefit of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors therapy on hepatic cyst growth, CsA was stopped and sirolimus started at 0.5 mg/d to achieve serum levels between 4 and 6 ug/L (). MRIs were performed during the mTOR therapy because of worsening symptoms, and a followup was made with volumetric hepatic MRI. Only total hepatic volume was measured. Six months later, a new MRI showed a continuing increase in liver volume, which was estimated at 3883 mL. In November 2009, the liver volume was 4240 mL and in June 2010, 4400 mL (). The chronic partial Budd-Chiari syndrome did not change.
Under sirolimus therapy, our patient did not report adverse events like cutaneous rash, diarrhea, and aphthous stomatitis, but he developed important legs edema. Hyperlipidemia was controlled with pravastatin and there was no significant proteinuria. Because of the continuing increase in liver volume (i.e., no significant effect of sirolimus) and the important discomfort due to bilateral legs edema, sirolimus was stopped and CsA restarted in June 2010. The differential diagnosis of leg edema was venous compression due to hepatomegaly. After restarting CsA therapy, the leg edema resolved, which was consistent with a sirolimus side effect. Fifteen months after sirolimus was stopped, a new MRI was done. The liver volume was at 4700 mL (). The average hepatic growth over the two years of sirolimus therapy was of 37.5 mL per month versus 20 mL per month with cyclosporine.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 26-year-old female with CF (genotype F508del/F508del), with a baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 21% predicted and a 6-l home oxygen requirement, was undergoing evaluation for bilateral lung transplantation. Her medical history included recurrent respiratory infections with multi-drug resistant pathogens, pancreatic insufficiency, malnutrition requiring percutaneous gastrostomy feeds, atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia status post ablation, and the recent delivery of a healthy baby. She had no history of biliary tract stones, cirrhosis, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C. As part of the lung transplantation workup a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a new peripherally enhancing 6.3 cm mass in the right lobe of her liver, and subsequent MRI suggested intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. At this time, the patient reported feeling a hard mass under her right ribs along with intermittent right upper quadrant pain and fullness, anorexia, weight loss, and daily subjective fevers for several weeks.
Ultrasound-guided biopsy identified the mass as an adenocarcinoma, with positive staining for cytokeratin 7 (CK7), GATA-3, a transcription factor important in the regulation of certain genes, and p40, a marker of squamous differentiation. Notably, the tumor was negative for estrogen receptor (ER), thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), cytokeratin 20 (CK20), and high risk human papillomavirus ribonucleic acid in situ hybridization (HR HPV RNA ISH), and therefore did not support tumor origin of breast or gynecologic, lung, lower gastrointestinal, or cervical or head/neck, respectively. Serum tumor markers demonstrated normal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, but a markedly elevated carbohydrate antigen (CA)19–9 level of 5949.5 U/mL (0–36 U/mL), which can be elevated in pancreatic, gastric, hepatobiliary, and colonic malignancies. Given the tumor location, serum markers, and pathology findings, the tumor was thought to be most consistent with a primary cholangiocarcinoma.
The patient underwent complete staging following hospital discharge, where radiation therapy with curative intent was recommended. Ultimately her poor performance status, chronic pulmonary disease, and risk of severe life-threatening infection influenced the decision not to pursue systemic chemotherapy or surgery as the initial treatment modality. However, prior to starting treatment, she developed pneumonia leading to acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. A second CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (4 weeks from the initial CT) revealed the liver mass had grown to 13.6 × 10 cm and there were patchy pulmonary consolidations concerning for both pneumonia and metastatic disease. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan demonstrated uptake in the lungs bilaterally, mediastinal lymph nodes, right iliac, and right femur, consistent with metastatic disease. Given her critical condition, it was decided she was no longer a candidate for treatment of her cancer. She was transitioned to home hospice where she passed away approximately 10 weeks after the initial CT.
Autopsy revealed a 20 × 17 × 23 cm tan mass in the right lobe of the liver (Fig. a and b), consistent with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (Fig. c), along with metastatic deposits in the heart/epicardium (Fig. d), bilateral lungs (Fig. e), anterior/posterior cul-de-sacs, left ovary, vaginal adventitia, spleen, diaphragm and bone marrow (Fig. f).
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma can resemble adenocarcinomas from other sites, and because there are no histologic markers that can reliably make the distinction, it is often difficult to distinguish them from metastatic tumors []. Due to a lack of a dominant tumor at other possible primary sites at autopsy, and a morphology showing anastomosing glands in a fibrotic stroma with focal squamous differentiation, cholangiocarcinoma was favored in this case.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 68-year-old male presented to the outpatient endoscopy unit for a repeat EUS drainage of a PP.
The patient has a background history of necrotising gallstone pancreatitis that was treated supportively. A subsequent laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. Unfortunately, he developed a PP that required EUS-guided drainage approximately 12 months following his index presentation. A surveillance CT abdomen demonstrated a large recurrence of his PP (approximately 13 cm in largest diameter); thus, a decision for repeat drainage was made. His other comorbidities include chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, hypertension, and a solitary kidney (donor nephrectomy).
A linear echoendoscope was advanced to the second part of the duodenum. External compression of the posterior gastric wall was observed endoscopically. Endosonographically, the PP measured 13 x 10 cm and was punctured using a 19-gauge access needle. Approximately 10 ml of clear fluid was aspirated, and then injected with 20 ml of contrast. A 450-mm Jagwire was passed through the needle into the pseudocyst under fluoroscopy. The access needle was exchanged for a cystotome. A cystpogastrostomy was performed using the cystotome, and a second 450-mm Jagwire was inserted. The cystotome was removed, and two 7 French plastic double pigtail stents were introduced into the PP over the two guidewires under direct fluoroscopy. Both stents appeared to have been positioned satisfactorily, and were draining clear fluid into the stomach (Figure ).
The patient developed severe abdominal pain in the recovery bay. An urgent CT abdomen demonstrated free fluid and gas in the upper abdomen especially anterior to the liver (Figure ). A decision was made to proceed to the operating theatre given concerns for a perforated hollow viscus.
A midline laparotomy was performed. Significant amounts of gastric and pancreatic juices were found throughout the entire peritoneal cavity and evacuated. The gastrocolic ligament was taken down with the harmonic scalpel to allow access to the pancreas. The cystogastrostomy tract and stents were found to have inadvertently entered the peritoneal cavity (Figure ), and thus were removed.
A decision was made to surgically decompress the PP given the high likelihood of recurrence. An anterior longitudinal gastrotomy was performed. There was difficulty locating the PP through the posterior stomach wall as it had collapsed, having spilled its contents into abdominal cavity. The PP cavity was not identifiable despite using an intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS). An 8-French infant feeding tube was inserted through the peritoneal defect caused by the transgastric stent, and placed into the PP cavity. The feeding tube was subsequently injected with saline (Figure ).
A subsequent attempt at transgastric localisation of the PP was successful using IOUS given the re-expansion of the PP. A seeking needle was then used to confirm the location of the PP. A 45-mm Endo-GIA (Medtronic plc, Minneapolis, MN) stapler was used to complete the cystogastrostomy, and the edges oversewn with 3-0 prolene (Figure ). The anterior gastrotomy wound was closed with 3-0 PDS. The PP defect and corresponding gastrotomy defect were closed with 3-0 PDS. A feeding jejunostomy was fashioned. The abdomen was washed with saline and two drains placed: one on the anterior stomach and one on the closed pseudocyst defect.
The patient recovered well postoperatively. A CT contrast swallow was organised on day 10 after the operation, which demonstrated no evidence of any leak. The abdominal drains were removed after drain amylase levels were found to be normal. The patient was initially supported with postpyloric feeds through his feeding jejunostomy, and then slowly transitioned back into a regular diet. He was discharged from hospital two weeks after his operation. He remains free from any recurrence 13 months after his surgery.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"We report the case of a 25-year-old African-American male with OCA2, who was admitted in response to a phone call his mother made to emergency services after making threats to kill himself. The patient was admitted with symptoms of auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions of people stalking him and stealing his thoughts, self-neglect, depression, and suicidal thoughts, which, according to his mother had increased when he became medication noncompliant. He had been hospitalized and discharged one month prior at a different facility, when he had shot himself in the forehead with a BB gun in response to command auditory hallucinations. His mother called 911 when she discovered two BBs lodged in his forehead. He had been released after a two-week stay, but continued to experience command auditory hallucinations to kill himself. His mother again called 911 when he expressed his urges to attempt suicide again. Physical examination revealed the presence of one BB in his forehead, as well as nystagmus and hypopigmentation over his entire body. Social history revealed no smoking or alcohol usage, but a urine test was positive for cannabis. An inquiry into family history was made, and it was noted that the patient has a paternal female cousin with albinism (with no current signs of schizophrenia) and maternal grandmother with schizophrenia. As for his immediate family, there were no other cases of either schizophrenia or albinism among his biological parents or three siblings. According to his mother, he had previously lived a rather normal life (although more on the withdrawn side) and schizophrenic symptoms had only developed a few years prior, when he was around 22 years old.
The patient was started on risperidone, which was uptitrated to 6 mg daily, and escitalopram at 10 mg daily for ongoing depressed mood. This medication combination lessened the intensity of auditory hallucinations significantly, but he remained very depressed and isolative on the inpatient psychiatric ward, and continued to express thoughts of hopelessness. Lithium augmentation was started, and lithium was uptitrated to 900 mg daily. With the addition of lithium, the patient’s neurovegetative symptoms of depression and his sense of hopelessness lessened. He ceased to have thoughts of suicide, and began to interact with treatment staff, as well as psychotherapeutic rehabilitation activities offered on the ward. He also allowed treatment team to consult with ENT (ear, nose, and throat) services to have the BB removed from his forehead. He agreed to engage with intensive wrap-around mental health services, along with ongoing psychosocial rehabilitative treatment offered as part of outpatient mental health treatment. He returned home with his mother after his positive, cognitive, and negative symptoms of schizophrenia lessened to a degree that he no longer expressed any hopelessness or wishes to die.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"Peter and his family arrived to our clinical service when he was 14 months old. Perinatal anamnesis documented full-term birth after cesarean section with adequate extra-uterus adjustment, risk for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and reduced cranial diameters and good general health conditions at discharge from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). At 1 month, the analyses confirmed the significant reduction in brain volume. A diagnostic follow-up at 5 months documented the onset of epileptic seizures. Overall, Peter appeared to be easily dysregulated by moderate-to-high intensity stimulations and poor emotional regulation were reported.
To obtain more specific and fine-grained information on Peter’s emotional regulation during a standardized observational procedure.
During the Play episode, Peter was specifically sensitive to tactile (e.g., mother caressing) and auditory (e.g., mother singing) stimulations. In response to this kind of stimulations, Peter showed positive emotionality (e.g., rhythmic movements of the chest and arms together with wide mouth opening). During the Still-Face episode, Peter immediately appeared alert and sensitive to the suspension of maternal communication by exhibiting an immediate stress response (i.e., increase of motor activity and emergence of disorganized movements of the chest and arms). Interestingly, specific patterns of dyadic matching behaviors emerged including attempts to reach out with the arms directed to the mother’s body while simultaneously seeking eye-contact with her in order to be picked up. Such relational regulatory strategies were something that Peter usually did not show when distressed, as he easily became disorganized.
During the maternal unavailability episode Peter shows a clear ability to regulate his own behavior and emotions through relational strategies, something otherwise non-observable with a different observational procedure. Although such regulatory strategies may not be usual for the infant, it is clinically relevant to highlight that in response to specific relational and environmental adjustments (i.e., face-to-face interaction, lowered stimulation, enough time to organize other-directed attempts to self-regulate) Peter can access to more adaptive strategies to achieve regulation. This knowledge enriches the picture of Peter difficulties in self-stabilization and highlights a dyadic pattern to reinforce in order to support infant’s socio-emotional regulation.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 4-year-old girl was considered as having phenylketonuria (PKU) at the age of 1 month due to her less dark pigmented hair and a positive neonatal screening for Phe.
Her condition was confirmed by detecting homozygous mutation of PAH at nucleotide c.331 in exon 3 (c.331T > C) in the patient and heterozygous in both parents. The genetic sequencing was made in Beijing Kangxu Medical Research Center, Haidian District, Beijing, China. She was a term infant with a birth weight of 2700 g. There was no family history of arthritis or PKU. The baby was given a Phe-restricted diet. L-Amino acid-based medical foods (without Phe) provide ~ 80 % of the protein needs. The proportion of modified low-protein food was adjusted according to the concentration of regularly monitored blood Phe. She presented with normal motor development including walking and running, slight language delay and intellectual disability at 2 years old. At the age of 3.5 years, she presented with pain and swelling of her right ankle, right knee, and right hip joint (see Fig. ). At that time, serum Phe concentration was 22.8 mg/dL. Unresolved ankle pain and elevated serum Phe concentration prompted referral to West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University at the age of 4.5 years. She had severe pain of bilateral ankles, knees, and knuckles. She could not walk or jump. The affected joints were swollen, hot, and painful. A radiograph of the lower limbs showed bone demineralization. Laboratory investigation demonstrated an increase in Phe (19.52 mg/dL reference range: < 1.8 mg/dL), C-reactive protein (33.6 mg/L; reference range: 0-5 mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (36mm/h; reference range: < 21mm/h), tumor necrosis factor alpha (10.9pg/ml; reference range: <8.1pg/ml), and interleukin 6 (41.87pg/ml; reference range: < 5.9pg/ml), and a positive rheumatoid factor. Liver function, renal function, bone marrow biopsy smear and bone marrow culture were normal. Autoantibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anticardiolipin antibody, mycoplasma pneumoniae antibody, HLA-B27, and PPD tests were all negative. She was diagnosed with JIA and treated with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (naproxen), methotrexate and low dose prednisone. Her joint pain responded well to the therapy. The patient has had followed-up appointments every 3 months for 1 year. Now she is thriving and can walk normally, with no further complaint of joint pain.

"In August 2019, a six-year-old male patient manifested right eye (RE) excessive tearing, conjunctival injection and pain. Family history was unremarkable. The child was born after uncomplicated twin pregnancy, in 37th gestational week, but ultrasound assessment was consistent with 34th maturity week. Birth weight was 2100 g and Apgar score 9/10. Photographs before the event depicted isocoria without anterior segment asymmetry.
On examination, RE demonstrated visual acuity of light perception and intraocular pressure (IOP) of 36 mmHg. Left eye showed no abnormalities. The diagnoses of neovascular glaucoma, CRVO and CRAO were established as affirmed with fluorescein angiography (FA). Extensive systemic work-up was performed. Neurological and cardiologic examinations were unremarkable. Laboratory tests for tuberculosis, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma gondii, rubella, herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2, and HIV were negative, as well as factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation, MTHFR gene, anticardiolipin antibodies, and lupus anticoagulant. PHA was not reported in any of the findings. The child’s condition was perceived as idiopathic CRAO and CRVO, which led to the development of neovascular glaucoma. The patient was treated with antiglaucoma drugs topically (dorzolamide + timolol 20 mg/L + 5 mg/L drops b.i.d., latanoprost 50 μg/mL drops q.d., and acetazolamide 250 mg q.d.), panretinal photocoagulation, ranibizumab intravitreally and cyclophotocoagulation.
In December 2019, the child was referred to our Centre for second opinion. Clinical examination showed no light perception. The slit-lamp indirect lateral illumination revealed fully dilated, non-reactive RE pupil (Fig. a). Retroillumination verified blood cells in the HA lumen and anterior vitreous (Fig. b). RE IOP was 38 mmHg. Brückner’s transillumination revealed dim red reflex and tubular remnant of HA freely rotating in the anterior vitreous (Additional file 1). Closed angle and clear lens were depicted using ultrasound biomicroscopy (Fig. c). Extensive subhyaloid and intravitreal haemorrhages obscured visualization of fundus periphery and posterior pole (Fig. d). Thus, RE optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography could not be performed. Ultrasound B-scan affirmed low reflective membranous tubular structure of the persistent hyaloid artery extending freely into the vitreous demonstrating substantial after-movements (Fig. e). It originated within the optic nerve head measuring 4.92 × 1.08 mm (Fig. f).
Vascular occlusion incident was discerned as a consequence of the existence of patent HA in the highly mobile Cloquet’s canal. No therapeutic intervention was currently indicated, but only close follow-up because the patient did not complain of any eye pain.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"This is a 14-year-old boy with an extensive family history of HeFH and a brother with HoFH. The boy has a compound heterozygous for the LDLR mutations c.1846-? 2311+?del and c.1895A>T (variant of unknown significance). The boy presented with xanthomas and hypercholesterolemia at 4.8 years of age. High dose (for age) statins and ezetimibe were started (atorvastatin 20–30 mg/day; ezetimibe 10 mg/day). At the age of 8 years, mild aortic regurgitation was evident. Treatment with plasma exchange (PE) was commenced every 15–20 days. Three years later, the patient required composite graft replacement of the aortic valve, aortic root and ascending aorta, with re-implantation of the coronary arteries (Bentall procedure).
At this point, lomitapide was initiated as add-on to the previous treatment regimen, escalating from 5 to 10 mg/day. LDL-C levels decreased to almost 100 mg/dL (Fig. ). Lomitapide dose was increased to 15 mg/day and then briefly escalated to 20 mg, but the patient experienced elevated transaminases, so the dose was reverted with consequent normalization of LFTs. The LA frequency was altered a number of times in this patient (Q2W–Q6W), and was eventually stopped once the patient was on the 15 mg dose of lomitapide. The response to lomitapide was a 66.4% reduction, and apheresis has been discontinued, apart from two emergency sessions when an insurance issue interrupted the lomitapide dosing (Fig. ).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 39-year-old woman with history of hypercholesterolemia referred asthenia and heaviness in both legs. She had sedentary lifestyle, balanced diet and did not complain intestinal issues.
Her weight was 56 kg, height 170 cm, body mass index 19 kg/m2, waist circumference 73 cm and her blood pressure was tested at a value of 13/10 KPa.
She was born from healthy and non-consanguineous parents and her development was normal. She had not familiarity for early cardiovascular disease, and did not report personal history of hypertension, chronic kidney or liver diseases.
During her life she needed hospitalizations for a miscarriage (28 years old) and a delivery of a healthy male newborn by caesarean section (30 years old). The pedigree of her family is reported in Figure and shows the premature death of one of her brothers for unknown reasons at the age of 1 wk.
The patient’s lipid profile showed a significant elevation of the total (321 mg/dL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (161 mg/dL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (118 mg/dL) cholesterol, whereas triglyceride levels were normal. Serum apolipoprotein-A and -B were 291 mg/dL (n.v. 115 mg/dL-210 mg/dL) and 145 mg/dL (n.v. 55 mg/dL-135 mg/dL) respectively.
Since the patient and her relatives had neither clinical history nor physical signs (xanthoma and xanthelasma) of a genetic hypercholesterolemia, we studied other possible causes of her dyslipidemia through further laboratory tests. Blood count, liver and kidney function, coagulation tests, autoimmunity assays, PCR and urine dipstick were normal. Thyroid function tests displayed a subclinical hypothyroidism. Albumin level, detected by nephelometric method, was critically reduced (0.2 g/dL, n.v. 3.4 g/dL-5 g/dL) and total bilirubin was undetectable. Calcium level was 7.5 mg/dL (n.v. 8.5 mg/dL-10.1 mg/dL), total protein 5.8 g/dL (n.v. 6.4 g/dL-8.2 g/dL), pre-albumin 0.46 g/L (n.v. 0.2 g/L-0.4 g/L). Finally, serum protein electrophoresis (Figure ) showed the presence of a minimal amount of serum albumin (1.6%, n.v.55.8%-66.1%), with a simultaneous increase of the other serum protein fractions (alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2 and gamma), including transferrin (607 mg/dL, n.v. 200 mg/dL-360 mg/dL), alpha 1-antitrypsin (2.56 g/L, n.v. 0.9 g/L-2.0 g/L) and complement C4 (0.46 g/L, n.v. 0.10 g/L-0.40 g/L). Those seemed to compensate the lack of albumin[] .
These findings led us to investigate on the patient’s hypoalbuminemia. Proteinuria was excluded by normal spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio and total protein/creatinine ratio. Other possible secondary causes of hypoalbuminemia, such as inflammatory state and insufficient hepatic synthesis, were ruled out by normal laboratory tests and abdominal ultrasonography. The latter was negative except for mild hepatic steatosis. All the other examined members of the family (her parents, her brother, and her son) showed albumin level close to the upper limit of the normal range, suggesting that they may be heterozygous for a variation in the ALB[] . For the above reasons, we tested the hypothesis of CAA by mutation analysis of the ALB[]. After we obtained informed consent, we collected blood samples from all the available members of the family and two unrelated healthy volunteers as a control, and extracted genomic DNA from whole blood. For a rapid identification of variations in the ALB, we used a gel-based mutation detection strategy, which we developed and applied to the identification of many other cases of CAA[]. Shortly, we PCR amplified the fourteen genomic fragments of the ALB encompassing the fourteen coding exons and their intron-exon junctions, using the specific primer pairs described by Watkins et al[] . The fragments were then examined by heteroduplex and SSCP analysis: The combination of these two techniques usually allowed us to identify the region of ALB containing the molecular defect, which was then submitted to direct DNA sequencing[]. In the present case heteroduplex analysis clearly indicated that the only detectable change in both homozygous and heterozygous samples occurred in the 386 bp long region amplified by using PCR primers A23A and A24A encompassing exon 12 and the intron 11-exon 12 and exon 12-intron 13 junctions (Figure ). All the other members of the family are heterozygous, since they show the presence of four bands corresponding to homoduplex and heteroduplex PCR products (Figure , lanes 2, 2′, 3, 3′, 4, 4’ 5, 5’). The homozygous sample (Figure , lanes 1 and 1′) revealed only one band but with a different mobility when compared with controls (Figure , lanes 6, 7, 6′, and 7′). No variation due to conformation polymorphism could be seen under these electrophoretic conditions (data not shown). The results of the DNA sequence analysis performed on the abnormal fragment showed that our patient is homozygous for a CA deletion near the 3′ end of exon 12, at nucleotide positions c. 1614-1615, according to the Human Genome Variation Society rules, i.e,. starting from the initiator codon (Figure ). The subsequent frame-shift should give rise to a predicted translation product of 516 amino acid residues instead of the 585 found in the mature protein (p.Leu540Phefs*2), in which the sequence Cys(538)-Thr-Leu-Ser has been changed to Cys(538)-Thr-Phe-Stop. Unfortunately, we could not perform a search for this truncated variant in the serum of our patient, but no evidence was found so far for the presence of the putative albumin molecule produced in all the cases of CAA studied at the molecular level[,]. The electropherograms from the parents confirmed that they are both heterozygous for the same mutation (data not shown). This result brought to the molecular diagnosis of CAA in our patient.
Based on the biochemical findings and on the mutation analysis of the ALB the final diagnosis was CAA and hypercholesterolemia, the latter not of genetic origin.
CAA did not require albumin infusions, while hypercholesterolemia was successfully treated with atorvastatin. A low-cholesterol, low-saturated fat diet was prescribed without any significant effect on serum lipid (total cholesterol increased from 321 mg/dL to 334 mg/dL, LDL from 161 mg/dL to 192 mg/dL). Successful and well tolerated treatment with atorvastatin was started at the initial daily dose of 10 mg od, increased to 20 mg od: From baseline total and LDL cholesterol dropped by 23% and 47% respectively, HDL cholesterol increased by 22% while apolipoprotein-B decreased by 25%. Apolipoprotein-A showed no relevant modifications. This observation together with the low blood pressure might explain why, despite the high lipid levels, evident clinical signs of early atherosclerosis have not been observed in the patient[]: No plaques on carotid artery walls where found at ultrasound imaging study.
The patient undergoes clinical and laboratory follow-up twice a year. Atorvastatin treatment appears to be successful and well tolerated and so far she never needed albumin infusions.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A healthy 7-year-old boy was referred from the dental emergency department to the pediatric dentistry department in the Dental School of Casablanca.
Clinical examination revealed that the child has a flexible splint on maxillary teeth and a coronal restoration with a glass ionomer on 11. Radiographic examination showed incomplete root formation of both central incisors (Nolla's stage 8: short root with thin walls) ().
Based on the emergency file, it was found that the boy fell at school three weeks ago. Clinical examination revealed that 11 had a lateral luxation with an uncomplicated crown fracture and 21 had a subluxation. Emergency treatment was carried out on the same day and consisted of reattaching the tooth fragment, repositioning 11 with a gentle digital pressure, and stabilizing it with a flexible splint. One week after trauma, the patient presented with intraoral swelling on 11 revealing necrosis. Consequently, an endodontic treatment was performed and the root canal was instrumented using hand files with gentle irrigation using 0.5% sodium hypochlorite. Calcium hydroxide was placed as intracanal medication. The access cavity was sealed with glass ionomer cement.
For this purpose, the apexification technique using calcium hydroxide has been initiated on 11. The calcium hydroxide was renewed once resorbed. A regular clinical and radiological follow-up was carried out to check the vitality of 21 ().
6 months after the beginning of the treatment of 11, a radiolucent lesion in the periapical region was detected on 21 (). The negative response to the cold test confirms a pulp necrosis. Considering the immaturity of the tooth and the thinness of the root and after obtaining parental consent, the optimal treatment option was revascularization.
An access cavity was made under a dental dam. Once the canal orifice was well cleared, gentle root canal irrigation was performed with 2% sodium hypochlorite followed by irrigation with saline solution. Subsequently, the root canal was dried with large paper points until they were removed without evidence of fluids and filled with calcium hydroxide used as intracanal medication. A temporary restoration using a glass ionomer was placed.
The patient was recalled 4 weeks after the first appointment. The tooth was clinically and radiologically asymptomatic. In the second session, the tooth was anaesthetized, accessed, and irrigated gently with 2% sodium hypochlorite followed by saline solution to remove calcium hydroxide. The bleeding was induced with manual K files introduced into the root canal and placed at 2 mm beyond the working length. Once the blood clot was formed, MTA was placed in the cervical third of the root canal (). The access cavity was sealed with a glass ionomer.
Three months after performing revascularization treatment, visible root edification was observed (). The 6-month follow-up showed an important thickening of the root with calcification of the canal. Concerning 11, a renewal of the calcium hydroxide was carried out once the material has been absorbed ().
After 24 months of apexification treatment on 11, we noticed the formation of an apical barrier which was easily crossable with a file (). To solve that problem, the apical third was sealed using MTA and then the coronal two-third with warm gutta-percha. Concerning 21, the canal was almost completely obliterated with an extension of the root ().","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 25-year-old Nigerian man presented to our emergency department with complaints of tiredness, night sweats, and dizziness on exertion. On clinical examination the patient had facial swelling and venous distension in the neck. Blood pressure was 135/77 mmHg with pulsus paradoxus. Cardiac auscultation was normal. The liver was enlarged. There was no peripheral oedema. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia of 110 beats/min, a vertical axis, QS pattern in V1 and a Q wave in V2 and low voltages in the limb leads. Laboratory testing showed lymphocytosis, increased creatinine (120 mmol/l) and abnormal liver enzymes (total bilirubin 47 μmol/l, aspartate aminotransferase 124 U/l, alanine aminotransferase 200 U/l and γ-glutamyl transferase 268 U/l). On chest X-ray, right pleural effusion and mediastinal widening were seen. With abdominal ultrasound the liver diameter was 17.5 cm, with ascites, pleural and pericardial effusion and hepatopetal flow in the portal vein. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a mass almost completely occupying the right atrium and ventricle with a distended inferior vena cava (Fig. ). The pressure gradient over the tricuspid valve was 25 mmHg (PAP 25 + 15 mmHg). Pericardial effusion was present. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax with contrast injected into the right antecubital vein revealed a mass in the anterior mediastinum with no clear distinction from the surrounding structures. There was a lack of contrast in the innominate and superior caval veins, and contrast filled the right atrium through the inferior caval vein by way of collateral veins. A large right atrial filling defect was found with faint filling of the right ventricle (Fig. ).
Due to the important haemodynamic compromise, the induction of anaesthesia was possible only after initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass with cannulation of femoral vessels under local anaesthesia. A large mass was removed from the right atrium (7 × 5 × 5 cm), but tumour tissue extending into the superior vena cava was only partially removed. Histology was compatible with type B2 thymoma. Moreover, within the tumour, immature T cells were found, with positive CD4, CD8, CD5, TdT and cytoplasmatic CD3 immunostaining. After an uneventful recovery, the patient was referred for palliative chemotherapy with cisplatinum, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide. Six months later, after four cycles of chemotherapy, regression of the residual tumour was seen and additive radiotherapy was planned.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 60-year-old woman presented with one year of worsening throat discomfort, intermittent cough, and dyspnea with exertion. She denied any hemoptysis, otalgia, or odynophagia. She had no other significant past medical or social history including no history of tobacco use.
A CT neck with contrast demonstrated a mass involving the anterolateral right subglottic larynx with extension along the upper cervical trachea ().
In-office flexible nasolaryngoscopy identified a fleshy pink-colored mass in the immediate right subglottis obstructing approximately 50% of the airway. She then underwent microdirect laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy for debulking and biopsy ().
Operative findings were notable for extension of the mass approximately 1 cm below the true vocal fold.
Pathologic analysis noted small B-cells positive for CD19, CD20, and PAX5 and negative for CD5, CD10, and cyclin D21. FISH was negative for the 18q21 MALT1 gene. The combination of these findings confirmed the diagnosis of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type was made.
A staging CT neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis scan was negative for metastatic disease. Following multidisciplinary tumor board review, she was recommended low-dose radiation at 24–30 Gy in 2 Gy daily fractions for approximately 3 weeks contingent upon review of a bone marrow biopsy. Bone marrow biopsy was negative, and radiation treatment was finalized as 30 Gy in 15 fractions over the course of 1 month. Treatment was completed by May 2018. Following radiation treatment, she reported mild dysphagia and dysgeusia which has improved. Her breathing has improved, and she has returned to her normal exercise tolerance. At 21-month follow-up, there was no evidence of disease on exam or imaging; however, she continues to report a mild cough intermittently with no issues with eating, drinking, or breathing.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 36-yr-old woman visited in our infertility clinic, complaining of primary infertility for 1 yr. Her menstrual cycle was irregular, about 60-120 days, body mass index was 27.5 (body weight: 73 kg, height: 163 cm). She had a history of explo-laparotomy due to endometriosis. Neither she nor any other members of her family had diabetes or hypertension. Abdomino-pelvic examination showed the unremarkable findings and transvaginal ultrasonogram showed small uterine myoma, 24-21 mm, normal contour of endometrium, 10 mm, and well defined normal both ovaries. Full infertility work up was performed, results of semen analysis was normal, hormonal study (LH, FSH, Estradiol, Prolactin, TSH, Testosterone, DHEA-S) showed normal findings except high FSH level of 9.66 mIU/mL. The office endometrial aspiration biopsy showed secretory phase and finding of luteal phase defect. Hysterosalpingogram revealed one point filling defect in the uterine cavity and mild dilatation of ampullary portion of Fallopian tubes, but good intraperitoneal spillage (). On laparoscopic examination, peritubal adhesion was detected and adhesiolysis was performed. On hysteroscopic examination, there was a polypoid mass on fundal area and hysteroscopic biopsy and curettage was done. The pathologic evaluation of endometrial tissue revealed well differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma (Grade 1, ) with positive estrogen and progesterone receptors. After curettage, we confirmed that there was no detectable endometrial mass or myometrial invasion or cervical involvement by MRI imaging (). Final diagnosis was primary infertility accompanying endometrial carcinoma, FIGO grade I without myometrial invasion.
After counseling, the patient wished to retain her ability to conceive, so high dose progestin therapy was recommended. Oral megestrol acetate was prescribed 600 mg daily for 8 weeks. On follow-up hysteroscopic examination, she still got a small protruding mass on fundal area. We performed hysteroscopic biopsy and endometrial curettage. The pathologic evaluation of endometrium revealed complex hyperplasia without cellular atypia (). She continued to receive megestrol acetate but complained intolerable weight gain from 73 to 88 kg. We decided to reduce the dose to 400 mg, daily for 4 weeks, then 320 mg, daily for 12 weeks. After megestrol medication of total 71,680 mg during 24 weeks, we found smooth atrophic endometrium by hysteroscopic examination, and this was confirmed as atrophic endometrium through the histological examination of tissue obtained by curettage. Then we decided to perform IVF program in order to optimize the patient's potential for fertility and achieve a viable pregnancy without further delay.
After pituitary down-regulation by the GnRHa (Buserelin acetate, Superfact®, Hoechst), follicle-stimulating hormone preparation (Follimon®, LGIC, Korea) was administrated, 375 IU daily for 12 days. The follicular growth was monitored from gonadotropin day 5 by 3 days interval and human chorionic gonadotropin (IVF-C®, LGIC, Korea) 10,000 IU was administrated when the at least 3 or more follicles reached 18 mm in diameter. And 35 hr later, oocytes aspiration was performed under the guidance of transvaginal ultrasonography. Two mature oocytes were retrieved and inseminated with her husband's prepared spermatozoa. Fifty seven hours after oocyte retrieval, the two high grade 4-cell embryos were transferred. Measurement of β-hCG revealed 3,449 mIU/mL on 19 days after embryo transfer, and on 23 days after embryo transfer, intrauterine single gestational sac with yolk sac and right tubal pregnancy were identified by transvaginal ultrasonogram. Right salpingectomy was performed under the epidural anesthesia, on 27 days after embryo transfer, we could detect the fetal pole with heart beat in the intrauterine gestational sac after that procedure. Then she received routine obstetrical care and delivered by Cesarean section at 38 weeks in gestational periods. The baby was female, 2,590 g, and the Apgar score was 8 at 1 min, 9 at 5 min. Placenta was grossly and microscopically normal, there was no evidence of residual tumor in the uterus and adnexa or abdominal organ.
Twelve weeks after delivery, endometrial thickness measured by transvaginal ultrasonography was 4 mm and endometrial biopsy revealed no evidence of recurrent disease. Two years after delivery, she was healthy without any evidence of recurrent disease.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 50-year-old female was referred to us as a case of primary acute angle closure attack in the right eye and for laser PI. She had redness, watering, and severe ocular pain in her right eye (RE) for 1 day. The visual acuity was 6/18 in the right eye (RE) and 6/6 in the left eye (LE). LE had a deep anterior chamber (AC) and a normal fundus. Slit lamp examination of RE revealed conjunctival chemosis, circumcorneal congestion, shallow AC, and no AC cells (Figure 1a,b ). Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 38 mmHg in RE and 12 mmHg in LE by applanation. A diagnosis of acute primary ACG due to pupillary block mechanism in RE was considered. However, additional findings included swelling of the upper eyelid, scleral tenderness, clear cornea, reactive round pupil, fine choroidal folds (Figure 1e ), shallow peripheral annular choroidal detachment, and limitation of ocular movement with pain in RE. She had a history of such an episode three years back. Due to these factors, a suspicion of scleritis with secondary ACG was also kept as a differential diagnosis. An ultrasonogram (USG) B-scan of RE showed fluid accumulation in the subtenon space with thickening of the ocular coats (Figure 1c ). Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) revealed thickening of the sclera and supraciliary effusion along with some anterior rotation of the ciliary body (Figure 1d ). Fundus fluorescein angiography made the choroidal folds obvious (Figure 1f ). She was diagnosed to have diffuse anterior scleritis and posterior scleritis (panscleritis) with secondary ciliochoroidal effusion and ACG in RE. She was started on topical atropine sulfate drop 1% thrice a day, brimonidine tartrate drop 0.15% twice a day, prednisolone acetate 1% 4 times a day in RE, tablet acetazolamide 250 mg twice daily, and intravenous methylprednisolone 1 mg once daily for three consecutive days. At day two, there was an improvement in lid swelling, ocular pain, ocular motility, conjunctival chemosis, and congestion, and the vision improved to 6/9 in RE. The anterior chamber deepened and the IOP was 8 mmHg in RE. Oral acetazolamide were stopped. After three days of pulse steroid, she was shifted to oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day and atropine/prednisolone drops were continued. At 1 week, the UBM showed resolved ciliary effusion. She was negative for antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (P-ANCA, and C-ANCA), anti-citrullinated cyclopeptide (anti-CCP), and VDRL (venereal disease research laboratory). Angiotensin converting enzyme, chest X-ray, and Mantoux were unremarkable. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 28 (normal 0–20) mm in the first hour, and C-reactive protein was 21 (normal <10) mg/L. There was no history of tick bite or herpes zoster ophthalmicus. The oral and topical steroid was tapered and atropine/antiglaucoma drops were stopped. At 1 month, her best-corrected visual acuity was 6/6 in either eye, the eyes were quiet, and the choroidal folds in the right eye had disappeared (Figure 2a ). The eye remained stable till the last follow-up at 8 months, and the anterior chamber remained deep (Figure 2b ).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 55-year-old woman reported a 24-hour history of unusual pain in her left carotid area irradiating to the ear. Colour Doppler ultrasound revealed an eccentric hypoechoic thickening (black arrows on Figure ) of the proximal bulbar internal carotid but also partially of the carotid bifurcation itself. A thin hyperechoic atheromatous fibrous plaque was also visible (small white arrows on Figure ) but no significant stenosis was found. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound showed normal capillary distribution of micro bubbles in the hypo echoic thickening, therefore excluding haematoma (Figure , black arrows). The avascular fibrous plaque was well demonstrated (small black arrows). Unenhanced Axial T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging showed an hypo intense tissue (Figure , black arrows) around the proximal internal carotid. Intense enhancement of this tissue was shown on fat-saturated contrast enhanced T1-weighted images (Figure ). Carotidynia or TIPIC syndrome was diagnosed and the woman was immediately treated with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs.

"A 27-year-old man complained of 2-month history of nasal stuffiness, epistaxis and maxillary sinus pain. One month later, he developed painful swellings over the outer part of both eyes. He was diagnosed elsewhere as presumed lid abscess and managed with antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) and drainage of purulent material from these swellings. He presented to us after another month with recurrence of eye swelling along with new development of dry cough. There was no history of redness of eyes, blurring of vision, diplopia, dry eyes, hemoptysis, dyspnea, fever, oliguria, hematuria, skin rash, tingling, burning or weakness in extremities, headache, seizures or altered sensorium. Examination revealed bilateral S-shaped swelling diagnosed as lacrimal gland swelling [] by our ophthalmologist. There was bilateral ptosis but no ophthalmoplegia or Horner’s syndrome. There was no uveitis or retinal involvement. The patient was normotensive and systemic examination was unremarkable. Investigations revealed polymorphonuclear leukocytosis and thrombocytosis. Complement proteins C3, C4 and renal functions were normal. Urine examination revealed active sediments [white blood cells (WBC) 20-25/high power field (HPF), red blood cells (RBC) 6-8/HPF], but no albuminuria. Chest radiography and computerized tomography (CT) scan showed nodular and cavitating lesions [Fig. , ]. CT orbit did not reveal any retro-orbital mass. Culture of pus from past incisions over lacrimal gland did not reveal any organism. Incisional biopsy done from lateral aspect of left lacrimal gland swelling showed fibro-areolar tissue with necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis[]. Positive cytoplasmic-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (c-ANCA) and high serine proteinase-3 levels (366 U/ml; normal <16 U/ml) confirmed the diagnosis of WG. The patient was treated with initial regimen of daily oral cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg) and oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg) which was gradually tapered after initial remission was obtained.
A month later, there was complete regression of lacrimal gland swelling, but left-sided ptosis [] continued to persist. He also developed marked dryness of eyes and Schirmer’s I test was positive (2 mm wetting in both the eyes after 5 minutes). There was no dry mouth, diplopia or ophthalmoplegia. Antinuclear, anti Ro and anti La antibodies were negative. There was complete regression of lung cavities with the above treatment after 3 months.

"A 69-year-old female (patient 1 in ) developed a gait disturbance 6 months before admission and suffered from the gradual progression of weakness in her extremities. On admission, neurological examination showed proximal muscle weakness and reduced deep tendon reflex. Routine laboratory test results were unremarkable. Antinuclear antibodies, anti-acetylcholine (ACh) receptor antibody, and anti-voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibodies were negative. The results of chest and abdominal CT were unremarkable. In a nerve conduction study, CMAPs had slightly low amplitudes, and nerve conduction velocities were normal in the median and ulnar nerves. Needle EMG showed early recruitment and polyphasic MUPs with short durations and low amplitudes, suggesting the diagnosis of myopathy. Interestingly, the myopathic EMG findings were improved after sustained strong muscle contraction for 10 s; the MUP sizes returned to normal after a sustained strong muscle contraction, and the early recruitment of MUPs in the weak contraction was clearly normalized in the biceps brachii muscle (). Thereafter, we performed an RNS test because she complained of easy fatigability. The RNS test showed an obvious incremental response of the CMAP amplitude of the abductor digiti minimi muscle after high-rate stimulation of the ulnar nerve, indicating the diagnosis of LEMS [–].

"A 60-year-old male retired soldier presented with a 4-month history of recurrent low-grade fever, cough, abdominal distention and remarkable weight loss. He was chronically ill looking, wasted, moderately pale, splenomegaly of 16 cm, and hepatomegaly of 6 cm. Haematological investigation showed packed cell volume (PCV) of 21.7% (37.0-53.0%), total white blood cell (WBC) count of 30.5 × 109/L (3.0-13.2 × 109/L) with differentials of granulocyte of 36.3%, lymphocyte 53.6%, medium sized (MID) 10.1%. Platelet count was 324 × 109/L. Other investigations revealed erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) ˃80 mm in the first hour. Chest radiograph (hilar opacities), mantoux test (negative) and sputum acid bacilli (negative). The patient was then classified as smear-negative tuberculosis. He was then placed on empirical anti tuberculosis therapy according to the Nigerian national guideline for tuberculosis therapy. However, there was no clinical response after 4 weeks.
On haematological review he was found to be emaciated, mildly pale, mildly dehydrated without significant peripheral lymphadenopathy. The chest was clinically clear, and the cardio-vascular system was stable. He has an enlarged spleen measuring 24 cm below the left coastal margin. Repeat haematological investigations revealed a PCV of 20.8%, WBC count of 48.8 × 109/L differentials were neutrophils 70%, lymphocyte 8%, monocyte 4%, band forms 2%, metamyelocyte 10% and myelocyte 6%. The platelet count was 769 × 109/L. The peripheral blood film showed 416 nucleated red blood cells (NRBC) per 100 WBC, macrothrombocyte, leuco-erythroblastosis, tear drop poikilocytes, target cells, fragment cells and hypogranular granulocyte with bizarre segmentation. Bone marrow aspiration (BMA) revealed myeloid:Erythroid reversal and increased megakaryocytopoiesis. Biopsy findings were consistent with increase dysplastic megakaryocyte and moderate fibrosis.
These laboratory and clinical findings led to a diagnosis of CML (accelerated phase) to rule out cellular phase of myelofibrosis (MF); thus, cytoreductive therapy was started with hydroxyurea (HU) for 3 months while awaiting results of molecular biologic test. The test turned out positive for BCR-ABL1 (e14a2/e13a2) 61.6%. The patient was then commenced on Imatinib at 400 mg once daily. However, response to Imatinib was sub-optimal; thus, JAK2 analysis was requested on the same sample, and it turned out to be positive for the JAK2 mutation (exon14V617F). He was then maintained on Imatinib, blood transfusion support, erythropoietin and regular follow-up, but the patient died in a peripheral hospital about 10 months after diagnosis.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 42-year-old male, presented with a complaint of numbness over the left foot for 5–6 months. On examination, the power of the left ankle was 3/5, left extensor hallucis longus was 3/5, and 50% loss of sensation of touch, pain, and temperature at L3–L5 dermatome. Sphincter involvement was absent. History of previous spine surgery or lumbar puncture was absent. MRI spine revealed intramedullary lesion in the conus at D12–L1. Lesion was hyperintense with areas of isointense on T1-weighted image and heterogenous on T2 weighted image []. The patient was operated with D12–L1 laminectomy. The dura was opened in the midline and intramedullary cystic lesion was found at the conus. Posterior midline myelotomy was performed followed by evacuation of yellowish pultaceous material. The cyst wall was firmly adhered to the neural tissue of conus medullaris and could not be excised to prevent injury to neural tissue. The cyst was evacuated and the epithelial lining of the cyst wall was electrocoagulated although not extensively to prevent any new deficit, based on previous experience. On histopathology, the cyst was lined by stratified squamous epithelium and underlying fibro collagenous tissue showed hemorrhage and lymphomononuclear infiltrate []. All these features were characteristic of intramedullary white EC. Immediately after the surgery, the patient recovered completely with no new deficit. On 5 months, follow-up patient developed numbness with recurrence of the cyst at the same site. The patient was advised to repeat surgery, which he refused.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 61-year-old woman was referred by another institution with a diagnosis of distal transverse colon invasive adenocarcinoma and resectable liver metastases. Her past medical history revealed type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. No relevant family history was noted. The case was discussed at the multidisciplinary tumor board meeting, and the decision was taken for the patient to undergo surgery for the primary tumor and subsequently address the treatment of liver metastases. A laparoscopic-assisted transverse colectomy with primary anastomosis was performed with no intraoperative complications. On the fourth postoperative day, she developed tachypnea, fever, and leukocytosis. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen with contrast was carried out. This showed a right middle lobe opacification consistent with pneumonia. A small <5 cm localized pelvic collection was noted; otherwise, the intra-abdominal organs including the spleen were unremarkable (). Blood cultures were negative. Conservative treatment with intravenous ciprofloxacin was initiated. Her condition slowly improved. However, three days later, she developed severe metabolic acidosis due to acute renal failure. She was shifted to the ICU and underwent urgent hemodialysis. Four days after starting hemodialysis, she complained of acute left upper abdominal pain and developed hypovolemic shock.
Laboratory investigations showed normochromic normocytic anemia (hemoglobin 8.7 g/dL (12-17), white cell count 20.8 × 109/L (4-11), platelet count 517 × 109/L (150-400), blood urea nitrogen 12.9 mmol/L (2.7-7.2), and creatinine 342 μmol/L (53-97)). Liver function tests showed an albumin of 14 g/L (34-50), alkaline phosphatase of 225 μ/L (54-144), prothrombin time of 16.1 (9.6-12.6), partial thromboplastin time of 36 sec. (24.3-30.2), and international normalized ratio of 1.5 (0.8-1.2).
Blood gases revealed a pH of 7.15 (7.3-7.4), pCO2 of 27 mmHg (36-46), HCO3 of 18.5 mmol/L (21-28), lactate of 1.5 mmol/L (0.5-1), and anion gap of 24.2.
A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a large subcapsular splenic hematoma with gas formation. There was no evidence of bowel perforation or obstruction ().
An emergency laparotomy was performed, and this showed a ruptured splenic hematoma. Peritoneal lavage and splenectomy were performed. Histology showed a necrotic spleen with fibrin and focal fat necrosis with no evidence of malignancy.
The patient made a slow but uneventful recovery and was eventually transferred to the nephrology unit to continue treatment for renal failure.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 10-year-old girl presented with high-grade intermittent fever with cough for 20 days and a generalized rash for 15 days following ingestion of phenobarbital for 6 weeks. There was h/o seizures with fever from the age of 18 months, but the severity and frequency of seizures started increasing, occurring even without fever for which she was put on oral phenobarbital.
On admission, we found that the girl was toxic, febrile, icteric, with tachypnea, tachycardia, conjunctival congestion, stomatitis, and cervical, axillary and inguinal lymph node enlargement. There was a diffuse erythematous, maculopapular rash without vesiculation or blistering []. There were bilateral diffuse crepitations over the chest and tender hepatomegaly.
Initial investigations showed leukocytosis, eosinophilia (absolute eosinophil count: 1586/dl), high bilirubin, elevated liver enzymes, microscopic hematuria and minimal pyuria. Imaging studies revealed hepatomegaly with features of hepatitis, mild pericardial effusion on echocardiography, and features of diffuse pneumonitis. Initial blood culture and urine culture were negative.
The patient was put on empirical antibiotics and other supportive measures. Antibiotics were changed and steroid (i.v. dexamethasone) was added on persistence of fever and dyspnea, following which there was a short period of improvement. But after a few days, the girl again complained of sudden onset exacerbation of respiratory distress and we found that she had developed subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum []. The patient had intermittent high spiking fever. A repeat blood culture showed growth of Acinetobacter baumanii and we switched over to sensitive antibiotics. But the general condition deteriorated and the patient developed ARDS for which she was ventilated. She improved dramatically and was extubated after 6 days. The girl again developed fever and dyspnea 2 days postextubation. There were findings of ARDS and pneumothorax on chest X-ray. She was ventilated again but succumbed after 5 days.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 19-year-old female with no significant past medical history was referred to the emergency department from her antenatal clinic for further evaluation of fever 102 F, headache, malaise, nausea, and vomiting of 4-days duration following mild sore throat. She was in her 28th week of gestation on presentation. Physical examination showed an obese and anxious-appearing lady in mild respiratory distress with gravid abdomen. She weighed 142 kilograms (kg) with a BMI of 44.3. Her blood pressure was 111/60 mmHg, respiratory rate 24, heart rate 111, temperature 101.8 F, and oxygen saturation 96% on 2 liters (L) nasal cannula oxygen. She had dry mucous membranes, with no oral thrush or ulcers. Her abdomen was gravid with focal areas of tenderness, bowel sounds were heard, and fetal movement was detected. Pulmonary and cardiovascular examinations were unremarkable.
Her initial laboratory tests were significant for white blood cell (WBC) count of 11.8 K/uL with 78% neutrophil predominance and lymphopenia (0.77 K/uL). Although she had no urinary symptoms, urinalysis showed bacteriuria, confirmed as group B streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) with cultures. Initial chest X-ray and liver enzymes on admission were unremarkable. She was started on intravenous fluids for suspected gastroenteritis and oral cephalexin for asymptomatic GBS infection. Stool studies for clostridium difficile, comprehensive panel, ova, and parasites were ordered which all returned negative. However, she continued to spike fever through the third day of hospitalization prompting expansion of antibiotic coverage to Vancomycin and Zosyn (). Liver transaminases which had been normal began to spike. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 190, alanine aminotransferase (AST) was 135, and alkaline phosphatase was 110 while bilirubin remained normal. Serum Tylenol and hepatitis A, B, and C serologies were negative. Infectious Disease (ID) consultation was requested who recommended further infectious work-up with CMV, EBV, HIV, HSV, Rickettsia, and Leptospira serologies.
The patient continued to spike high grade fever reaching 103 F on day 4 of admission despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics and negative infectious work-up including the aforementioned serologies. She also developed bloody diarrhea and acute kidney injury (AKI) prompting evaluation for possible Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and autoimmune diseases which all returned negative as well. Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed normal liver and gallbladder morphologies. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed diffuse T2 hyperintensity throughout the liver compatible with acute liver injury but was negative for any focal intra-abdominal or pelvic abscess.
One week into her hospitalization, her AST and ALT kept trending up reaching a peak of 1712 U/L and 845 U/L, respectively (), mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase 140, INR 1.6, normal total bilirubin, absolute lymphocyte count of 0.11 K/uL, persistently negative blood cultures, and serum creatinine increased to 2.9 mg/dL, all concerning for a disseminated process. She became increasingly lethargic, tachycardic, and tachypneic necessitating care in the intensive care unit. With uprising liver enzymes and negative extensive infectious and rheumatologic work-up including Hep A, B, C serologies and PCR, EBV, CMV, Parvovirus, Rickettsia, and Leptospiral serologies, as well as negative HSV 1 and 2 IgM and IgG antibodies, antinuclear, and anti-liver-kidney microsomal antibodies, normal cryoglobulins, ceruloplasmin, alpha 1 antitrypsin and serum copper levels, and largely unremarkable imaging and stool studies, a decision was made to proceed with a liver biopsy. At this time, empiric acyclovir was started while other antibiotics were discontinued per ID recommendations.
Within the first 24 hours of starting acyclovir, AST and ALT began to downtrend while fever and diarrhea improved (). Despite negative HSV-2 serologies, the PCR was reported on hospital day-8 with a very high viral load >100 million DNA copies/ml following which she reported a remote history of cold sores but denied a history of genital ulcers. A diagnosis of HSV hepatitis was made and she was transitioned to Val-acyclovir 1 gram three times daily to complete 14 days of therapy, then to resume acyclovir 400 mg three times daily until delivery to prevent recurrence. On the 12th day of hospitalization, she was discharged home without needing a biopsy anymore and with complete resolution of symptoms and improvement of liver enzymes and AKI; AST 72, ALT 208, alkaline phosphatase 150, total bilirubin 0.5 and creatinine 0.5. She remained symptom-free with complete normalization of creatinine and liver enzymes at outpatient follow-up two weeks after discharge. She was eventually delivered of a healthy baby boy via cesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation with no peripartum complications.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 28-year-old male patient presented with persistent scrotal erythema and inguinal striae of 6 months duration. He had a previous diagnosis of onychomycosis and tinea cruris treated with itraconazole. He had employed a topical combination cream of betamethasone, gentamicin, and clotrimazole for 14 months in the inguinal region with suspension 6 months before evaluation. He referred erythema, warmth, and dysesthesia. On examination, the patient had scrotal involvement and atrophic inguinal striae. The patient was treated with pregabalin 150 mg at night for 3 months with complete remission.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 73-year-old right-handed AA woman with a known history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease presented to the UAB emergency room with shortness of breath, lower extremity edema, and confusion. There was no travel history, and contact exposure to COVID-19 was unknown. A significant past neurological history included surgical repair of left frontal skull base ethmoidal encephalocele and ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus. At presentation, she had an axillary temperature of 90.6 F, heart rate of 44 beats per minute, blood pressure of 86/71 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. There was no focal neurological weakness or neck stiffness, but she had diminished level of consciousness. Chest X-ray demonstrated patchy bilateral opacities and serum procalcitonin (0.53 ng/mL) was elevated. She was admitted to the intensive care unit with the diagnosis of sepsis. The next morning, bedside nurses noticed persistent face and arm myoclonus with worsening altered mental status that was concerning for status epilepticus. Scalp EEG showed marked background voltage attenuation and slowing, continuous 0.5-0.75 Hz bilateral independent periodic discharges (BIPDs) over the left and right hemisphere that evolved to form recurrent (approx. 5/hour) discrete seizures emanating from either right or left fronto-central-parietal regions (Figs. , ). Myoclonic status epilepticus with coma (MSE) was diagnosed and treated with intravenous levetiracetam, lacosamide, phenytoin, and midazolam to achieve burst suppression for 48 hours. Four days later, the EEG improved significantly with the cessation of epileptiform activity. However, clinically she worsened with multi-organ failure requiring blood transfusions and hemodialysis. Tracheal aspirate tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Due to a strict isolation policy to minimize the spread of COVID-19, the MRI brain was not obtained. Instead, a CT brain and perfusion study were performed a day after the MSE ceased, and it did not reveal any abnormality that could explain the etiology of MSE. For the next 3 weeks, multiple attempts to arouse or extubate failed after sedatives were held. Care was withdrawn, and the patient expired.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 45-year-old male patient visited the emergency room (ER) because of lower chest discomfort starting 6 hours earlier. He also complained of thirst and limb numbness. His medical history included diabetes mellitus, bronchial asthma, and unstable angina for 4 years, 2 years, and 1 year, respectively. He had been taking aspirin (100 mg/d), clopidogrel (75 mg/d), atorvastatin (10 mg/d), and candesartan (8 mg/d) for 1 year without changes. He took those medicines on the morning of his admission. He regularly used a Symbicort Turbuhaler® (AstraZeneca Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea) (160/4.5 μg) for asthma management. One month before the present admission, he discontinued the oral hypoglycemic agents prescribed by his primary physician. He denied recent alcohol consumption and had quit smoking 1 year earlier. Except for these symptoms, he initially had no complaints, such as muscular pain, fever, upper respiratory symptoms, or signs, on visiting the ER. He had no history of excessive physical activity or recent trauma.
On initial physical examination in the ER, his vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 100/60 mm Hg; heart rate, 71 beats/min; respiratory rate, 20 times/min; and body temperature, 36.6 °C. On chest auscultation, no abnormal sounds, such as rales or wheezing, were audible, and his heartbeat was regular without murmur. His general skin turgor was decreased, and his tongue was dry. His conjunctivae were not anemic and sclerae were not icteric. There were no palpable lymph nodes in the head or neck area. Organomegaly was not seen in the abdomen. No pretibial pitting edema, muscular swelling, or skin color changes were detected on either lower extremity. There was no tenderness in the upper or lower extremities. His muscle power was within normal limits.
Compared with a previous ECG, the rhythm and voltage were unchanged. His initial troponin-I was less than 0.1 ng/mL, creatinine kinase (CK) was 144 U/L (0–190 U/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 220 U/L (135–225 U/L), and CK-MB, subunit of CK, was 3.5 ng/mL. Other initial laboratory data were hematocrit 45% (39%–52%), hemoglobin 14.5 g/dL (13–17 g/dL), white blood cell count 11,280/mm3 (4000–10,000/mm3, neutrophils: 68.2%, lymphoid cells: 25.6%, and monocytes: 4.5%), and platelet count 256,000/mm3 (130,000–400,000/mm3). Liver function tests were as follows: alkaline phosphatase 84 IU/L (35–130 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 21 IU/L (0–37 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 42 IU/L (0–41 IU/L), and glucose 696 mg/dL. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 9.3% (4.2%–5.9%). Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were 19.9 mg/dL (6.0–20.0 mg/dL) and 1.11 mg/dL (0.6–1.2 mg/dL), respectively. Electrolyte results were sodium 123 mmol/L (135–145 mmol/L), potassium 4.7 mmol/L (3.3–5.1 mmol/L), and chloride 80 mmol/L (98–110 mmol/L). Serum osmolality was 296 mOsm/kg. Urinalysis with micro revealed no protein or blood on a dipstick and red blood cell 1 to 4/high-power field.
Continuous intravenous insulin and hydration with normal saline were started. In addition, 40 mg of esomeprazole was infused intravenously under a suspicion of GERD. Glucose levels, measured by a blood sugar meter, decreased to 240 mg/dL and chest discomfort improved 6 hours after this management. In the mean time, there were no other oral, intramuscular, and intravenous drug therapies except for oral lactulose for his constipation. He felt mild discomfort in the right buttock at that time but did not complain to the medical team. However, he complained of severe right buttock pain 12 hours after the esomeprazole infusion. Tender muscle swelling of 8 cm in diameter was seen in the right buttock area and a reddish skin color change was noted (Fig. ). Serum CK and LDH levels increased to 40,533 and 1326 U/L, respectively, and AST and ALT levels also increased to 320 and 83 IU/L, respectively. BUN and creatinine levels were 23.9 and 1.49 mg/dL, respectively. We started vigorous hydration through isotonic saline infusion and urine alkalinization by intravenous bicarbonate infusion. Another 40 mg of esomeprazole was administered because we did not regard esomeprazole as the causative agent of the rhabdomyolysis at that time. Serum CK, LDH, AST, and ALT levels were 84,226, 1943, 603, and 171 IU/L, respectively, 24 hours later. On the third day in hospital, he was admitted to the nephrology ward. Esomeprazole was ended, and hydration and alkalinization were continued. Serum CK and LDH levels decreased gradually (Fig. A and B), and his muscular symptoms and swelling in the buttock area improved gradually. A bone scan using 20 mCi of 99mTc-hydroxymethylene diphosphonate was performed on the seventh day in hospital and revealed multiple and diffuse uptake in the soft tissues of the right buttock and both lower legs (Fig. ). His clinical manifestations and laboratory findings improved, so he was discharged on the 12th day. We added oral hypoglycemic agents, linagliptin 5 mg and metformin 500 mg, to his previous drugs (aspirin, clopidogrel, candesartan, and atorvastatin). He is being followed in our outpatient department with no recurrence of rhabdomyolysis at 6 months.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 25-year-old lady presented to dental out-patient services with swelling and pain in the right side of the face. Local examination showed a fluctuant swelling measuring 5 mm × 3 cm over the right side of the angle of mandible []. The swelling was warm and tender on palpation with signs of impending rupture. Clinical examination of the orofacial region did not reveal any odontogenic or non-odontogenic foci of infection. Patient's vitals were in the normal limits. All the hematological parameters were normal except for borderline leukocytosis and a low hemoglobin level. Incision and drainage (I and D) of the abscess was carried out under local anesthesia. As the patient was in her 12th week of gestation, antibiotics were prescribed in consultation with the gynecologist.
On a follow-up visit after 2 weeks, a painless indurated swelling at the same site was noted [, inset]. Pus culture carried out during the incision and drainage had not revealed any bacterial growth. As the condition was not resolving, a fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was advised in consultation with the pathologist, to rule out tubercular infection.
Aspirate from the swelling yielded purulent material. The smears were moderately cellular and showed abundant necrotic debris within which were seen polymorphs and histiocytes. One of the smears revealed the presence of a single microfilaria of W. bancrofti, which was rounded anteriorly and tapered posteriorly []. The caudal end of the microfilariae had a clear space free of nuclei. After the aspiration, the patient was admitted and a midnight blood sample was taken. The wet mount preparation showed motile microfilariae, which confirmed the diagnosis of filariasis.
Since, the patient was in the first trimester of pregnancy, decision was taken to start the anti-filarial drugs after delivery.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 40-year-old male with no past medical history was found unconscious by bystanders after he had been out for a recreational jog. Upon the arrival of medical services, the patient was found to be in VF cardiac arrest and required two shocks before the return of spontaneous circulation. The downtime was reported to be about 15 minutes. Per history obtained from family members, the patient had never experienced any cardiac symptoms such as palpitations or chest pain and had no COVID-19 symptoms.
The patient had no significant personal medical history, took no medications, and exercised regularly with no difficulties. Family history was notable for coronary artery disease (CAD) in his brother, which had been diagnosed at age 50, and myocardial infarction (MI) in his father at age 72. There was no family history of sudden cardiac death.
Given the patient’s young age and absence of underlying cardiac issues, the differentials for his VF arrest were broad. Etiologies considered included ischemic heart disease, structural heart diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, anomalous origin of coronary arteries, myocarditis, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, primary electrical abnormalities such as long QT syndrome, and Brugada syndrome, and non-cardiac etiologies such as a massive pulmonary embolism (PE).
A basic metabolic panel showed no significant electrolyte abnormalities. The initial troponin-T level was within normal limits. Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission showed normal sinus rhythm, non-specific T-wave changes in anteroseptal leads, and a QTc of 445 ms (Figure ). A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal LV systolic and diastolic functions with no valvular pathology or regional wall motion abnormalities. A chest CT with PE protocol showed no significant pulmonary emboli. Per institutional policy, the patient was tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) via nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which returned positive. A subsequent SARS-CoV-2 antibody test was also positive.
The patient was emergently intubated for airway protection and taken to the catheterization lab where coronary angiography showed non-obstructive proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery disease with 55-60% stenosis and flow distal to the lesion with Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score of 3. Left circumflex and right coronary arteries were disease-free (Figures , ). The left ventriculogram showed normal systolic function with no wall motion abnormalities. The patient was then admitted to the ICU for therapeutic hypothermia. He received convalescent plasma, remdesivir, and dexamethasone for his COVID-19 infection. During his ICU stay, he had one episode of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the setting of agitation and hypoxia that terminated spontaneously in less than three seconds. He continued to improve and was eventually extubated and discharged home.
Later on, an outpatient single-photon emission CT (SPECT) pharmacological myocardial perfusion scan showed no anterior ischemia or scar (Figure ). A subsequent cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging showed normal LV and RV sizes and functions with no late gadolinium enhancement. The patient eventually received a single-chamber VVI implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) for secondary prevention of VF. Subsequent outpatient genetic testing with INVITAE® Arrhythmia and Cardiomyopathy Comprehensive Panel (Invitae, San Francisco, CA) revealed no genetic variants known to cause arrhythmia. At the one- and four-month follow-ups, the patient remained asymptomatic and ICD interrogation revealed normal sinus rhythm with no episodes of arrhythmia.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"The patient was a 51-yr-old woman with swelling of the extremities and bilateral ptosis on March 8, 2010. She complained of exertional dyspnea and weakness. She married at the age of 25. After that time, she developed drooping of her eyes, with the left eye drooping more than the right eye. Her symptoms persisted and they had gradually increased during about the last 10 yr. About 8 yr ago, she underwent a ptosis repair operation at a local clinic, but her symptoms were not improved. She denied a history of loss of consciousness, headache, dysphagia, dysarthria and myalgia. There was no family history of similar symptoms and no history of trauma. There was no previous history of diabetes and hypertension.
On examination, she was determined to be 151 cm in height and 48 kg in weight. The initial vital signs were a blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg, a pulse rate of 68 beats/min and a respiratory rate of 20/min. She was lethargic and had facial puffiness and no goiter. The lung and heart examinations were unremarkable. All the extremities showed pitting. She had marked bilateral ptosis, while the external ocular movements were normal (). The other cranial nerve examinations were unremarkable.
The laboratory findings were a total leucocyte count 4.75 × 103/µL with 61.6% polymorphs, a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, the random blood glucose was 124 mg/dL, the serum sodium was 130 mM/L, the potassium was 3.7 mM/L, the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 13 mg/dL, the creatinine was 0.8 mg/dL, the aspartate transaminase (AST) was 81 IU/L, the alanine transaminase (ALT) was 29 IU/L, the total bilirubin was 0.93 mg/dL, the creatine kinase (CK) was 1,195 IU/L (normal reference: 20-180 IU/L ), the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 517 IU/L (normal reference: 101-218 IU/L), the total cholesterol was 256 mg/dL, the triglyceride was 121 mg/dL, the high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was 40 mg/dL and the low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was 196 mg/dL. The urinary analysis was negative for blood and protein with using a dipstick. As the clinical findings suggested hypothyroidism and myasthenia gravis, a thyroid function test and acetylcholine receptor binding antibody test were done. The serum T3 was 0.195 ng/mL (normal reference: 0.86-2.02 ng/mL), the free T4 was 0.08 ng/dL (normal reference: 0.93-1.705 ng/dL), the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 2.08 µIU/mL (normal reference: 0.27-4.2 µIU/mL), the antimicrosomal antibody was 17 IU/mL (normal reference: 0-34 IU/mL), the antithyroglobulin antibody was 20.1 IU/mL (normal reference: 0-114 IU/mL) and the acetylcholine receptor binding antibody was negative.
Secondary hypothyroidism was suspected. We performed a careful history taking and other pituitary hormone evaluations. At the age of 26 the patient delivered her daughter and she had a history of massive postpartum vaginal bleeding. Thereafter she not resumed menses. The basal levels of other hormones were a serum cortisol of 4.03 µg/dL, the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was 29.64 pg/mL, the growth hormone (GH) was 0.06 ng/mL, the IGF-1 was 25 ng/mL (normal reference: 71-263 ng/mL), the prolactin was 1.59 ng/mL, the luteinizing hormone (LH) was 1.49 IU/L, the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was 4.91 IU/L, the E2 was 17.29 pg/mL and the testosterone was 0.02 ng/mL. The combined pituitary stimulation test, including the insulin tolerance test, the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation test and the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test showed panhypopituitarism (). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a finding of an empty sella turcica and there was no evidence of an intracranial mass, hemorrhage and aneurysm ().
Nerve conduction study (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) of the limbs reveled normal results with the exception of incidentally detected carpal tunnel syndrome. Needle EMG of the orbicularis oculi showed no evidence of dysfunction of the neuromuscular junction.
We diagnosed her as having Sheehan's syndrome, bilateral ptosis and subclinical myopathy caused by secondary hypothyroidism. Replacement with prednisolone of 10 mg/day and thyroxine (T4) 100 µg/day was started. The dose of prednisolone was decreased to 5 mg/day after 4 weeks. At 3 months follow-up, she had become euthyroid with normalized muscle enzymes. She recovered from her presenting symptoms and the bilateral ptosis was much improved ().","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"Over 8 months, a 40-year-old male presented with gait instability, numbness, progressive lower extremity weakness. His neurological examination revealed reduced sensation below the T10 level, and urinary hesitancy. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the thoracic spine demonstrated a 3 × 1.4 × 1.5cm lesion compressing the spinal cord at the T3–T4 level []. It markedly enhanced with contrast, but showed no classical signs of a “dural tail.” It was presumed to be a spinal schwannoma.
A T3–T4 laminectomy was performed. Upon opening the dura, a reddish encapsulated tumor was observed []. Progressive debulking of the lesion showed no dural attachment, but firm adhesion of the lesion to the lateral aspect of a spinal nerve; the tumor resembled a schwannoma []. To avoid a neural deficit, a marginal resection was performed, leaving the spinal nerve intact. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged home on the 4th postoperative day. Fourteen months postoperatively, the patient remained asymptomatic, without any motor or radicular thoracic sensory impairment. The follow-up contrast enhanced MRI was normal, and there was no residual/recurrent tumor at the T3–T4 level [].
Histopathology of the tumor revealed proliferation of meningothelial cells characterized by round-to-oval nuclei, small nucleoli, occasional pseudoinclusions, and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Cells were arranged in cords and small nests, and they appeared to grow around/intermingled with numerous blood vessels [] that were of variable calibre. There was also marked hyalinization. Histologically, the tumor was considered an AM. Meningiomas are defined as “angiomatous” (vascular) when at least 50% of the tumor mass is composed of blood vessels. Mitotic figures were not found, and special studies were not needed to confirm the meningothelial nature of the neoplasia.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 27-year-old female reported with the chief complaint of a “fractured filling” in her left lower back tooth. History revealed intermittent pain localized to the same tooth during mastication. The tooth was previously restored with a silver amalgam restoration 7 years back. Clinical examination revealed a silver amalgam restoration with secondary caries in the left mandibular first molar (tooth 19) which was tender to percussion. Vitality tests elicited no response. Preoperative radiographs showed widening of periodontal ligament space in relation to the mesial root apex. In addition, radiographic apical contour of the tooth suggested that there might be two distal and two mesial roots (). From the clinical and radiographic findings a diagnosis of pulpal necrosis with symptomatic apical periodontitis was made and endodontic treatment was initiated.
Following endodontic access cavity preparation, two mesial and one buccally placed distal canal orifice was identified. Upon visual inspection of the floor of the pulp chamber using a dental operating microscope, a dark line was observed extending from the distal canal orifice towards the distolingual corner. At this corner, the overlying dentin was removed and a second distal canal orifice was detected. The conventional access was modified to improve access to the additional canals (). Root canal orifices were named as per the nomenclature proposed by Albuquerque et al. []. Working length was confirmed () and the canals were instrumented. Calcium hydroxide was placed as an intracanal medicament with a lentulospiral and the access cavity was sealed with Cavit G. The patient was asymptomatic at the next appointment, a week later, which allowed for root canal obturation and a coronal composite restoration ().","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 23-year-old male with a history of migraine headaches for over 10 years was studied. The headaches responded favorably to usual analgesic treatment and worsened with physical exercise.
The patient looked for medical attention due to sudden and intense headaches in the occipital region with no evident cause, whose characteristics differed from the previous ones. An emergency computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, revealing the presence of a right occipital intracerebral hematoma that required immediate hospitalization and treatment for a month until resolution of the clot. One year after being symptom-free, he began to experience a mild to moderate oppressive headache in the right temporal region, which improved with analgesics for approximately 15 days. After that, the oppressive headache restarted with more intense hemicrania, accompanied by fatigue, short episodes of altered consciousness, sweating, multiple instances of projectile vomiting, and blurred vision of the left eye. General physical and neurological exams did not show any positive data, nor was there evidence of triggering events, such as traumatic brain injury, hematologic disorders, previous surgeries, or infections of the central nervous system (CNS).
Mood changes, including permanent irritability, aggressiveness, anxiety, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and temporo-spatial time disorientation, appeared during the follow-up period and a second CT-scan was performed.
Laboratory tests included the following: hemoglobin 133 g/L; leucocytes 8.1 × 103, platelets 373 u/L. A coagulogram indicated the following: suitable platelets, bleeding time 1.30 s, coagulation time 8 min, prothrombin time 15.2 s (control 13 s ± 3), and activated thromboplastin time 30 s; glycemia 4.83 mmol/L; glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) 42.51 U/L; glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GPT) 42.29 U/L; cholesterol 4.24 mmol/L; triglycerides 0.90 mmol/L; creatinin 82.81 μmol/L; uric acid 280 μmol/L; total protein 72.15 g/L; albumin 41.30 g/L; negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and non-reactive Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL).
Urgent multislice tomography showed a laminar SDH in the right fronto-parietal region, a posterior interhemispheric fissure at the level of the tentorium, and ipsilateral occipital intracerebral hematoma (2.2 × 2.3 cm in axial section), with a volume of 7 mL. These lesions produced a slight mass effect on the neighboring structures, and the midline was displaced 0.5 cm ().
Both hematomas were reabsorbed gradually (), with satisfactory clinical evolution after a two-month follow-up period. shows the increased frontal subdural hematoma and its extension to parietal and frontal lobes. Angiography revealed ecstatic cortical veins, one of them with saccular dilatation adjacent to the IPH (). For this reason, we decided to perform cerebral angiography, which confirmed the dural arteriovenous fistula. It connected the artery, a branch of the external carotid artery, with cortical veins in the superior sagittal sinus drainage (). After endovascular therapy, the evolution of the patient was satisfactory ( and ). Two years later, no bleeding had appeared, and the subsequent angiographic studies were negative.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"About 6 months before at 22 weeks of gestation, a cystic lesion was identified during a routine obstetric ultrasound examination of the pelvic area in a 23-year-old female patient without any previous discomfort. Due to the compression of the cyst on the cervix, the delivery was achieved by caesarean section. Postpartum ultrasonographic examination showed that there was a 7.5 × 8.5 cm sized thin-walled cystic lesion in the midline of the pelvic region compressing the rectum, uterus and bladder (). The origin of the lesion could not be determined during the ultrasonographic examination. The T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a thin-walled hyperintensity in the uterus, and the rectum posterior while T1-weighted images revealed a hypointense cystic lesion. The cyst was not associated with the ovaries. The fourth and fifth sacral bones were not seen. In the posterior, the cyst was communicating with the spinal subarachnoid space (). Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with sacral agenesis and anterior sacral meningocele. In addition, MRI showed that the conus medullaris ended at the 4th lumbar spine level and a distinct arcuate uterus was observed. The patient's neurological examination was normal. Complete blood count and serum biochemical tests were within normal limits.
Because she planned another pregnancy, gynecological surgeons and neurosurgeons suggested to the patient a surgical management. But she denied.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 43-year-old Mexican Hispanic man arrived in our hospital with a chronic headache. His neurological examination was unremarkable. The imaging workup showed a giant basilar artery aneurysm, dimensions 32 mm × 20 mm (Figure ), and that the lesion was located at an angled portion of the vessel. For the management of this aneurysm, we decided to place a stent at the aneurysm neck in order to: 1) straighten the shape of the parent vessel; 2) promote a shift in the pattern of the inflow into the sac and the outflow from the lesion; and 3) foster the thrombosis of the aneurysm.
The lesion was reached through a left vertebral approach with a 6F guiding catheter (Envoy, Cordis, Miami Lakes, FL). The medical periprocedural management at that time (1997) was empirical, as no rules for anticoagulation or antiplatelet treatment had been defined for intracranial stents. The vascular neurologist advised that the patient be placed under full anticoagulation without any antiplatelet drug. A 3.5 mm × 12 mm balloon-expandable stent (BES) (AVE Medtronic; Advanced Vascular Engineering, Santa Rosa, CA) was advanced and deployed at the neck of the lesion (Figures ).
When trying to retrieve the balloon, the stent slipped backwards and its distal end tilted towards the sac. (Figures ). We therefore decided to carefully slip the stent forward into the aneurysm by inflating the balloon again and pushing the stent distally until the whole of it was floating within the aneurysm (Figures ). A 3.5 mm × 18 mm BES was advanced into the lesion and subsequently deployed within the parent artery to cover the full length of the diseased portion of the vessel, including the aneurysm neck (Figure ) In the immediate post-procedural angiographic runs, we observed a sluggish intra-aneurysmal vortex motion and a correction of the shape of the parent vessel to a 45-degree angle was conducted. The neurological status of the patient was unchanged and he was then discharged to the neurosurgical ward.
A control digital subtraction angiography (DSA) performed four hours later to counter clinical deterioration showed thrombosis of the aneurysm along the basilar artery (Figure ). Rapid recanalization of the vessel was obtained through a mechanical procedure (balloon angioplasty) with the use of antiplatelet treatment (ticlopidine 250 mg and aspirin 100 mg) (Figure ). The patient subsequently recovered and this episode left a pontine stroke as a sequela (Figure ).
At ten years after the operation, the patient has a minor paresis, with a modified Rankin Scale of 2. A new imaging follow-up with DSA and three-dimensional reconstruction has been performed, which showed that the aneurysm remains occluded (no recanalization), the parent vessel is still patent, and no in-stent stenosis is present (Figure to ). The clinical evolution of the patient is described in Table 1.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 16-year-old male presented for evaluation of left shoulder pain, crepitus, and reduced ROM. Two weeks prior, he sustained a traumatic glenohumeral dislocation after a bicycle accident, which reduced spontaneously. Early rehabilitation provided no improvement to his restricted ROM or pain.
On physical examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable and extremely guarded. Apprehension and load and shift testing were consistent with anterior shoulder instability, and his ROM seemed reduced compared to typical dislocations. Plain film radiography revealed a 1 cm thin fragment of bone off the anterior glenoid, indicative of a bony Bankart (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed this, but on critical examination of axial cuts, the fragment appeared flipped with subchondral bone superficial to articular cartilage (). Based on his pain and the redislocation rate of his age group after traumatic dislocations, surgery was recommended [].
Intraoperatively, a posterior portal was created using bony landmarks, after which anterior and high rotator interval portals were established with the assistance of spinal needle localization to achieve an appropriate trajectory onto the glenoid. A 30° arthroscope was placed in the high interval portal, adjacent to the biceps tendon, and was used for subsequent exploration of the joint and image capture. A thin bony fragment with the articular surface deep and the bony surface superficial was present (Figures and ). Both articular cartilage abrasion (), possibly from articulating with the exposed subchondral fragment, and a small Hill-Sachs lesion were present on the humeral head. The anterior portal was used to allow access for a liberator, grasper, and rasp which were used to free up the partially healed fragment, achieve reduction, and freshen bony edges. A transsubscapularis (TSS) portal, as described by Dwyer et al., was established using a percutaneous set (Arthrex, United States) and a small metal 5.4 mm cannula to minimize potential injury to the subscapularis muscle []. The fragment was fixed using a double row technique as described by Millet and Braun using three Arthrex PushLock 2.9 mm anchors (Arthrex, United States) and #2 FiberWire suture (Arthrex, United States) (Figures and ) []. The capsule was then advanced over the top of the fragment using three additional PushLock anchors ().
Postoperatively, the patient had no major complications. He followed a graduated-intensity 18-week institutional physical therapy program consisting of two three-week and two six-week phases, which included passive and active ROM exercises and strengthening of shoulder musculature (). Plain film imaging four months postoperative indicated anatomic reduction of the fragment (). On examination, active shoulder ROM was assessed for both the repaired shoulder and the contralateral shoulder. Compared with the contralateral shoulder, the repaired shoulder exhibited the same ROM but lacked 15° of external rotation with hands at sides and 15° with the arm at 90° abduction. The patient was seen again six months postoperative and on examination exhibited excellent strength and no instability symptoms but still lacked 15° of external rotation both with arms at the sides and at 90° of shoulder abduction. By this point in time, the patient had resumed sporting activities including cross-country skiing and track and field.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 69-year-old female (patient 1 in ) developed a gait disturbance 6 months before admission and suffered from the gradual progression of weakness in her extremities. On admission, neurological examination showed proximal muscle weakness and reduced deep tendon reflex. Routine laboratory test results were unremarkable. Antinuclear antibodies, anti-acetylcholine (ACh) receptor antibody, and anti-voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibodies were negative. The results of chest and abdominal CT were unremarkable. In a nerve conduction study, CMAPs had slightly low amplitudes, and nerve conduction velocities were normal in the median and ulnar nerves. Needle EMG showed early recruitment and polyphasic MUPs with short durations and low amplitudes, suggesting the diagnosis of myopathy. Interestingly, the myopathic EMG findings were improved after sustained strong muscle contraction for 10 s; the MUP sizes returned to normal after a sustained strong muscle contraction, and the early recruitment of MUPs in the weak contraction was clearly normalized in the biceps brachii muscle (). Thereafter, we performed an RNS test because she complained of easy fatigability. The RNS test showed an obvious incremental response of the CMAP amplitude of the abductor digiti minimi muscle after high-rate stimulation of the ulnar nerve, indicating the diagnosis of LEMS [–]. We examined the patient for systemic malignancies, and the endoscopic examination of the colon revealed adenocarcinoma in the sigmoid colon. Her muscle weakness slightly improved after resection of the colon cancer.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 9-month-old male had undergone the right-sided VP shunt (Chhabra-slit-in-spring silicone shunt) procedure 7 months back for congenital hydrocephalus. He presented to us with complaints that the child protruded a white tube per anus on defecation for past 15 days with clear fluid dripping from it. On examination, the child was afebrile, alert and had no neck rigidity, and the abdomen was soft. On rectal examination, there was a white tube coming from beyond the reach of finger. Total leukocyte count (TLC) was 7200/cumm. An ultrasonography (USG) abdomen was normal. The sigmoidoscopy showed VP shunt protruding into the colon at 18 cm from the anal verge. The child was operated and the shunt was cut at abdominal surface through a small incision. The rest of the distal tube was extracted per rectum. The proximal tube was taken out as external drainage. On antibiotics, the child improved. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture done after 1 month was sterile and so a revision of shunt was done on the left side.

"A 30 years old male patient presented to the hospital with a 2-day history of high-grade fever and headache. Headache was diffuse, moderate to severe in intensity, associated with pain and stiffness in neck, photophobia and vomiting. Condition was not associated with blurring of vision, double vision, vomiting, loss of consciousness or convulsions. There was no history of sore throat, cough, ear pain, ear discharge, motor weakness, sensory weakness, hearing difficulty, altered level of consciousness, abnormal jerky movements or skin rashes. Patient also reported persistent colorless discharge from nose and postnasal drip for 4 months. There was no history of ear fullness, persistent headache or head trauma. Patient was non-smoker and there was no history of alcohol use.
6 weeks ago, patient was discharged from hospital after being treated as bacterial meningitis. The CSF examination for viral PCR and bacterial gram stain/culture was negative. He was treated with a 14-day course of intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone. He had complete recovery of symptoms without any neurological sequalae. During hospital stay at that time, he underwent MRI head which showed large bony defect in the sellar floor with soft tissue in the anterior aspect of the sella with infrasellar extension into the left sphenoid sinus ). Neurosurgery and otorhinolaryngology teams were consulted, and an elective endoscopic endonasal/open repair of the skull base defect was planned as outpatient after resolution of meningitis. Patient still had persistent rhinorrhea during this presentation as he did not undergo repair of bony defect of sellar floor.
Physical examination revealed a young adult well oriented to time, place and person. He was febrile with temperature of 38.9 degrees Celsius. Pulse, blood pressure and respiratory rate was normal. There were no skin rashes or scratch marks. GCS was 15/15. He had normal cranial nerves, motor and sensory examination. Neck stiffness, Kernig’s and Brudzinski’s signs were positive. Cardiovascular, chest and abdominal examination was normal.
Complete blood count revealed neutrophilic leukocytosis with raised C reactive protein. Urea, creatinine, electrolytes and liver function tests were normal. Lumbar puncture was performed and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed high white blood cell count with predominance of neutrophils, high protein and low glucose (). Viral PCR of CSF was negative. CSF culture showed gram negative coccobacilli () identified as Pasteurella multocida sensitive to ceftriaxone, ampicillin and penicillin. Blood cultures were negative. After confirmation of the organism, a retrospective history of contact with dogs, cats or other animals was taken which revealed that he often used to feed stray cats who lived around his house. However, there was no history of cat scratches, bites, licks or kisses on any part of the body. Patient was treated with IV ceftriaxone 2 g twice a day for 14 days with complete resolution of his symptoms. He was offered surgical correction of his skull defect, but he preferred to do it in his home country.

"A 57-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with chest pain followed by loss of consciousness. It was stated that loss of consciousness was not related to the patient’s position, and according to the eyewitness’ statement, the patient’s eyes were open at that time. Episodes lasted for approximately 2–3 min. During the episode, fecal and urinary incontinence, tongue-biting, and tonic–clonic seizures were not observed. The medical history revealed that the patient was taking 5 mg amlodipine and 50 mg metoprolol succinate due to hypertension; there was no history of alcohol or cigarette consumption. The patient was then hospitalized and admitted to the cardiology department. Sinus bradycardia (45/min) was detected on electrocardiogram (ECG) at admission, and the patient’s blood pressure was 165/63 mmHg. Then, beta blocker treatment was stopped. There were also no electrolyte disturbances on admission. No other pathology except sinus bradycardia was detected during 24-h ambulatory rhythm monitoring. On the third day of hospitalization, ST segment elevation at DII-DIII as well as aVF derivations and complete atrioventricular (AV) block were detected on ECG (). Emergency coronary angiography was performed, and diffuse spasm was detected at the left anterior descending, circumflex, and right coronary arteries (). After intracoronary administration of 300 mcg nitrate, vasospasm disappeared and ST elevation and AV block regressed (Figs. , ). Because the patient had bradycardia, diffuse spasm, and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia during ischemic episodes, dual implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was implanted. Then, 50 mg isosorbid 5-mononitrate and 90 mg diltiazem 2×1 po treatment was initiated. Episodes of syncope continued, and ventricular fibrillation reoccurred during an ischemic episode because of vasospasm. During follow-up, the diltiazem dose was increased up to 480 mg, and episodes were taken under control. In the sixth-month follow-up, the patient had no complaints of angina and syncope and his vasospastic episodes were under control with treatment.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 59-year-old female patient presented to her local family doctor with chronic generalized intermittent colicky abdominal pain and altered bowel habit for a few months. She has no other associated symptoms. She previously had laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) insertion 8 years prior with good result (BMI pre-procedure was 56 kg/m2, and now 36 kg/m2). Her other comorbidities include hypertension and colonic diverticular disease with previous acute diverticulitis. She was organized to have an elective colonoscopy. Colonoscopy revealed tubular foreign body embedded in the wall of colon, with an entry and exit point, ~55 cm from anal verge (Fig. ). There was also significant sigmoid and descending colon diverticular disease.
CT abdomen with oral and intravenous contrast was organized to further investigate the tubular foreign body. It revealed concurrent gastric band erosion into gastric lumen and connection tubing eroding into the posterior wall of transverse colon and exiting inferiorly (Figs –). There was no evidence of any oral contrast leak from the stomach.
This patient has previously been admitted for acute diverticulitis 4 years prior. Reviewing prior imaging did not reveal any gastric or colonic erosion. The gastric band tubing is noted to be running along the inflamed colon. Since the initial admission for acute diverticulitis, she has had multiple further acute diverticulitis episodes, which were treated with oral antibiotics. We suspect recurrent diverticulitis lead to the erosion of the gastric band into the colon and stomach.
As part of the surgical management, both colorectal and upper GI surgeon were involved in the operation. Patient underwent laparoscopic removal of gastric band and laparoscopic assisted wedge resection of transverse colon. The gastric band was removed following adhesiolysis and the gastric defect was repaired with intracorporeal suturing. The gastric band port was subsequently removed. Gastroscopy was done to ensure the repair was airtight. For the colectomy, transverse colon and splenic flexure was mobilized laparoscopically and the transverse colon was extracted through the gastric band port site for external inspection. A tract was identified passing from the antimesenteric border to colonic lumen and then along the colonic mesentery. A wedge resection performed with stapler end to side anastomosis. Flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed to confirm the anastomosis was airtight. Her post-operative recovery was uneventful, and she continued to be well on post-operative follow up in clinic. She remains well on subsequent phone follow up 12 months post operatively.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year. Exclusion Criteria: Younger than 65 years old, having decompensated liver disease, psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance, having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy.",0.5
"The patient is a 53-year-old woman, a registered nurse, who presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of weakness, headache, and blurry vision. She reported a 15-pound weight loss over the past 4 months, which she attributed to nausea, anorexia, and intermittent vomiting. Serum chemistries revealed blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 36 mg/dL and serum creatinine of 3.3 mg/dL. Electrolytes were normal as were her liver function tests. Complete blood count was normal and eosinophilia was absent. Initial urinalysis contained 3+ blood, 4+ protein, 32 RBC/HPF, 7 WBC/HPF, numerous hyaline casts, and no red blood cell casts. Renal ultrasonography demonstrated normal-size kidneys with increased echogenicity and no hydronephrosis.
Twelve months prior to admission, chemistries revealed a BUN of 25 mg/dL and serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, and 18 months prior to admission, BUN was 23 mg/dL with a serum creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL.
Her past medical history included hypertension treated for the past 4 years with bisoprolol plus hydrochlorothiazide (Ziac). She had a history of pseudotumor cerebri treated with acetazolamide (Diamox). She was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, but was not on treatment. Four years prior to admission, she underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy and sacrocolpopexy and colpoperineorrhaphy and cystoscopy. The surgery included use of RestorelleTM mesh and repair of a rectocele and enterocele. As a young adult, she underwent tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy and was involved in a motor vehicle accident with fracture of her left leg. The patient's maternal grandfather had diabetes, both parents have hypertension, and her one adult daughter is alive and well. She has no siblings. There was no history of autoimmune disease, glomerulonephritis, or chronic renal failure among her relatives. The patient had no history of international travel.
Review of system was negative for fever, chills, or night sweats. She experienced occasional palpitations and nonexertional chest pain. She described the chest pain as “acid reflux” and wondered if this caused her nausea and vomiting as well. She denied diarrhea, melena, and hematemesis. She noted trace edema and occasional foamy urine on and off for the past 6 months but no flank pain, dysuria, or visible hematuria. She denied neurologic symptoms, specifically no headache, vision changes, ataxia, or incontinence. She denied dry eyes, dry mouth, joint swelling, skin rashes, sun sensitivity, easy bruising, pleuritic pain, cough, or hemoptysis.
On physical examination, she was a well-appearing woman of Anglo-European heritage. Neurologic examination was normal. Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 and no murmur. Pulmonary examination showed clear lungs. Abdomen was benign without guarding and no bruits. No lymphadenopathy was present. She had no joint effusions or signs of arthritis. Lower extremities edema was only 1+ bilaterally.
During her hospital course, her bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide were discontinued and her hypertension was treated with carvedilol and amlodipine. She received intravenous fluids, but serum creatinine did not change. A 24-h urine collection contained a total volume of 1,450 mL, a total urine protein of 8,764 mg per 24 h, and total urine creatinine of 1,145 mg. Urine creatinine concentration was 79 mg/dL, with a serum creatinine of 3.5 mg/dL; thus, measured creatinine clearance was 22 mL/min.
A renal biopsy was performed and revealed a MPGN pattern. Double contours and suspected subendothelial deposits were appreciated on light microscopy. No thrombi, necrosis, or crescents were present. There was mild diffuse mononuclear cell interstitial infiltration and tubulitis noted. The interstitium had mild fibrosis. There was mild intimal thickening of the small arteries. Electron microscopy confirmed electron-dense subendothelial deposits without substructure. Since no glomeruli were present in the specimen submitted for immunofluorescence, a pronase antigen retrieval technique was used on sections prepared from the paraffin block. It revealed granular capillary wall staining with 2–3+ IgG, 2–3+ C1q, and 2–3+ kappa light chain and 1–2+ lambda light chain positivity. There was trace IgM and no IgA staining (Fig. , , ).
The patient was discharged home on carvedilol and lisinopril in lieu of the amlodipine. Before she was able to return to the renal clinic, she was readmitted 1 week after discharge for intractable nausea and vomiting. Admission blood pressure was 206/110. This was attributed to her inability to take her antihypertensive medications. Despite this, her serum creatinine improved to 3.1 mg/dL with BUN 22 mg/dL. Albumin level remained 3.4 g/dL. Urinalysis documented 3+ blood and 4+ protein as on her prior admission with numerous hyaline and granular casts per low power field. A 24-h urine collection contained a total volume of 875 mL and total urine creatinine of 744 mg. The urine creatinine concentration was 85 mg/dL. Total urine protein was 4,148 mg per 24 h. At the time of the 24-h collection, her serum creatinine was 3.7 mg/dL and creatinine clearance was 18 mL/min. Upper endoscopy demonstrated gastritis. Biopsies of the esophagus and duodenum were normal. Helicobacter pylori testing was negative. She was treated with an aggressive regimen of sucralfate, proton pump inhibitor, and H2 blocker.
Upon return to the clinic, 1 month after the biopsy, her blood pressure was reasonably controlled on lisinopril and carvedilol. Bone density was obtained and was normal. 25-hydroxyvitamin D was low at 19 ng/mL and ergocalciferol was started. By this time, a serologic search for an associated systemic disease included negative ANA, anti-double stranded DNA, HIV 1–2, anti-GBM, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ELISA), and rheumatoid factor. The sedimentation rate was elevated at 75 mm/h, and repeat measurement was 111 mm/h. Complement levels were unremarkable with C3 120 mg/dL and C4 slightly high at 41 mg/dL. Serum protein immunoelectrophoresis demonstrated normal IgA, low IgG (287 mg/dL), low IgM (38 mg/dL), and no monoclonal spike. Urine protein immunoelectrophoresis was without monoclonal spike, and the kappa/lambda light chain ratio was 3.28 (normal 2.04–10.37). Hemoglobin A1c level returned at 5.8%. Treatment with antacids, Lisinopril, and carvedilol was continued, and she was instructed to start prednisone 60 mg daily.
Eight weeks after the biopsy, the patient was evaluated at a tertiary care center. She reported taking 3 doses of prednisone but stopped it completely after an episode of visible hematuria. Lisinopril was changed to irbesartan due to persistent dry cough. Laboratory values at this time included a 24-h urine collection with a total volume of 950 mL, total urine creatinine of 950 mg, and urine creatinine concentration of 100 mg/dL. Total urine protein was 2,812 mg per 24 h. A separate random urine sample for protein to creatinine ratio was 1.67 (239/143). Anti-scl-70 was negative. She was counseled to not restart prednisone.
By week 12, her blood pressure was moderately controlled at 150/90. Because of cost, irbesartan was discontinued and losartan 100 mg daily was started. Chlorthalidone 25 mg daily was added for her blood pressure control. Atorvastatin 40 mg once a day was started for hyperlipidemia. She continued on carvedilol and antacids. Examination revealed no edema.
At her tertiary clinic visit 44 weeks after the biopsy, she reported feeling well and examination revealed blood pressure of 106/70 and no edema. Laboratory testing in the clinic included serum creatinine 1.6 mg/dL, BUN 25 mg/dL, serum albumin 4.5 g/dL, and a protein to creatinine ratio of 0.06. Urinalysis registered trace blood and no protein. One week prior to this visit, micro-albumin assay contained 7.4 mg/g (normal <15 mg/g), and the protein to creatinine ratio was 0.06.
Tertiary clinic visit 82 weeks after the biopsy demonstrated well-controlled blood pressure of 117/85. Urinalysis was negative for blood, protein, cells, and casts. Remission was sustained at 92 weeks with stable serum creatinine at 1.2 mg/dL, normal serum albumin, and inactive urinalysis without proteinuria.
Her serial serum creatinine, serum albumin, and urine protein to creatinine ratio values are listed in Table .","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"An 84-year-old male patient with past medical history consisting of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and open angle glaucoma was admitted to ICU via A & E with an unwitnessed collapse and decreased level of consciousness. In emergency department (ED) his GCS was recorded as 5/15, blood sugar was found to be only 34 mg/dL, his heart rate was 34 beats per minutes (bpm), and BP was 58/43 mm Hg. His ECG showed sinus bradycardia with variable blocks including sinus node dysfunction and type 1 Mobitz heart block pattern (Figures and ). He was intubated and ventilated in ED and given dextrose 50% 100 mL and 0.5 mg Atropine. His heart rate rose to 88 bpm and with improvement of heart rate and correction of blood sugar his BP became 135/88 and his GCS improved to 13/15. Unfortunately, heart rate started to drop again to 40 s and blood sugar showed a downward trend for which he was given 1 mg glucagon and was transferred to ICU. By the time he reached ICU his heart rate had improved to 90 bpm. In ICU after 30 minutes his heart rate dropped again so he was given another dose of Atropine and a temporary transvenous pace maker (TPM) was inserted. The patient's blood sugar also improved temporarily but eventually required intravenous infusion of 10% dextrose for the next 12 hours before it was stabilized. His GCS improved to 14/15 and he was extubated the next day 16 hours after admission but repeated attempts to switch off his pace maker revealed underlying brady-arrythmias with heart rate dropping to 34–40 bpm associated with presyncopal symptoms comprising of deterioration in attention and episodes of drowsiness. The pace maker was eventually switched off after 26 hours of observation when no more episodes of bradycardia were observed.
A detailed neurological assessment was carried out after extubation which showed the patient to be confused with no motor deficit. His CT brain was done which showed no abnormality and a detailed history was sought from the patient's wife who pointed out that the patient has been behaving in a weird and confused way for the last 5 days but his wife attributed that to demise of one of his close relative who died a week ago. She further added that he stopped taking his oral medications 2 days before he was admitted but he was given his eye drops regularly by his daughter who feared blindness in case the medication was not given. His drug history consisted of Enalapril 10 mg OD, Atorvastatin 10 mg OD, Metformin 500 mg BID, and Timolol Maleate 0.5% one drop each eye twice a day which was started 35 days before admission to ICU when he was diagnosed as a case of glaucoma.
Tilt table test was not carried out and keeping in view his improvement in blood sugar and heart rate after administration of glucagon his clinical picture of hypoglycemia, confusion, and bradyarrhythmia was recognized to be because of ophthalmic Timolol Maleate which was changed to Travoprost (a prostaglandin F2 analogue) after consulting the ophthalmologist.
The patient was kept under observation in ICU for another 24 hours. His intrinsic heart rate improved to 82 bpm and his TPM wire was removed before transferring to ward. Patient's confusion also improved gradually over the next 3 days and he was discharged on Enalapril, Travoprost, and Metformin. His followup for the next two months was unremarkable.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 74-year-old woman, with controlled hypertension and dyslipidaemia, presented to the emergency department due to altered speech, left-sided facial droop and decreased muscle strength on the right side of her body with 12 hours of evolution. Physical examination showed aphasia, central facial nerve palsy on the left side, slight right-sided hemiparesis, Babinski’s sign on the left and fever. Computed tomography of the head (head-CT) showed bilateral nucleocapsular and subcortical fronto-parietal ischaemic infarctions of unknown date. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm and the thorax x-ray a small left pleural effusion. Blood analysis showed 14,400 leucocytes/μl, increased C-reactive protein (217.8 mg/l), LDH 459 U/l and INR 1.57. The patient was medicated with aspirin and hospitalized with ischaemic stroke. Blood cultures were collected. Doppler ultrasonography of the neck vessels and a trans-thoracic echocardiogram showed no alterations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple acute ischaemic infarctions scattered over both cerebellar and cerebral hemispheres, reflecting strokes in the posterior and anterior circulations ().
Given the possibility of cardioembolic aetiology, enoxaparin was initiated (on the 7th day of hospitalization), however transoesophageal echocardiography showed no alterations. Neurological deficits deteriorated on the day anticoagulation was started, leading to prostration. Head-CT was repeated, revealing a massive parenchymal haematoma in the left frontal region which led to suspension of the enoxaparin.
After the most common stroke aetiologies were excluded, the following examinations were performed, but showed no alterations: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin and anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies, antithrombin III, proteins S and C, antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies, mutation of the prothrombin gene and factor V Leiden, and HIV, HBV, HCV and VDRL serologies. Antinuclear antibodies were positive (1:160) and D-dimers were high at 1,644 μg/l (normal <230 μg/l), while fibrinogen was low at 1.4 g/l (normal 2–4 g/l).
A whole-body CT scan revealed a solid lesion in the left lower lobe of the left lung, multiple mediastinal pathological lymph nodes, peripheral lung thromboembolism with greater expression on the right, right femoropopliteal venous thrombosis and splenic and renal infarctions (–).
Faced with the impossibility of resuming anticoagulation immediately, a filter was placed on the inferior vena cava. Cerebral angiography showed occlusion of the right internal carotid artery (recall previous normal Doppler ultrasonography of the neck vessels) and excluded vasculitis.
Endoscopic ultrasound-guided transoesophageal biopsy of a mediastinal lymph node revealed non-small cell lung cancer. Immunohistochemistry testing for the lung cancer subtype proved inconclusive.
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with multiple brain and systemic thrombotic events was diagnosed as a manifestation of a paraneoplastic syndrome of the hidden lung neoplasia. With favourable evolution of the brain haemorrhage, enoxaparin was resumed 2 weeks after the event. However, as there were new thromboembolic events despite the reintroduction of anticoagulation, it was definitively suspended due to progressively worsening thrombocytopenia.
During hospitalization, the patient remained feverish, with high inflammatory parameters, but no infectious source was identified and microbiological cultures were negative. Such alterations were considered to be correlated with systemic thromboses.
At this stage, the patient was mute and tetraparetic, with a level 4 performance status (ECOG). It was decided in a multidisciplinary meeting not to start cytostatics as no benefit was anticipated in view of the advanced neoplasia (stage IIIB/IV) and a high degree of dependence. The patient was referred to palliative care and died a few days later.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year. Exclusion Criteria: Younger than 65 years old, having decompensated liver disease, psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance, having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy.",0.5
"A six-month-old Caucasian male with no significant past medical history presented to the pediatric emergency department for a chief complaint of frequent unusual eye movements as reported by the parents. The patient began having intermittent rotary nystagmus approximately three weeks ago, and since then it progressed and became more continuous, worsened by changes in position or flashing lights from toys brought in his visual field. The parents also noticed the patient sleeping more than usual, only staying awake for an hour at a time, and had a subsequent severe regression in milestones, with an inability to roll over or sit unsupported.
Initial workup in the emergency department included a CT brain without contrast, which showed evidence of thickening of the bilateral optic nerves with associated masses and diffuse bilateral ventriculomegaly (Figure ). This finding was concerning for possible bilateral optic pathway gliomas, at which point a dedicated MRI of the brain and orbits was recommended, along with further genetic workup for possible neurofibromatosis I.
MRI of the brain and orbits confirmed these findings, showing diffuse enlargement of the optic tracts extending from the lateral geniculate nuclei to the optic chiasm and into the bilateral optic nerves, with a mass demonstrating 270º encasement of the bilateral supraclinoid internal carotid arteries and near circumferential encasement of the bilateral A1 segments of the anterior cerebral arteries (Figures , ).
These imaging findings confirmed the suspicion of bilateral optic pathway glioma, and as a result, the patient was admitted to the hospital and evaluated by both neurosurgery and pediatric hematology-oncology. Neurosurgery did not recommend any surgical intervention at the time, and the hematology-oncology team recommended proceeding with chemotherapy. His genetic testing results showed no evidence of clinically significant variants of neurofibromatosis I or II, suggesting a sporadic bilateral optic pathway glioma. The patient was then discharged and was followed up on an outpatient basis by both ophthalmology and pediatric hematology-oncology for maintenance chemotherapy with carboplatin and vincristine.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission. Exclusion Criteria: Individuals under 18 years of age, COVID-19 infection, Infection of the skin at the CGM site requiring removal of the sensor, Patients with altered Mental Status, Patients unable to scan their flash CGMs at least every 8 hours, Inability to provide written consent, Hospitalized for less than 24 hours.",0.5
"The case was of a 22-year-old woman complaining of headache for 18 months with severe episodes lasting around 6 hours, recurring about twice a month. Pain was located on the parietal regions, spreading to the orbit. Attacks were accompanied by nausea severe enough to hinder routine activities. The case was assessed by several specialists ruling out neurological, ophthalmological, and otorhinolaryngological pathologies. Cranial computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no pathology. Previous treatments considered nonsteroidal analgesics, physical therapy, hot and ice packs applications, and low-level laser therapy. All of them did not relieve pain to a satisfactory level. Her neurologist referred her to the orthodontic clinic suspecting a dilemma somewhere in her braces. The patient had fixed orthodontic appliance in the lower arch only with right first premolar extracted and space was closed with a satisfactory treatment outcome.
Clinical examination showed good oral hygiene with no signs of periodontal disease. Panoramic radiography (OPG) was normal. Occlusion was normal with no temporomandibular joint disorders. However, the patient reported that headache started 4 weeks after brackets bonding. At this stage, the patient was referred to a specialized center to test salivary biochemistry, particularly nickel and chromium levels. The chemical analyses were performed with a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer using unstimulated salivary sample.
After consultation with patient's neurologist, a decision was made to remove braces as soon as possible and provide her with a CAD/CAM zirconium bar as a bonded mandibular fixed retainer as the patient refused to wear any removable appliance. The treatment objectives were to (1) remove braces and retain teeth at their present position and (2) fabricate a bonded mandibular fixed retainer being biocompatible in attempt to relieve the patient's complaint.
Occlusal rests of 2 mm depth were prepared on the mesial surface of first premolars. Brackets were covered with wax prior to impression taking to facilitate its removal. A definitive impression of the mandibular teeth was made with an alginate impression material and the master model was prepared from type IV stone (ResinRock, Whip Mix Europe, Dortmund, Germany). The working cast was mounted on articulator and scanned in the S600 ARTI scanner (Ice Zirkon, Zirkonzahn-ZA9246A, Italy) to transfer the baseline landmarks from the mandibular arch directly to the software (). The CAD/CAM design included a 1.8 mm width and a 1.4 mm thickness zirconium bar extended on the lingual surface of lower teeth from canine to canine and at 3.5 mm away from the free gingival margin. Occlusal rests were connected to the bar as well (). The finished design was directly milled using Zirkonzahn's Screw-Tec system.
Zirconium does not chemically adhere to enamel; therefore, the inner surface of the milled bar facing teeth was reduced manually and placed under an infrared lamp to dry for 40 minutes and then sintered overnight at 1,600°C in a sintering furnace Zirkonofen 700. Later, a thin layer of feldspathic ceramic was fired onto the bar () and subsequently received the treatments sandblast, hydrofluoric acid etching, and silane coupling while the outer part was glazed (). The try of insertion of the entire bar into the patient's mouth proceeded properly ensuring good marginal fitness. The retainer was cemented with two dual-cured cement types (Variolink II and RelyX ARC). The occlusal rest on the left side needed minimal reduction ().
Salivary spectrophotometry analysis showed that nickel concentration was 4.230 μg/L and chromium was 12.520 μg/L. These concentrations were much lower than estimated toxic levels but comparable to the average dietary intake of nickel (200–300 μg/day) and chromium (280 μg/day) []. Several in vitro studies found that release reached a maximum within the first month of boding and then diminished due to formation of surface oxide film which resists corrosion, thus slowing down the release of metals []. However, the case is different here where measurable amounts of nickel and chromium release were recorded after 22 months of treatment alerting possible association with the complaint.
The patient reported pain relief two weeks following cementation, and headache subsided completely after 6 weeks. Another atomic absorption spectrometer analysis was performed to test salivary nickel and chromium levels which showed negligible concentrations which might explain the patient's complaint. The patient was reviewed regularly for two years reporting no complaint (). Clinical evaluation appeared to give good functional value where the marginal fit of digitized CAD/CAM design and glazed surface offered an enhanced approach of fixed retention.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 68 years old male had undergone total mesorectal excision 10 years before a skeletal metastasis of the lower leg was diagnosed. The patient was otherwise healthy except mild hypertension and there was no familial accumulation of endocrine or malignant diseases. Histology from the primary surgery showed a 5 cm intermediately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the rectum with no signs of neuroendocrine biology. The tumor was CK7 negative and CK20 positive. Distance to the nearest circumferential margin was 3 mm, and end resection margins were clear. There was no infiltration in the removed lymph nodes nor signs of distant metastases, thus the final TNM status was pT3N0M0. Total calcium was normal (2.37 mmol/L). Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) dropped from 18.0 μg/L preoperatively to 1.5 μg/L after surgery. No neo-adjuvant or adjuvant radiochemotherapy was given during the primary treatment. He underwent standard follow-up regimen with bloodwork, rectoscopies, ultrasound of the liver and chest x-ray for 4 years without any signs of relapse. CEA values were stable under 2.0 μg/L and only 1.0 μg/L when follow-up was completed.
Ten years after surgery, the patient presented with a tumor in the lower leg. X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging showed a 4.4 cm osteolytic lesion of the fibular head, in addition to a 4.7 cm tumor in the left lung and paratracheal pathological lymph nodes. Biopsies of the fibular head confirmed adenocarcinoma negative for CK7 and positive for CK20, and the pathologist concluded metastasis from the rectal cancer. The histological pattern was similar to the previously resected rectal tumor (Fig. ). CEA had now increased to 15.4 μg/L. He was treated by radiation therapy to the leg (8 Gy × 1) and commenced chemotherapy (fluorouracil, irinotecan, calcium folinate and bevacizumab). His lung pathology stabilized during this treatment and he reported less pain from the leg after the radiation therapy. However, the fibular tumor progressed radiologically and was 7 cm in diameter when it was resected 15 months after discovery. Resection margins were uncertain, and he developed a wound infection with a chronic fistula to the skin.
Three months later, the patient presented with hypercalcemia after being normocalcemic during all previous follow-up. Due to rapidly growing inguinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, he started treatment with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FLOX). CT-scan showed stable disease after three cycles of therapy. Bloodwork revealed that CEA had increased markedly to 380 μg/L. He developed severe hypercalcemia with free ionized calcium reaching 1.81 mmol/L (total calcium 3.33 mmol/L), concurrent with peaks in CEA and PTH levels (Fig. ). Creatinine and estimated GFR was normal, phosphorus was low (0.62 mmol/L), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D was low (24 nmol/L). He had no arrhythmias or other clinical symptoms related to the hypercalcemia. Fluid therapy and zoledronic acid had only short-lasting effect on the calcium levels. PTHrP was negative, but intact PTH was elevated to 54.4 pmol/L (normal range 1.1–7.5 pmol/L). The lab used a standard two-site immunoassay for measurement of the 84 amino acid long PTH, requiring binding in both the N and C terminals for detection. The high PTH led us to consider primary hyperparathyroidism as a differential diagnosis. Ultrasound of the neck and parathyroid scintigraphy with 900 MBq of 99mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) showed no signs of parathyroid adenomas. The diagnostic challenge was to distinguish primary hyperparathyroidism from ectopic PTH production in a colorectal bone metastasis or potentially another tumor.
To investigate if the tumor of the fibular head was responsible for the PTH elevation, we biopsied the tumor and stained for PTH. No significant staining was observed, using monoclonal antibody immunohistochemistry. Because such a large tumor can contain different clones of cells, a negative biopsy does not rule out that PTH could be produced from a part of the tumor not represented in the biopsy. Also, PTH immunohistochemistry on bone biopsies could be false negative for unknown technical reasons. We therefore measured blood PTH levels while excluding the lower right leg from the circulation by use of a blood pressure cuff on the thigh (modified Casanova test [], Fig. a). PTH levels measured in blood samples from the arm fell rapidly during the 20 min of right leg ischemia, consistent with local PTH production from the fibular tumor (Fig. b).
We concluded that the diagnosis was hypercalcemia caused by PTH secretion from the bone metastasis in the fibular head, and focused further treatment against the fibular tumor. The osteoclast inhibitor denosumab 120 mg was administered subcutaneously and further radiotherapy was given to the lower leg (3 Gy × 10). This made free calcium level stabilize at values around 1.40 mmol/L, and PTH was also attenuated (Fig. ). The patient received further cycles with FLIRI/bevacizumab until a year before his death. Six months before the patient died, another surge in PTH and calcium levels arose. Now, the patient received another course of radiotherapy (4 Gy × 5) towards his fibula, followed by a drop in PTH levels and normalization of calcium levels. No adverse events or side effects were reported by the patients or treating clinicians. The patient did not develop further episodes of severe hypercalcemia during the remainder of his life and died approximately 24 months after the first incident of severe hypercalcemia, due to disseminated disease involving skin, lymph nodes, lung, pancreas and brain.
As immunohistochemistry failed to show PTH in the fibular bone metastasis, we analyzed messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) from the same biopsies post mortem. Despite the long interval from biopsy to RNA extraction (5–16 years), we were able to extract total RNA from formalin-fixed paraffine embedded (FFPE) tissue sections and quantified PTH by reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). We found evidence of PTH transcription in both the original rectal specimen and in the fibular biopsy taken after onset of hypercalcemia, but not in the fibular biopsy that was taken before onset of hypercalcemia, nor in ipsilateral inguinal lymph node metastasis (Fig. ). This is consistent with development of clinically significant PTH production within the fibular metastasis, after local recurrence and radiation therapy to the lower leg.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 36-year old nulliparous female patient presented to our emergency department with acute lower abdominal pain, general discomfort, and elevated inflammatory markers. Her past medical history included obesity with a body-mass-index of 40, superficial vein thrombosis of the upper extremity and achilles tendon rupture. No bleeding abnormalities were reported. Cervical cancer screening including PAP smear was regularly performed and inconspicuous, most recently less than one year ago. On physical examination the patient presented significant rebound tenderness and involuntary guarding of the lower abdomen with a positive Blumberg sign. Speculum examination showed normal external female genitalia, normal vaginal epithelium, no abnormal discharge and a non-suspicious cervix. Significant cervical motion tenderness was observed during vaginal palpation. On vaginal ultrasound, the anteverted and anteflexed uterus showed no suspicious lesions. Bilateral adnexal masses with both cystic and solid aspects, remarkable hyperperfusion as well as free intraabdominal fluid were noted (Fig. a, b), suspicious for tubo-ovarian abscesses. During emergency laparoscopy, ruptured ovarian tumors with up to 8 cm sized cauliflower-like masses comprised of small cysts foremost of the right, but also of the left ovary were detected (Fig. a, b) and an enucleation of the cystic structures was performed.
On histopathological examination, a neoplasm with adeno-papillary growth of the inner female genital tract was described and the diagnosis of an eBOT with microinvasion of up to 1 mm was established. Following thorough postoperative discussion of the treatment options and their clinical impact, the patient decided against a fertility preserving approach favoring radical surgery including hysterectomy. Subsequently, laparoscopic staging was performed with hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, infracolic omentectomy and extensive peritoneal staging. In final histopathological results, an unexpected, HPV-high risk associated, intracervical endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the cervix uteri with a transversal diameter of 12 mm was diagnosed so that this was attributed as the primary tumor with ovarian metastases (Fig. a-f). Consistent with HPV high-risk association, the tumor showed strong immunohistochemical expression of p16 in the ovary and in the endocervix. CT scan of the thorax and abdomen showed no other distant metastases so that a subsequent laparoscopic lymph node staging was carried out to excluded tumor-infiltrated pelvic or para-aortic lymph nodes. Accordingly, final histopathological assessment led to a tumor stage of pT1b1 with ovarian metastases, pN0, L0, V0, Pn0, G2, R0, FIGO IB1. As individual decision making, an extended adjuvant treatment was applied consisting of chemoradiation followed by chemotherapy with four cycles paclitaxel and carboplatin according to the protocol of the currently recruiting OUTBACK trial (NCT01414608).","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"White female patient; nine years and nine months old. She had been overweight
since the age of six, and her mother noticed a decrease in growth one year
before the consultation. She also exhibited depression and anxiety. She used
prednisone until she was seven years old because of bronchial asthma. Height
1.34 m, Z score -0.49 (=P31); weight 59 kg, Z score 3.18 (>P97); BMI 32.9
kg/m2, Z score 3.54 (=P99); Moon facies, Tanner development stage
of M2 P3, generalized obesity with fat deposition in supraclavicular fossa,
cervical acanthosis nigricans, fine axillary hairs, thin purplish stretch marks
in abdomen and breasts. Bone age of a nine or ten-year-old, with a chronological
age of nine years and six months old.
ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism was confirmed (). The 1.5T MRI with a dynamic study did not demonstrate the
presence of adenoma at the age of 9 years and 10 months, but in the 3T MRI with
a dynamic study performed at age 10 years and 3 months, the sagittal cut in the
T1 TSE sequence after the administration of (gadolinium) contrast, demonstrated
the contrast-enhanced, oval-shaped image of the anterior adiphyophysis measuring
3 × 2.3 × 2.1 mm. Details of the examination technique are described in . The patient underwent
transsphenoidal surgery at ten years of age. She continued to grow with
transient diabetes insidious and central permanent hypothyroidism. She presented
insufficient adrenal in the postoperative period, which is compatible with the
cure for hypercortisolism. She used prednisone for two years. She showed
progressive weight loss. Her final height was 1.51 m, with a family target of
1.59 m. She presented new weight gain without the recurrence of
hypercortisolism.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.
