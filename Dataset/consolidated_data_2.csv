"A 5.5-year-old boy visited the Endocrinological section of the Pediatric Unit of the General Hospital of Terni, Italy, due to short stature. His mother's height was 170 cm, and his father's height was 172 cm (target height: 177.5 cm = >50° centile). In his family history, there was paternal familiarity for psychotic crises in his adolescence and mother with thrombophilia and history of five pregnancies with three spontaneous abortions and two parts. The mother took cardioaspirine during the pregnancy. No genetic disease was reported in his family. The child was born at term via spontaneous vaginal delivery. The birth weight was 3.050 gr (10°-25° centile), and the birth length was 45 cm (below the third centile). A villocentesis performed at week 12 of gestation due to an alteration in nuchal translucency on obstetric ultrasound did not reveal any abnormality (46, XY). After birth, a small ventricular septal defect and mild bilateral pyelectasis were detected, but within 6 months, both of these abnormalities spontaneously disappeared. Bilateral orchiopexy was performed at 19 months of age for undescended testicles. Regarding linear growth, auxological data recorded by the primary care pediatrician revealed short stature that was 2 standard deviation (SD) below the 3° centile on the Italian cross-sectional growth charts for height () since the first months of life. In the last 2 years, the child has exhibited an even more exacerbated decline in his growth curve. Before entering the hospital, first-level laboratory tests for the evaluation of short stature (i.e., full blood count, inflammatory markers, renal function, hepatic function, coeliac screening, and thyroid function tests) had been already performed. No abnormal results were evidenced. The bone age was delayed by 2 years.
In the hospital, his height was 99.2 cm (<3 SD), his weight was 15.5 kg (<3° centile), and his growth velocity was 4 cm/year (<3° centile). His arm span was of 94 cm, and his sitting height was of 55 cm: height ratio was <95%, his sitting height: height ratio was therefore >56% (slightly over the upper normal limit of 55.5%), and his body mass index was below the 50th centile (pathological Rappold index >8). Furthermore, he presented with unusual facial features that included hypertelorism, low-set ears, a low posterior hairline, down-slanting palpebral fissures, pectus excavatum, and ogival palate (Figure ).
However, Madelung deformity was not suggested by clinical examination and not detected by wrist X-ray findings. Radiological and laboratory tests to rule out related renal, cardiac, ophthalmologic, and audiological abnormalities did not find any significant alterations. At an evaluation conducted by an infant neuropsychiatrist, the patient exhibited a mild cognitive impairment compared with the standard for his age that included a prevalent verbal difficulty compatible with the diagnosis of NS. EEG and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging results were normal. The peak growth hormone (GH) value in a clonidine stimulation test was in the normal range (12.7 mg/L). The IGF-1 level was 47 ng/mL (normal values for age: 32–259 ng/mL).
Although short stature was disproportionate, diagnosis of NS was suspected, and genetic tests of the PTPN11 gene were requested. The entire coding regions and intron-exon boundaries of the PTPN11 gene were amplificated by polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA and sequence specific primers. Both forward and reverse strands were directly sequenced using an automatic DNA sequencer. The results confirmed NS because a c.922A>G (rs28933386) heterozygous mutation in exon 8 of the PTPN11 gene leading to a p.Asn308Asp substitution was identified (reference transcript NCBI NM_002834.3 and NP002825.3). This mutation has already been described as pathogenic by Siegfried et al. ().
Due to the presence of a mesomelic short stature, the concurrent presence of two genetic mutations was considered and a genetic evaluation of the SHOX gene was requested. A test of chromosomal microarray analysis performed with the CGH array led to the identification of a micro-duplication at the level of the region PAR 1 (Xp22.33/Yp11.32) extended about 680 kb involving the SHOX gene. The microduplication in the pseudoautosomal region PAR1 has already been described in NS and its clinical significance therefore appears to be certain ().
GH treatment (0.2 mg/kg/wk) was prescribed. At a follow-up assessment 18 months after the initiation of GH treatment (weight-appropriate dosage), the following data were collected: height, 109.8 cm (<2 SD); weight, 18 kg (<3° centile); growth velocity, 7 cm/year (>90° centile); arm span:height ratio, 96%; sitting height:height ratio: 56%. Further evaluations have been scheduled for every 6 months.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 40-year-old male with no past medical history was found unconscious by bystanders after he had been out for a recreational jog. Upon the arrival of medical services, the patient was found to be in VF cardiac arrest and required two shocks before the return of spontaneous circulation. The downtime was reported to be about 15 minutes. Per history obtained from family members, the patient had never experienced any cardiac symptoms such as palpitations or chest pain and had no COVID-19 symptoms.
The patient had no significant personal medical history, took no medications, and exercised regularly with no difficulties. Family history was notable for coronary artery disease (CAD) in his brother, which had been diagnosed at age 50, and myocardial infarction (MI) in his father at age 72. There was no family history of sudden cardiac death.
Given the patient’s young age and absence of underlying cardiac issues, the differentials for his VF arrest were broad. Etiologies considered included ischemic heart disease, structural heart diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, anomalous origin of coronary arteries, myocarditis, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, primary electrical abnormalities such as long QT syndrome, and Brugada syndrome, and non-cardiac etiologies such as a massive pulmonary embolism (PE).
A basic metabolic panel showed no significant electrolyte abnormalities. The initial troponin-T level was within normal limits. Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission showed normal sinus rhythm, non-specific T-wave changes in anteroseptal leads, and a QTc of 445 ms (Figure ). A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal LV systolic and diastolic functions with no valvular pathology or regional wall motion abnormalities. A chest CT with PE protocol showed no significant pulmonary emboli. Per institutional policy, the patient was tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) via nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which returned positive. A subsequent SARS-CoV-2 antibody test was also positive.
The patient was emergently intubated for airway protection and taken to the catheterization lab where coronary angiography showed non-obstructive proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery disease with 55-60% stenosis and flow distal to the lesion with Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score of 3. Left circumflex and right coronary arteries were disease-free (Figures , ). The left ventriculogram showed normal systolic function with no wall motion abnormalities. The patient was then admitted to the ICU for therapeutic hypothermia. He received convalescent plasma, remdesivir, and dexamethasone for his COVID-19 infection. During his ICU stay, he had one episode of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the setting of agitation and hypoxia that terminated spontaneously in less than three seconds. He continued to improve and was eventually extubated and discharged home.
Later on, an outpatient single-photon emission CT (SPECT) pharmacological myocardial perfusion scan showed no anterior ischemia or scar (Figure ). A subsequent cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging showed normal LV and RV sizes and functions with no late gadolinium enhancement. The patient eventually received a single-chamber VVI implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) for secondary prevention of VF. Subsequent outpatient genetic testing with INVITAE® Arrhythmia and Cardiomyopathy Comprehensive Panel (Invitae, San Francisco, CA) revealed no genetic variants known to cause arrhythmia. At the one- and four-month follow-ups, the patient remained asymptomatic and ICD interrogation revealed normal sinus rhythm with no episodes of arrhythmia.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 70-year-old hypertensive and diabetic male patient was admitted to our ICU with respiratory distress following COVID-19 infection. Chest x-ray showed bilateral diffuse infiltrates. ABG on 15 L of oxygen by non-rebreathing mask showed severe hypoxia (Pao2/Fio2 < 100), and respiratory acidosis with pH 7.52, PO2 56.3, PCO2 31.5, SpO2 <90. We gave non-invasive ventilation (CPAP) support with Fio2 80%, pressure support 14, and PEEP 7 (cm H2O). On the third day of CPAP therapy, the patient was unable to maintain oxygen saturation (SpO2 < 92%) despite FiO2 100% and became more tachypnic (RR > 40). There was increased respiratory distress and SpO2 decreased to <90% despite FiO2 100%. We gave supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula with O2 flow 10 L by another flowmeter (). The patient became more comfortable, and SpO2 increased to 95%. ABG showed PO2 90 mm Hg, PCO2 35, and SpO2 97%.

"A 73-year-old male, medical doctor, widower for 2 years, lives in the house with his two children. He is a social ethicist, smoker for 40 years, and quitted smoking 18 years ago as a response for the diagnosis of pulmonary emphysema, asthma, and systemic arterial hypertension (SAH). 10 years ago, he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. For the long-term asthmatic status, he uses formoterol fumarate dihydrate 200 mg with bisoprolol hemifumarate 1.25 mg daily (inhaled bronchial dilator) 1x daily; for systemic arterial hypertension, losartan and hydrochlorothiazide 50/12.5 mg (morning and afternoon); for dyslipidemia, rosuvastatin 20 mg, AAS 100 mg.
Two months after starting SC, the patient reported having an important hypoglycemic attack (glucose level of 27 mg/dl) (). 3 hours after starting this episode, this patient still presented dysarthria, mental confusion, and loss of consciousness and was hospitalized in the ICU with good recovery after glucose replacement. The use of SC was suspended during the hospitalization period, and the medication for diabetes was resumed. After dismissal from the hospital, SC was reintroduced at a dose of 25 mg 3 times per day, and postprandial glucose remained around 138 mg/dl, even when consuming sweets; sulfonylurea (gliclazide) has been discontinued and home glycemia ranged from 101 to 117 mg/dl.

"A 58-year-old female patient, who was a known case of hypertension and hypothyroidism taking tablet L-thyroxine 50 mcg once a day and tablet metoprolol 25 mg twice a day regularly presented on 17th April 2020 with chief complaints of low-grade intermittent fever, generalized body ache, running nose and soreness of throat for last 3 days. Her reverse transcriptase by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 was done at Civil hospital, which returned positive. Her husband was also symptomatic for COVID-19 and was also tested positive. Both were admitted in Civil hospital on 19/4/2020. Her chest laboratory parameters including complete blood count and X-ray were normal []. She was treated with azithromycin 500 mg once a day for 3 days along with paracetamol 500 mg thrice daily apart from multivitamins. Patient became asymptomatic after 2 days. Her repeat RT-PCR for COVID-19 was done on 28th and 29th April 2020 which both returned negative after which she was discharged on 29th April 2020. Her husband had COVID-19 pneumonia for which he remained hospitalized in civil hospital for 23 days and was subsequently discharged on her regular medication for hypertension and hypothyroidism at home. She was asymptomatic for almost next 4 months.
On 17th August 2020, she again developed symptoms in form of intermittent 101°F fever, generalized body ache, dry cough, and throat pain. Her rapid antigen test (RAT) returned positive. Her husband was negative on this occasion. Patient needed rehospitalisation on 19th August 2020 where her RT PCR for COVID-19 also returned positive with cycle threshold (CT score) of 18 suggestive of high viral load, thus confirming a case of reinfection with COVID-19. Total antibody and immunoglobulin G antibody test for COVID-19 were negative suggestive of non-existent immunoglobulin memory from previous COVID-19 infection. Her inflammatory profile revealed CRP of 17.8 mg/L and IL-6 of 15.4 pg/ml with otherwise normal X-ray chest (shown below) and other reports.

"A 62-year-old, white, Caucasian, British-origin, male lorry driver was admitted to the hospital late on a Friday night after an unwitnessed single vehicle road accident. His lorry was by the side of the road and he was found unconscious in the vehicle and immediately transferred to the local District General Hospital. On admission, he had already fully recovered, being alert and orientated but he had no recollection of the accident. He was haemodynamically stable, with normal vital signs and no neurological deficit. He complained only at a moderate headache. Physical examination has revealed a bruise on the upper part of his left anterior chest wall, left shoulder and forehead. The rest of the examination was entirely normal. The radiological investigation that followed included cervical spine and left arm X-rays in which no fracture was noted. A mobile AP chest X-ray was also done on admission, in which it was demonstrated a dilated aortic arch (). A subarachnoid hemorrhage was found on a moderate quality brain CT-scan (), which was attributed to traumatic brain injury and the patient was transferred to the regional Neurosurgical centre as a post-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage for observation. During the next two days, the patient was well without any neurological defect and he has been gradually mobilized without any major complaint. On Monday however, brain CT interpretation by a more senior member of the medical staff suggested that this may not be a post-traumatic but rather an aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A CT angiogram confirmed that his SAH was of aneurismal origin, due to the rupture of an anterior communicating artery (Acom) aneurysm () which was the actual reason for his accident. As the patient was neurologically intact and stable, an embolisation procedure for endovascular treatment of this aneurysm was decided for the following day (day 5 since the SAH event). Under general anesthesia, the right common femoral artery was punctured and a 6F appropriate vascular sheath was placed following our protocol for endovascular procedures. During the first attempt to catheterize the aortic arch for the standard pre-embolisation angiogram, an unusual dilatation of the thoracic descending aorta was noted, just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. The combination of these findings with the bruise in the upper left chest, made us suspicious of an aortic injury. The embolisation procedure was abandoned and an aortogram revealed an aortic dissection just distal to the left subclavian origin (). The patient was woken up and a chest CT followed, which confirmed the diagnosis of a post-traumatic dissection of the descending aorta. Subsequently, he was transferred to the cardio-thoracic unit and an aortic stent was successfully deployed for endovascular repair of the dissection (). He had an uneventful recovery and two weeks later, endovascular treatment of his Acom aneurysm was performed with platinum coils (). At the same time, a posttraumatic dissection aneurysm of the right common carotid artery (CCA) at its cervical segment was also found (). This was clinically silent, treated conservatively at that stage [] and the patient was eventually discharged three weeks after the primary event. At the six month follow-up, the patient had made a very good recovery and returned to full activities. The aortic dissection was not visible anymore in imaging but there was a recurrence of the previous coiled Acom aneurysm due to coil compaction. Thus, a new embolisation procedure with platinum coils was performed to treat this aneurysm recurrence. At the same stage, the right CCA dissection aneurysm was endovascularly treated using platinum coils, as it showed no signs of regression [,].","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 69-year-old male patient presented with stuporous mentality after fall from 2-meter height. On admission, the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 7/15. Neurological exam revealed no further abnormalities. Brain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an ICH in the left temporal lobe with diffuse SAH and subdural hemorrhage (). A brain CT angiography revealed a pseudoaneurysm of MMA (). Sequentially, the patient was submitted to cerebral angiography and the left external carotid angiogram revealed a pseudoaneurysm arisen from the anterior branch of the MMA accompanied by dAVF at the middle segment of sphenoid ridge (). Through the right common femoral artery, a guiding catheter (Envoy 6 Fr; Cordis/Johnson & Johnson, Miami, FL, USA) was positioned in the left external carotid artery. We carefully naviated a microcatheter pre-shaped 45 degrees (Excelsior SL-10; Stryker Neurovascular, Fremont, CA, USA) under the guidance of a 0.014-inch microguidewire (Synchro 14; Stryker Neurovascular) to reach the juxtaproximal to the pseudoaneurysm via MMA. After the confirmation of the appropriate position of the microcatheter via repetitive superselective angiography (), embolization of a pseudoaneurysm and MMA was performed using 25% n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) (Hystoacryl; B. Braun, Melsnagen, Germany) mixed with iodized oil (Lipiodol; Guerbet, Aulnay-sous-Boid, France). We achieved angiographically complete occlusion of a pseudoaneurysm and dural AVF (). Follow-up brain CT scan showed no significant hematoma enlargement and well penetrated glue cast at the all the vascular lesions ().
The patient presented an improvement in consciousness for GCS score 15 after 12 days. However, at the 18-day after the procedure, the right side weakness and dysarthria were developed. Brain CT angiography and subsequent left internal carotid angiography revealed cerebral vasospasm at the distal segment of MCA with multiple low densitied at the left MCA territories (). Cerebral vasospasm was treated using intra-arterial (IA) nimodipin infusion, and it was improved. At discharge, dysarthria was improved, but right side weakness was remained (Grade 3).","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 42-year-old man with no past significant medical illness presented with headache. CT scan done showed subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) predominantly in the perimesencephalic cisterns []. Magnetic resonance imaging T1 gradient sequence also showed the hypointense signal suggestive of blood products in the perimesencephalic cisterns []. Fetal posterior cerebral arteries are seen on both the sides arising from the internal carotid artery [Figures and ]. DSA (digital subtraction angiogram) done subsequently revealed fusiform bulbous dilation involving both the cisternal and cortical segments of the left SCA []. Endovascular treatment in the form of parent artery occlusion was done under general anesthesia, with complete exclusion of the aneurysm from the circulation as seen on post-coiling angiogram []. Standard heparin protocol was followed and activated clotting time greater than 250 s was maintained during the procedure. Six-French (6F) Envoy (cordis) guiding catheter was placed in the distal vertebral artery. A combination of echelon-10 microcatheter (ev3) and transcend 0.014 microwire (Stryker) were used to access the aneurysms. Multiple Axium (ev3) coils were used to occlude the aneurysm. There were no intra- and periprocedural complications and patient was discharged on the 5th day after operation. The post-operative course was uneventful. The patient's neurological examination after 1 month was completely normal.

"A 64-year-old man, who had a history of hypertension, presented with headache and vomiting. CT scan showed SAH in the superior cerebellar cisterns []. DSA done revealed a fusiform aneurysm of the distal SCA, predominantly involving the branch of the cortical segment [Figures and ]. Standard heparin protocol was followed and an activated clotting time greater than 250 s was maintained during the procedure. 5F Envoy (cordis) guiding catheter was inserted in the distal vertebral artery. The aneurysm was accessed with a combination of micro-catheter (echelon-10) and micro-wire (traxcess12). Meticulous pre-shaping of the micro-catheter according to the shape of the target aneurysm aided in proper positioning of the micro-catheter in the aneurysm which was subsequently packed densely with the platinum micro-coils. Post-procedure angiogram showed complete exclusion of the aneurysm along with the branch of the cortical segment and preservation of the flow in the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) []. There were no untoward events in the post-procedure hospital stay and patient was discharged after 1 week. No neurological deficit was seen during the clinical follow-up after 1 month.

"A three-year-old male child was admitted to the pediatric ward of Dr. Ruth KM Pfau, Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK) with a one-year history of generalized weakness, loose motions, decreased appetite and intermittent fever not associated with rigors, chills or night sweats, an eight-month history of inability to walk and sit, polydipsia, polyurea, abdominal distention and loss of neck holding for 14 days. He had a previous history of hospitalization six months ago due to the same complaints. The patient was accompanied by his mother. He weighed 6 kg, is the 7th born child to his parents and was delivered at term to a 37-year-old G7P7 mother via normal vaginal delivery. The mother did not report any complications or illnesses during pregnancy. He cried immediately after birth, and there were no complications during or after birth. There is no consanguinity between mother and father. The child was vaccinated but was malnourished, with an unremarkable family history.
The patient also developed diarrhea which was bulky in consistency, green in color with seven episodes per day after every meal intake. Diarrhea was associated with abdominal distention and vomiting. The mother then started giving him a combination of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, after which diarrhea subsided. The child developed neck holding at four years of age, he started sitting at eight months and started walking with support at 12 months of age. The child was first breastfed within three hours of delivery and was exclusively breastfed up to six months. Complimentary feeding was started after six months with pulses, mashed potatoes, porridge and chicken. Breastfeeding was continued up to two years. Currently, the child takes 1-2 feeds per day. The personal history revealed that the patient was sleeping normally, but the appetite was decreased. The mother also noticed a weight loss, altered bowel habits, and micturition was normal.
On examination (O/E), the patient was lying on the bed irritated, severely wasted and emaciated with visible bony deformities. Initial vitals included blood pressure (BP) 110/70 mmHg, a regular pulse of 90 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and a low-grade fever of 100° F. The patient was anemic and dehydrated, while, there was no presence of edema, clubbing, cyanosis, and lymphadenopathy. On further examination, parietal and frontal bossing, rachitic rosary (Figure ), widening of wrists and knock knees (it's a valgus deformity in which legs curve inwards so that the feet are apart when the knees are touching) were found as well. On abdominal examination, it was soft, non-tender, distended with mild tenderness on both flank regions, with a centrally placed umbilicus. The liver was palpable three fingers below the right costal margin. Gut sounds were audible 3-4 sounds/min. All other systems were unremarkable.
The anthropometric measures of the child are as follows: weight = 6.5 kg, occipitofrontal circumference = 49.5 cm, height = 72.5 cm, mid-upper arm circumference = 8 cm, upper segment = 45 cm, lower segment = 27.5 cm, weight for height = 6.5/9 *100 = 72.2 (moderately low) and height for age = 72.5/94.6*100 = 76.6 (severely low).
On investigations performed, complete blood count (CBC) showed a hemoglobin (Hb) of 5.4 gm/dl, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 82 fl and a platelet count of 187,000/mL. The total leukocyte count (TLC) was 10.6 x 109/L, including 39% neutrophils and 48% lymphocytes. His inflammatory markers were raised with a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 23 mg/L [Normal (N) = 3] and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 115 mm/hr (N = 0-22) for men and (N = 0-29) for women. The clotting profile showed an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.01, while prothrombin time (PT) was 10.6 seconds.
The urea creatinine electrolytes (UCE) were within normal range except decreased potassium levels of 2.8 mEq/L. The levels of calcium, magnesium and phosphate in blood were 15.1, 1.9 and 4 mg/dL, respectively. The blood culture showed a growth of Burkholderia species. The urinalysis showed a pH of 5.0, specific gravity of 1.025, with the presence of protein and blood. Additionally, numerous red cells were seen along with yeast and 4-6 pus cells per high power field (HPF). The urine culture showed growth of Candida species. The stool analysis showed that the stool was hard, acidic, brown in color with 1-2 pus cells per HPF. His vitamin D levels came out to be 54.29 ng/mL, and parathyroid levels were 8.36 pg/ml. Liver function tests showed a total bilirubin of 0.28 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 0.21 mg/dL and levels of alkaline phosphate alanine aminotransferase were 368 and 3 units per liter, respectively.
The X-rays of the chest (Figure ), skull (Figure ) and femur (Figure ) are attached below. Additionally, ultrasound of kidney ureters and bladder (KUB) showed an incidental finding of bilateral renal calculi (right kidney at lower pole measuring 0.7 cm, in the left kidney at mid pole measuring 0.7 cm), along with bilateral grade 2 renal parenchymal changes. The urinary bladder was normal in thickness with no presence of focal mass, calculus or diverticulum.
Considering the diagnosis of OI, an ophthalmology review was done to look for lens dislocation and blue sclera, but neither was present in both eyes. However, the left eye showed a corneal thinning nasally, temporally and inferiorly.
During the hospital stay, the patient was intravenously given cefotaxime 220 mg, piperacillin-tazobactam 700 mg, and meropenem three times a day. Additionally, linezolid 70 mg was injected every eight hours, along with injections of bisphosphonate 7 mg for three days, amikacin 55 mg twice a day for 14 days and fluconazole 85 mg loading dose, 45 mg once a day for 10 days. The patient was also given a teaspoon of the combination (artemether and lumefantrine) once a day. Three pints of red blood cells were transfused as well, after which his Hb became 10.6 mg/dL. During the stay, the child had a prolonged course of fever with pancytopenia, which improved on injections of meropenem, amikacin, and fluconazole.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 46-year-old male visited the emergency department of our hospital on April 23, 2015 due to fever and headache for three days and impaired memory for half a day. The patient had experienced fever three days before, with a peak body temperature of 38.5 °C. No other discomfort was described. He had visited other hospitals before and was diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection based on haematological findings. However, his condition did not improve after treatment with intravenous levofloxacin. Within a half a day, he developed impaired memory, concomitant with speech disturbance, poor response, no significant limb movements and convulsions before being referred to the emergency department of our hospital. The patient had no medical history. No histories of food and drug allergies were obtained. The patient denied any prior history of smoking, heavy drinking or drug abuse. On arrival, the initial physical examination revealed the following: body temperature 38.0 °C, pulse 100 beats/min, respirations 26 breaths/min, blood pressure 144/76 mmHg, delirium, speech disturbance, equal size and round shape of bilateral pupils with diameters of approximately 3.0 mm, sensitive to light reflex, basically normal cranial nerve examination, limb muscle strength Grade V, negative bilateral pathological signs, and no ataxia. The patient’s neck was soft, and there were no signs of meningeal irritation. No significant findings were found on the cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations. No skin rashes or bleeding sites were observed after examining the entire body. The laboratory test results were the following: haematology: white blood cells (WBC), 12.5 × 109/L, neutrophil percentage, 87.6%; C-reactive protein (CRP), 56 mg/L; procalcitonin (PCT), 2.8 ng/mL; and D-dimer, 3.2 μg/mL. A chemistry panel and screens for infectious diseases and cardiac markers were generally normal. No abnormal findings were observed on chest X-ray or electrocardiogram. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed a curved high-density mass at the left sylvian fissure area and an ischemic lesion of the left temporal lobe (Fig. ).
As an emergency diagnosis, massive cerebral infarction (probable atherosclerosis of the left internal carotid artery system) was considered, and intracranial infection could not be excluded; appropriate treatments included aspirin for anti-platelet aggregation, atorvastatin for lipid regulation and plaque stabilization, and cefuroxime and acyclovir for anti-infection.
The patient experienced aggravated unconsciousness after two hours of admission, and physical examination showed the following: lethargy, aphasia, equal size and round shape of bilateral pupils with diameters of approximately 3.0 mm, sensitive to light reflex, shallow right nasolabial folds, immobilization of right limbs upon orbital pressure, movable left limbs, positive right pathological signs and negative left pathological signs. Further revascularization therapy was considered, and the patient was immediately transferred to undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). On the way to the radiology department, the patient experienced further aggravation of unconsciousness and entered a light coma, concomitant with limb seizure, gazing to the left of bilateral eyes, equal size and round shape of bilateral pupils with diameters of approximately 2.0 mm, and disappearance of the light reflex. Appropriate treatments included midazolam for epilepsy, mannitol for dehydration and intracranial hypotension. After termination of the seizure, re-examination of the brain CT showed a curved high-density mass at the left sylvian fissure area and a massive low-density area in the left temporal lobe with many high-density plot areas scattered within it. CT images also showed compressed deformation of the left ventricle and a shift of the brain midline to the right (Fig. ). Considering that the patient developed haemorrhagic transformation, he was admitted to the emergency intensive care unit for further management.
Eighteen hours after admission, the patient experienced further aggravation of unconsciousness and entered a moderate coma, concomitant with high fever (body temperature 39.9 °C), bilateral pupils: left versus right = 5.0 mm versus 3.0 mm, respectively, disappearance of the light reflex, increased muscle tone of the right limbs, and positive pathological signs of bilateral limbs. The brain CT re-examination showed expansion of the bleeding area, with overt signs of brain herniation. The patient underwent emergency left frontal temporal craniotomy, removal of the intracranial hematoma and a decompressed craniotomy performed by neurosurgeons. The intraoperative findings were as follows: dark red appearance of the left temporal brain tissue, concomitant with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH); an ostomy of approximately 0.2 cm was created along the left temporal sulcus; a visible purple blood clot was observed, concomitant with surrounding contused brain tissues; and a large vascular embolization could be observed in the hematoma cavity. Approximately 10 mL of the hematoma and contused brain tissues were removed and sampled for pathological evaluation. Histopathological examination showed haemorrhage, oedema and inflammatory changes in brain tissues, neutrophil infiltration into the vascular walls and surrounding tissues, and microvascular purulent thrombosis (Figs. –). The patient was transferred to the neurologic intensive care unit for further treatment after the operation. During the course of the treatment, negative findings were found for Chlamydia pneumoniae, mycopsslasma, influenza, tuberculosis, the TORCH panel, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); the sputum culture was negative, and the blood culture suggested Staphylococcus aureus. No abnormal findings were found on chest X-ray or ultrasound. In addition, two transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) examinations were normal, and there were no observations of valvular dysfunction or neoplasm. The following final diagnosis was considered: massive cerebral infarction, consistent with haemorrhagic transformation (the left internal carotid artery system, inflammatory thrombus), Staphylococcus aureus sepsis and symptomatic epilepsy. After two months of vancomycin anti-infective treatments and supportive and symptomatic treatment, the consciousness of the patient improved gradually, and several blood cultures were negative. He underwent rehabilitation and was discharged from the hospital on the 72nd postoperative day (POD). At discharge, his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was E4V4M6, and the modified Rankin scale score was 3.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 60-year-old male experienced dimmed vision in his left eye for 3 days prior to his first visit. The patient negated any other symptoms, including pain and diplopia. He had a history of two previous occurrences of possible ON – 30 years ago in his left eye and some 10 years later in his right eye. The patient had a history of hypertension and was currently on antihypertensive drugs. No relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) was present at his first examination. BCVA was 0.65 in the right eye and 0.5 in his left eye. A fundus examination revealed an atrophic and excavated disc in his right eye. An optic disc edema was present in his left eye. Retina was normal in both eyes. Laboratory tests for sarcoidosis, syphilis, and giant cell arteritis were analyzed, including determination of HGB, blood count, serum calcium, ESR, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), and Wassermann reaction (WR). All tests were normal or negative. Visual field and color vision were analyzed 3 days later; visual field test showed arcuate inferior defects in both eyes, with equivalent neural capacity of 67% in his right eye and 58% in his left eye. A Sahlgren’s saturation test (SST) color vision test revealed a more defective color vision in his left (20) than in his right (15) eye.
An orbital MRI carried out 1 week later revealed increased signal intensity in the parts of the left optical nerve sheath, possibly indicating OPN. The MRI also showed increased signaling in the retrobulbar fat of the left eye. No increased swelling of the extraocular muscles was evident.
The patient received a course of prednisone, 60 mg/day, which was tapered over 1 month, at which time he was examined again. BCVA was 1.0 in the right eye and 0.65 in his left eye. The optic disc edema had subsided substantially since the last fundus examination 1 month earlier. He received a new course of prednisone, starting with 25 mg/day, which was tapered to 7.5 mg/day until his next visit 2 months later. His BCVA was 1.0 in his right eye and 0.65 in his left eye.
Visual field testing again showed arcuate inferior defects in both eyes and abnormal thresholds, with equivalent neural capacity of 69% in his right eye and 61% in his left eye. A new MRI showed a slight regression of the enhancement around the left optical nerve since the last MRI. The results of a fundus examination revealed a pale papilla in both eyes. He remained on 7.5 mg/day prednisone, which was tapered over 14 weeks. At a new consultation 4 months later, BCVA was 1.0 in the right eye and 0.5 in his left eye.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"The proband (II-2 in Fig. ) is a 45-year old woman, who first presented to our university hospital at the age of 35 and was referred to us because of her pregnancy. She has congenital deafness, first experienced syncope at the age of 3, and was diagnosed with epilepsy. She was treated with anti-epilepsy medications; however, she subsequently experienced several instances of syncope. At the age of 13, she had a syncope event, and was suspected of having JLNS because of her congenital deafness and prolonged QT interval. Her syncope was diagnosed as an arrhythmic episode when she was aware of tachycardia and as epilepsy when she was not. She also had a subarachnoid hemorrhage at the age of 29.
When she first presented at our hospital, she was not taking beta-blockers, because of a history of asthma, but was taking mexiletine in addition to phenytoin. Her QTc was found to be prolonged (584 ms) at presentation and administration of atenolol was initiated. She delivered her baby (III-1 in Fig. ) through Caesarean operation at our hospital at the age of 35. At 37, she delivered her second baby (III-2 in Fig. ) through Caesarean operation at our hospital. Despite administration of beta-blockers, her QTc remained prolonged (600 msec at the age of 37, 780 msec at 44) (Figs. and ), which is not unexpected because treatment with beta-blockers in LQTS1 is not expected to overtly reduce QTc []. However, she continued to experience occasional syncope and finally underwent an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) operation at 38 years of age. Subsequently, she is in a stable clinical condition. Because the proband was suspected of JLNS and both infants had a measured QTc of 500 ms or greater within 1 month after birth, beta blockers were initiated and both children remain in stable condition at ages 10 and 8 (Figs. and ). QTc of the son (III-1 in Fig. ) was measured as 500 ms one month after birth, while the QTc of his sister (III-2) was 530 ms at birth.
The father (I-1) and mother (I-2) of the proband were first cousins. There is no history of sudden unexplained syncope or death of children or adults in the immediate family members, despite the prolonged QTc of the children.
Clinical evaluation and consultation of the proband and her family members were performed at Chiba University Hospital. Clinical phenotypes were deduced from the clinical history, physical examinations, and ECG. Blood samples were collected from the proband and her family members following genetic counseling, and written informed consent was obtained prior to sample collection.
Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes according to established protocols at our laboratory []. Entire coding exons, including the intronic boundaries of the genes, of KCNQ1 (NCBI ref: NM_000218) and other LQT causative genes (KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNJ2, SCN4B, KCNJ5) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), according to established protocols in our laboratory. Briefly, 30–100 ng of genomic DNA was subjected to PCR amplification with DNA polymerase (PrimeSTAR GXL DNA Polymerase; Takara Bio Inc., Kusatsu, Japan) and primer sets.
The amplicons were subjected to conventional sequencing with Sanger sequencers (Applied Biosystems 3730/3130 DNA analyzers; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The sequence data were processed with Gene Codes Sequencher Software (Takara Bio Inc.) and mapped to the human genome sequence (build GRCh37/hg19).
Genetic analysis was performed to screen all coding exons and the exon–intron boundaries of the KCNQ1 gene (NCBI ref: NM_000218.2, NP_000209.2) with concurrent screening of other LQT causative genes (KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNJ2, SCN4B, KCNJ5). We detected a novel homozygous nonsense variant, NM_000218.2:c.115G > T (p.Glu39X, in exon 1a), in the KCNQ1 gene of the proband, as well as a homozygous common variant (NM_000218.2:c.1343C > G, p.Pro448Arg) (Additional file : Table S1). Genetic screening of her mother (I-2) and children (III-1 and III-2) revealed that they were heterozygous for the nonsense variant (Fig. ). Her husband (II-3) was also screened and found to be heterozygous for the common variant (NM_000218.2:c.1343C > G, p.Pro448Arg). The proband is a child from a first-cousin marriage, and we have concluded the homozygous nonsense variant in the proband is the cause of her JLNS1. The proband was negative for pathogenic variants in other LQT causative genes, including the KCNE1 gene (Additional file : Table S1).","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"The patient was a previously healthy 73-year-old female who underwent curative resection for GBC (pT2N0M0 according to the eighth International union against cancer TNM classification). We performed next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based genomic profiling of the resected specimen using the NGS gene panel, Oncomine® Comprehensive Assay version 3 (OCA v.3, Thermo Fisher Scientific), which revealed ERBB2 Ser310Phe (c.929C>T; VAF, 18%) and TP53 Ser241Tyr (c.722C>A; VAF, 19%) mutations. One year later, a hepatic lesion was observed on follow-up imaging and she underwent surgical total biopsy for a pathological diagnosis.
A patient had no symptoms and was in good health at the time of total biopsy.
The patient had no previous medical history.
The patient’s physical examination was not remarkable and laboratory testing was within normal limits, including tumor markers, such as CA19-9 and CEA.
Contrasted computed tomography (CT) showed an ill-defined low attenuation lesion in the posterior lobe of the liver (Figure ).
The hepatic lesion was histologically diagnosed as well-differentiated adenocarcinoma and the histological findings of the hepatic lesion were similar to those of GBC (Figure ). Therefore, the lesion was considered a metastasis. Moreover, we performed genomic profiling from the liver tumor using the NGS panel, Oncomine® Target Test system (OTT, Thermo Fisher Scientific). This revealed ERBB2 Ser310Phe (c.929C>T; VAF, 26%), which was identical to the mutation detected in the sequencing result of the primary site; thus, the liver tumor was the most consistent with a metastasis of GBC rather than localized ICC. To evaluate HER2 overexpression in tumor cells, we performed immunohistochemistry of HER2, which was negative (HER2 score 0). Since TP53 was not included in the gene list of OTTs, TP53 mutation status at the metastatic site was not assessed.
The final diagnosis of the presented case is hepatic recurrence of GBC.
After the total biopsy of liver metastasis, she was treated with two standard chemotherapy regimens, namely gemcitabine and cisplatin, and TS-1; however, her disease did not obtain clinical benefit from these treatments. After six months from hepatic resection, she was confirmed to have a progressive disease during second-line chemotherapy. At that time, she had liver and pulmonary recurrence, as well as pulmonary and inferior vena cava tumor embolism, which caused tachycardia and peripheral edema.
Considering no standard treatment beyond second-line for GBC, we treated the patient with lapatinib with a combination of capecitabine (lapatinib at a dose of 1250 mg per day continuously plus capecitabine at a dose of 2000 mg per square meter of body-surface area on days 1 through 14 of a 21 d cycle) based on the accumulating preclinical and clinical evidence that tumors with ERBB2 mutation benefit from HER2-targeted treatment.
Within a week of treatment, she experienced major subjective clinical improvement, which included resolution of peripheral edema. After 2 cycles of treatment, contrasted CT imaging showed a decrease in the size of tumor emboli and hepatic lesions (Figure ). However, after 4 cycles of treatment, the patient discontinued treatment due to grade 3 mucositis. Mucositis was gradually subsided over two weeks after discontinuation of the treatment. One month after discontinuation, her disease progressed, and she chose best supportive care.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 46-year-old postmenopausal woman was admitted to our ED with complaints of massive abdominal distention which started gradually 30 days ago. She also complained of difficulty in breathing and ambulation. There were no other gastrointestinal, gynecological, or urinary symptoms. The woman had a significant past medical history of hypertension. Her family history is negative for ovarian and breast cancer in first-degree relatives. On physical examination, the patient’s abdomen was distended. Blood analysis revealed hemoglobin of 13.9 g/dL, 8280 leukocytes, and 226 000 platelets. All tumor markers were within normal limits. However, the ovarian cancer antigen (CA 125) level was 260.9 U/mL (normal range: 0–35 U/mL). Abdominal and pelvis MRI was performed, which revealed a huge pelvic-abdominal mass measuring approximately 22 x 15 x 12 cm (). As there was a strong suspicion of malignancy, the patient underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The enormous lobulated tumor weighing 6.7 kg had a thick wall with solid and cystic areas (). Her final histopathology report was suggestive of uterine leiomyoma. The patient had no intra-operative or postoperative complications. On day 5 after the surgery, the patient was discharged home. Three months following the surgery, the CA 125 levels had regressed to the normal range. The patient has since been symptom-free, and the CA 125 levels have also remained normal.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"Patient three was a 25-month old male with unilateral RB when he experienced choroidal infarction in the treated eye. His infarction was diagnosed at the one-month follow-up appointment after his second dose of OAC with melphalan and carboplatin. He was heterozygous for two polymorphisms: C677T and A1298C. While he did not receive nitrous oxide during his first OAC session, he did receive 58 min of nitrous oxide with max ET N2O 31.9% during this second session of OAC.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 64-year-old woman experienced gradual visual loss for several months prior to her first examination. The woman had a 15-year history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In addition, she suffered from hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sleep apnea, and a sense of unsteadiness, which had worsened during the last months. She was on several medications (aspirin, omeprazole, simvastatin, atenolol, ramipril, amlodipine, albuterol inhalation, budenoside, and formoterol inhalation). She negated eye pain. BCVA was 0.8 in both eyes. Both visual fields exhibited temporal defects (Humphrey field test). A fundus examination showed peripapillary atrophy in both eyes, but no sign of edema. An MRI with and without intravenous contrast performed 1 week later revealed an increased volume of fluid surrounding both optical nerves as well as increased signal intensity in the optical nerve sheaths, as seen in OPN. The MRI also showed increased signaling in the retrobulbar fat of the left eye and possible subcortical vasculitis. At a consultation, 1 week after the first visit, BCVA was unchanged since the last visit. Laboratory testing was done for sarcoidosis (ACE), syphilis (WR, VDRL), and neuromyelitis optica (NMO). In addition, ESR, CRP, HGB, and blood count were determined. Results showed a high or abnormal ESR, serum lysozyme, polyclonal IgG, and creatinine. Results for NMO antibodies, syphilis, and sarcoidosis markers were normal or negative. A chest X-ray did not find any sign of sarcoidosis. However, a slightly enlarged heart was observed, suggesting a developing heart failure. The woman was later administered intravenous corticosteroids (1 g ×2) and cyclophosphamide to treat her SLE. Shortly after, the woman was hospitalized due to cardiac arrhythmia. Warfarin and digoxin were prescribed, and the woman was discharged from the hospital some days later. Because of her arrhythmia, future treatment with corticosteroids was restricted.
At a new examination 3 months after her first visit, BCVA was unchanged. Results from eye field tests were still abnormal, with no certain change since the last examination. An SST color vision test showed more defective color vision in the left eye (80 p), compared to the right (30 p). Fundus examination showed no optic disc edema in either eye.
At a new consultation 2 months later, BCVA was still unchanged at 0.8 in both eyes. She was on prednisone (5mg/day) in addition to methotrexate (5 mg/week) and levetiracetam, which had been prescribed since her last visit. A fundus examination revealed peripapillary atrophy, but no signs of disc edema in either the left or the right eye. Visual field tests were abnormal (Humphrey field test, VFI was 61% in right eye and 71% in left eye). One month later, she was given injections of rituximab.
At the final eye examination 10 months after her first visit, BCVA was 0.8/0.65. A slight improvement of visual test results was observed (Humphrey field test, VFI was 83% in right eye and 74% in left eye). As noted previously, color vision was more defective in the left eye (35 p) compared to the right (20 p), although some improvement was seen since the last examination.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"The first patient was a 45-year-old woman who presented with abdominal pain, weight loss, and diarrhea. She underwent a colonoscopy in October 2014, which revealed a 3-cm tumor in her cecum. A right colectomy was performed in January 2015, and a well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma of 2.5 × 1.5 × 1.5 cm invading into the muscularis propria was identified. No perineural or lymphovascular invasion was observed, but a mild tumor inflammatory infiltrate was present. Margins were free, and metastasis to one of 24 lymph nodes was documented. Ileal schistosomiasis was found in the specimen. MSI was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (loss of MLH1 and PMS2). All RAS mutations were negative. She received 6-month adjuvant capecitabine- and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Last follow-up visit was on June 13, 2016.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 35-year-old woman presented with five days of nightly accentuated burning pain in both legs leading to massive sleep disturbance. The pain was predominantly located in the dorsal thighs and radiated to the calves. She reported some relief through walking around at night and showering her legs with hot water. Back pain, gait or sensory disturbances and bladder dysfunction were denied. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs did not alleviate pain, neither did pramipexole, which had been prescribed for suspected restless leg syndrome. One week before she had had a sore throat and had been clinically diagnosed for streptococcal tonsillitis and treated empirically with penicillin. Her past medical and family history was unremarkable. Clinical examination revealed no focal-neurologic signs. There were no sensory deficits and deep tendon reflexes were symmetrically normoactive. Furthermore, we found no palpable lymph node swelling and no signs of pharyngitis. Motor and sensory nerve conduction studies were normal, as were F-responses of the tibial nerve. Abdominal Ultrasound demonstrated a slightly enlarged spleen. Blood sampling showed relative lymphocytosis, and elevated liver enzymes. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed 18 white blood cells/μl (90% lymphocytes, 10% monocytes), 83mg/dl protein, and blood–brain-barrier dysfunction (albumin CSF/serum quotient 12.5 × 10-3) without intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis. Virological studies detected EBV VCA IgG and IgM in serum, whereas EBV EBNA-1 IgG was negative. Moreover, EBV-PCR (RealStar® EBV PCR Kit 1.0, altona Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) was positive in blood and CSF (1000 copies/ml each) suggesting primary EBV infection involving the nervous system. Further laboratory investigations were not indicative for infections with streptococcus, borrelia, syphilis, HIV, hepatitis virus A, B or C (serological tests in blood, borrelia and syphilis additionally in CSF), VZV, HSV or enteroviruses (VZV- and HSV-IgG-specificity-indices and PCR in CSF). Under initially started empiric therapy with intravenous acyclovir for possible VZV or HSV radiculitis and analgesic treatment with oral tramadol the patient completely recovered within a few days. After receiving negative results for VZV and HSV, acyclovir was ceased on day six.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 28-year-old male was transferred to our hospital in November 2006 because of a sudden onset of cramping and abdominal pain and intermittent melena for 4 days. Initially, he exhibited symptoms including generalized weakness, dizziness, and massive bloody stool passage. There was no significant past medical history of recent infection, inflammatory bowel disease, bleeding disorders, changes in bowel habits, significant weight loss, or tuberous sclerosis complex. The patient had no previous surgeries, and the family history was unremarkable. The patient's height was 180.2 cm, weight was 78.5 kg, blood pressure was 74/39 mm Hg, pulse rate was 122 beats/min, and temperature was 36.4°C. The physical examination revealed moderate distention and tenderness in the left lower quadrant with associated defense. On digital rectal examination, there was some gross blood mixed with soft stool and an empty ampulla. Laboratory data showed a white blood cell count of 17,120/mm3, hemoglobin level of 7.4 g/dL, hematocrit of 23.9%, and platelet count of 162,000/mm3. Other biochemical tests were normal. The serum carcinoembryonic antigen level was normal.
The gastroscopic evaluation was normal. The full colonoscopy revealed a greater than 4.0 cm in diameter, large ulceration with an easy bleeding mass of the rectum lying beneath the mucosa but protruding into the lumen 15 cm from the anal verge (Fig. ). This tumor could not be classified by biopsy. However, on the basis of the immunohistopathological features, carcinoma and malignant lymphoma could be excluded. An abdominal enhanced CT scan revealed a heterogeneous mass lesion of approximately 8.9 x 7.2 cm in the pelvic floor at approximately the level of the rectum (Fig. ). A technetium-99m red blood cell scan showed no significant findings. Repeated attempts at endoscopic revaluation resulted in profuse bleeding requiring blood transfusions. A diagnostic biopsy failed before the surgical treatment due to bleeding from a light touch of the mass lesion
Given the difficulty of obtaining a diagnostic specimen, surgical resection and lower anterior resection were performed. On gross examination, the resected specimen was an 8.8 x 5.5 x 4.5 cm, tan, gray-white, soft, and well-circumscribed transmural mass of the rectum, mainly involving the muscularis propria and protruding into the tunica adventitia. The mucosa and submucosa were intact (Fig. ). The tumor protruded into the lumen, and the overlying mucosa showed ulceration. The tumor had a dark, red-grey, solid parenchyma with irregular cystic spaces with colorless serous liquid (Fig. ). The cut surface showed a yellowish-tan to gray-red solid parenchyma with focal irregular cystic spaces containing colorless serous fluid (Fig. ). All surgical margins were macroscopically free of tumor. No separate polyps were identified. Microscopically, the foci of hemorrhage and necrosis were present. The tumor extended through the muscularis propria into the subserosa tissue with lymphatic invasion. The colon mucosal tissue was composed of sheets with atypical glands with spindle-to-epithelioid cells and nuclear abnormalities in a tubular arrangement (Fig. ). Perivascular hyalinization was noted (Fig. ). Most tumor nuclei showed clear to granular, light, eosinophilic cytoplasm, and round to oval nuclei with distant small nucleoli pleomorphism (Fig. ). Less than 50% of the tumor area was necrotic. The mitotic rate was low. One of 27 accompanying serosal lymph nodes contained metastatic tumors that distended the subcapsular sinus. All of the surgical margins were free of tumor. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for melanoma-associated antigen (HMB-45) (Fig. ) but negative for cytokeratin, c-kit, synaptophysin, S-100, and actin. A diagnosis of metastatic PEComa was made after examination of the resection material.
Unfortunately, the patient did not complete the follow-up in the outpatient department after surgery because he relocated to another city to seek work. At the 49th month (2010) postoperatively, the patient returned to the clinic upon our scheduled request. An abdominal CT scan showed a 0.6 cm hypodense mass over the liver. He refused further evaluation and treatment. In July 2014, during the course of a required physical health check, he received an abdominal CT that showed that the original mass had increased from 0.6 to 1.5 cm and that the number of tumors had increased from 1 to 3 compared with the previous CT image in 2010. We noted that the distant liver metastasis progressed very slowly during the 4 years of follow-up. The liver function and the other serum tumor markers were normal upon examination. In August 2014, he underwent segmental hepatectomy (S3, S4A, S5, and S6) combined with wedge resection. The pathology report of segmental hepatectomy was metastatic PEComa.
This patient underwent 2 different surgical resections at 2 different times. He underwent the lower anterior resection of the PEComa of the rectum in 2006 and received the segmental hepatectomy in 2014. He is currently undergoing regular surveillance and has remained free of disease 28 months after the second operation. At the follow-up examination, the patient felt well, and the general clinical examination, subsequent colonoscopies, and abdominal CT scan once every 3 months revealed no significant findings after second operation in 2014. Since the primary surgery in 2006, there was also no recurrence of the PEComa of the rectum according to the general clinical examination, subsequent colonoscopies, and abdominal CT scan at the 120-month follow-up of the very first instance back in 2006.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 20-year-old female patient visited the clinic due to eczematous lesions on the posterior neck, flexure area of the elbow, and popliteal area with known atopic dermatitis. She also suffered from atopic dermatitis from infancy. She received a standard treatment also without effectiveness, showing persistent fluctuation. Her clinical severity scores were improved from 32.9 to 5 after 24 Histobulin injections. The laboratory test results and skin test results before and after treatment are shown in Figure . The MAST results showed that 7 allergens were positive (Dp 100<, Df 100<, shrimp 0.61, Cladosporum hertiarum 1.34, A fumigatus 2.65, A alternata 1.88, and mugwort 4.41) before treatment and 12 allergens were positive (Dp 100<, Df 100<, crab 0.41, shrimp 0., C herbarum 8.89, A fumigatus 5.10, Alternaria alternata 14.19, mugwort 1.13, P notatum 44.23, oxeye daisy 0.74, dandelion 0.57, and goldenrod 0.62) after treatment. In the skin test, 10 allergens (Dp 4+, Df 4+, grey Alder with silver birch 2+, mugwort 4+, short ragweed 2+, black willow pollen 2+, Japanese cedar 2+, milk mix 2+, almond 2+, and peanut 2+) showed a positive reaction before treatment and 7 allergens (C albicans 2+, Dp 4+, Df 4+, mugwort 4+, black willow pollen 3+, Japanese cedar 1+, and peanut 2+) after treatment.

"A 69-year-old man was referred to our clinic in August, 2006 presenting with decreased visual acuity in his right eye. He had been diagnosed with CIMF in July, 2000 and continued to have supportive care for CIMF throughout his follow-up. He had no specific ocular history and no history of irradiation. Visual acuities were 20/25 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left. Slit lamp examination showed no abnormalities on the conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber and iris. Fundus examination disclosed a mild vitreous hemorrhage in the right eye (). The peripheral fundi of both eyes showed marked vessel occlusion and microaneurysms in the temporal area. Fluorescein angiography in both eyes showed arteriovenous anastomosis with a marked area of nonperfusion and multiple sea-fan neovascularization on both eyes (). On laboratory examination, hemoglobin was 4.9 g/dL, platelet count was 63,000/mm3, and white blood cell count was 2,500/mm3 (with no blast cells). A peripheral blood smear test showed teardrop-shaped red cells. His fasting blood sugar value was normal, and the hemoglobin electrophoresis study was negative. Bone marrow examination showed hypocellular marrow with severe fibrosis and osteosclerosis (cellularity 11-20%), and no Philadelphia chromosome or BCR/ABL gene rearrangement was found.
In view of these findings, photocoagulation of the peripheral avascular retina of the left eye and laser photocoagulation with pars plana vitrectomy of the right eye were performed. Intraoperative findings were mild vitreous hemorrhage with a diffuse traction membrane around the temporal avascular retina. The vitreous hemorrhage and traction membrane were removed and laser photocoagulation was performed. Four weeks after surgery, his visual acuities were 20/25 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left, fundus examination of the right eye revealed no vitreous hemorrhage, and the retinal neovascularization had regressed in both eyes with good laser scars ().","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 15-month-old male, with a past medical history significant for microcornea, was admitted to our hospital with progressive peripheral edema for two weeks. Parents reported 4-5 explosive diarrheal bowel movements per day for approximately 4 weeks prior to presentation. The bowel movements were described as yellow-green in color, with associated “little globules,” liquid to pasty in consistency without blood or mucus. Shortly before admission, he began vomiting after almost every meal. On physical exam he was ill-appearing, afebrile, with significant facial and upper and lower limb edema. Laboratory investigations revealed the following: white blood cells, 14.5/mm3; C-reactive protein, <0.03 mg/dL; total protein, 3.6 g/dL; plasma albumin, 2.4 mg/dL; no abnormalities in liver, renal, and thyroid function tests; normal results of urinalysis and no proteinuria. Immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase, Epstein-Barr virus profile, and Cytomegalovirus profile were all negative. Stool for bacterial and viral cultures, Giardia antigen, white cells, and blood occult were also negative. Stool for alpha-1 antitrypsin was elevated at >1.33 mg/g (normal <0.62 mg/g), consistent with protein losing enteropathy. Upper endoscopy showed edematous antral and duodenal mucosa. The rectal and sigmoid mucosa appeared normal on flexible sigmoidoscopy. Biopsies from the colon and rectal mucosa showed patchy increased subepithelial bands of collagen of variable thicknesses consistent with collagenous colitis. The collagen deposition was highlighted with Masson trichrome staining (). The gastric biopsy contained chronic gastritis with increased fibrosis and collagen deposition but no clear subepithelial collagen band (). The duodenal biopsy showed foci of possible increased collagen in the mucosa, but not enough to be diagnostic for duodenal involvement of collagenous mucosal inflammatory disease (). Budesonide was then initiated at 3 mg per day for 5 days but he continued with diarrhea and protein loss requiring parenteral nutrition replacement. Intravenous methylprednisolone was then added at 2 mg/kg/day and a marked improvement in his symptoms was noticed. He gradually tolerated oral intake and was weaned off total parenteral nutrition over a one-week period. He was discharged home on prednisolone 1 mg/kg/dose in addition to 3 mg per day of budesonide. He continued to do well after weaning off prednisone over two months. An attempt to discontinue budesonide led to worsening diarrhea and a requirement for reinduction for remission with oral steroid along with budesonide. He was then maintained on 3 mg of budesonide per day and continued to do well clinically. Upper endoscopy and colonoscopy were repeated 5 months later and showed persistent collagenous colitis without gastric or duodenal involvement. Biopsies at endoscopy and colonoscopy one year after presentation were normal on maintenance budesonide. He continued to do clinically well thereafter with no GI symptoms.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 52-year-old female presented with a sudden onset of right-sided numbness and weakness that was accompanied by a left temporal cluster-like headache. No fever or prodromal infection was found at disease onset.
The family and personal history was unremarkable.
On physical examination, the height and weight of the patient were 154 cm and 56 kg, respectively. Vital signs were normal, as were heart, lung and abdominal exami-nations. Neurological examination showed intact mental status, with normal speech and comprehension. Mild 4/5 right-sided hemiparesis was present with normal tone in both the arm and leg, though no other focal neurological deficits were found. After admission, she complained of discomfort and tingling in the right leg, after which a generalized tonic-clonic seizure for 3 min occurred before it was stopped by a bolus of intravenous diazepam.
Laboratory tests, including D-dimer, lactic acid, and serum autoantibody levels, as well as thyroid function and tumor markers indicated no apparent abnormalities. Glucose tolerance and lactic acid movement tolerance tests were normal. A lumbar puncture was performed, and her open intracranial pressure was 180 mm H2O. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing showed that cell counts and protein, glucose, chloride, monoclonal antibody, adenosine deaminase, and lactate dehydrogenas levels were within normal ranges.
MRI demonstrated a lamellar left parietal lobe lesion predominantly involving the cortex, with hyperintensity on both diffusion-weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (Figure ). The apparent diffusion coefficient map revealed a preserved, isointense signal. No abnormalities were found by susceptibility weighted imaging or magnetic resonance angiography and venography (Figure ). Due to the stroke-like onset pattern and MRI features, further thrombophilia screening was performed and showed decreased protein S activity. A diagnosis of cortical venous thrombosis was first proposed. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) was also considered but temporarily excluded because of the incomplete manifestation and lack of genetic evidence. Anticoagulation therapy was initiated, and follow-up was performed to maintain the international normalized ratio (INR) within the target range.
Two months later, the patient was readmitted for subacute cognitive impairment. She was unable to identify and communicate with family members; she also had difficulty understanding questions or instructions and instead responded by repeating the word ""nothing"". During hospitalization, a secondary generalized seizure occurred, initially with eyes gazing to the right and then convulsion developing, which lasted for approximately 10 s before self-alleviation. Neurological examination suggested transcortical sensory aphasia, with fully covered limb strength. Blood tests and CSF examination were normal; INR was 2.21. On repeated MRI, new lesions were identified in the left temporal lobe and were also detected 10 days later in the right temporal lobe on radiological follow-up (Figures and ). Although the MRI signal characteristics are consistent with the initial findings, the original lesion in the left parietal lobe had been alleviated, with cortical atrophy. We further conducted magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), which revealed markedly elevated lactate (Lac) concentrations in the regions of interest in the left temporal lesion (Figure ). Mitochondrial encephalopathy was diagnosed, and genetic testing using peripheral blood was performed. However, DNA testing for frequent MELAS and myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers syndrome mutations were negative. Because of the lack of symptoms of muscle weakness or pain, the patient declined our suggestion of performing a muscle biopsy. Anticoagulation therapy was terminated, and levetiracetam (1000 mg/d) was administered.
At 3 mo after her second admission, the patient was experiencing involuntary movement in her left limbs, with repetitive flexion/extension. An MRI scan showed a hyperintense signal abnormality in the right parietal lobe (Figure ). Brachial biceps biopsy was performed. Histopathology revealed no abnormalities, and no necrotic or regenerating fibers were observed; ragged-red fibers and intense succinate dehydrogenase activity were not detected. Nonetheless, complete sequencing of mitochondrial DNA samples extracted from the biopsied muscle revealed a heteroplasmic m.10158T>C mutation, with a heteroplasmy level of 69.6%, in the mitochondrial complex I subunit gene MT-ND3. In contrast, this mutation was not found in her peripheral blood cells.
The diagnosis was MELAS syndrome harboring the m.10158T>C mutation.
We administered levetiracetam (1000 mg/d) and oxcarbazepine (400 mg/d) to control epilepsy. Q10 and L-arginine were also administered.
Over the next 6 mo, the present patient did not manifest any further stroke-like episodes.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"Thirty-five year old unmarried male, known positive for HIV infection and on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) since 2001, presented with genital ulcers for a prolonged duration of 16 months. He gave past history of recurrent genital ulcers which were responded to acyclovir. He had undergone circumcision because of recurrent herpes ulcers in 2005. He was initiated on NNRTI containing ART (AZT + 3TC+NVP) in 2001. His CD4 cell count improved in the years 2002–2006 and subsequently in late 2006 he had a decline in CD4 to 140. He underwent genotyping and found to have NRTI and NNRTI mutations. He was switched to boosted indinavir-containing second line HAART regimen in late 2006. His CD4 count improved to 290, 354, 405 and 398 cells/microliter in the follow-up visits. In spite of his improvement in CD4 he developed genital ulcers in 2007 [], which were not responding to the usual line of management with acyclovir and antibiotics. The imprint cytology and scrapings from the lesions showed degenerated and mature squamous cells in an inflammatory background and the patient did not give consent for biopsy. Since the patient was known to have recurrent herpes genitalis, and was responding to acyclovir in the past, we diagnosed it as HSV and his VDRL was non-reactive on four repeated attempts. Dark-field examination for Treponema pallidum was negative on repeated attempts. He was on acyclovir and antibacterial for a prolonged period with some improvement on the genital lesions but genital lesions did not heal fully. In July 2008, to avoid indinavir toxicity he was substituted with boosted atazanavir containing PI regimen. His genital lesions healed completely [] in 15 days with no recurrence for more than two months and his current CD4 count is 437 cells/microliter.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"The patient, a 26-year-old male, with a history of acid injury in the right eye 3 months prior had been variously treated with symblepharon release, hAM transplantation, and BCL insertion in the acute phase followed by lid reconstruction, symblepharon release, and an Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) for uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP). At presentation, he had a total LSCD with total conjunctivalization of the cornea []. There were symblephara of the upper and lower lids [Fig. and ]. Vision was perception of light with inaccurate projection of rays. Digital tension was higher than normal. The left, unaffected eye was within normal limits with a healthy limbus. B-scan ultrasound of the affected eye revealed an attached retina. The technique of SLET used was as described by Sangwan et al.[] – blunt dissection of the pannus from the corneal surface, release of all symblephara, gluing of an hAM (non-cryopreserved, fresh), and fixation of limbal explants from the contralateral eye with fibrin glue (Tisseel Kit from Baxter AG, Vienna, Austria). At the end of the procedure, a BCL was placed. Tissue harvested from the healthy eye was approximately 2 mm wide and was divided into 11 bits which were placed in two concentric circles on the right eye []. shows the slitlamp photograph of the operated eye on post-operative day 2.
The patient was followed up daily for the first 6 days and subsequently on days 8, 10, and 14. At each visit, besides a full clinical evaluation, slit lamp photographs were taken and anterior segment OCT was done on a Cirrus™ HD-OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Goeschwitzer Strasse 51–52, 07745 Jena, Germany), spectral-domain OCT with an axial resolution of 5 μm and a transverse resolution of 15 μm.
For the purpose of the study, three explants were identified on a clinical photograph [] and labelled as 1, 2, and 3. Serial OCT was done along a radial axis for each explant reaching up to the limbus, as shown in by a single investigator (MS) at each follow up day on each of the three explants. Quality of all OCT images achieved was satisfactory. The best images were obtained for explant 2 and are reproduced here.
Postoperative regime followed was prednisolone acetate drops 6 times a day, moxifloxacin drops 6 times a day, and carboxy-methyl cellulose drops 2 hourly. The BCL was retained in the operated eye for the entire duration of the study.
There was rapid resolution of conjunctival congestion and good mobility of the globe with release of the symblephara. Lid closure was good. Digital IOP was normal. Anterior chamber details could be made out hazily through the translucent cornea, with the pannus removed. Vision remained perception of light with inaccurate projection of rays. The donor fellow eye had rapid closure of the epithelial defect at the donor site.
The hAM remained of even density (OCT reflectivity) and thickness throughout the study duration []. Sub-hAM space increased from day 3 and resolved completely by day 10. There was thinning of the explants from day 3 which corresponded to the sub-hAM space expansion, which may have been compressing the explants against the BCL. Fibrin around the explants started decreasing from day 2 onwards and disappeared by day 4. The hAm, even though glued to the corneal surface with fibrin glue, was not absolutely stable in the early days after SLET. The fibrin glue beneath the hAM appeared to swell, displacing the hAM anteriorly. However, this settled by day 10, and thereafter the hAM was adherent to the cornea. There were no changes in the consistency (reflectivity) and thickness of the hAM. The fibrin around the explants developed optically hollow spaces immediately adjacent the explants and started decreasing from day 2 and disappeared by day 4. Comment regarding the thinning rate of the explants is difficult as it is impossible to ensure that the OCT section is being taken at exactly the same site of the explants on each occasion. Further, the thinning of the explants appear to correlate with the initial bulging of the sub-hAM space and continued even as the hAM settled down and adhered to the cornea. There was no evidence of epithelialization up to day 8. By day 14, there was complete epithelialization on the limbal side, in contrast centripetally directed epithelialization was poor extending only about 0.24 mm on day 14. The nature of the epithelium was boggy and not the crisp reflective layer that is seen in OCT of normal corneas. There was little change in the corneal stromal thickness and lucidity on OCT.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 40-year old male patient of Moroccan origin was admitted in 2012 for diffuse lymphadenopathy confirmed with ultrasound. Blood tests revealed renal insufficiency (serum creatinine: 1.6 mg/dL, eGFR: 48 ml/min/1.73 m2), low serum C3 and C4 levels and hypergammaglobulinemia (4250 mg/dL with oligoclonal banding). Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) were positive at 1/640. Anti-dsDNA were negative. Urine tests showed proteinuria (444 mg/L). A thoraco-abdominal computed tomography and positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) were performed. The images were compatible with a lymphoproliferative disorder. Heterogeneous uptake was also noticed in kidneys. Lymph node biopsy was performed and ruled out a hematologic malignancy. Immunohistochemistry showed more than 10 IgG4+ plasma cells per high powered field (HPF) of biopsy sample with more than 40% of IgG+ plasma cells being IgG4+ (Fig. ). Serum IgG4 level was then measured at 2790 mg/dL (N < 201 mg/dL).
This episode was not the first in patient’s medical history. In 2004, the patient had been admitted for lower-limb edemas and diffuse lymphadenopathy. Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine: 3.51 mg/dL, eGFR: 24 ml/min/1.73 m2), low serum C3 and C4 levels and hypergammaglobulinemia (4590 mg/dL) had already been found. Urine tests showed high proteinuria (13800 mg/l) with hypoalbuminemia characteristic of a nephrotic syndrome. Renal ultrasound showed diffuse kidney enlargement. PET/CT showed the same results as the one performed in 2012. A lymphoproliferative disorder was excluded by whole skeleton X-Ray, bone marrow and lymph node biopsy. A renal biopsy was then performed and showed membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) with IgG and C3d deposits (Fig. ). Severe tubulo-interstitial nephropathy (TIN) with lymphoplasmocytic infiltrate (CD20+, CD3+, CD5+) was associated. Secondary causes of MGN were rejected by appropriate tests. ANA were negative at the time. The proposed diagnosis was a dysimmune state of unknown origin with secondary MGN and reactive lymphadenopathy. Treatment with glucocorticoids (GC) was started with an excellent clinical and biological response.
In 2005, a cutaneous rash appeared on the left arm and was biopsied, showing IgG and C3d deposits. GC were stopped in 2006 given the recovery of renal function. A few months later, the patient started to complain of pain, redness and swelling in small joints of the feet and hands.
In 2008, the first relapse occurred with the same clinical picture that in 2004 (nephrotic syndrome and lymphadenopathy). Full assessment was repeated yielding similar results except for renal biopsy: MGN with IgG and C3d deposits was found again but chronic interstitial nephropathy replaced the severe TIN. Indeed, a mononuclear infiltrate was present in the interstitium without clear sign of tubular involvement. A severe thrombocytopenia (platelets: 8.103/mm3) developed a few weeks later with anti-dsDNA found on blood sample (1/80). Thrombocytopenia was refractory to perfusion of immunoglobulins, GC and cyclophosphamide (CYP). Plasmapheresis and splenectomy were then performed. CYP was next continued for 6 cycles (500 mg/cycle) with good efficacy. Relapsing thrombocytopenia was successfully treated by additional regiments of immunoglobulins and GC. The last cycle of CYP was completed at the end of 2008. Thereafter, the patient experienced a long period without any problem until the next hospitalization in 2012.
In 2012, a renal biopsy was not performed again despite a new relapse of nephrotic syndrome; indeed, the 2008 biopsy had led to a macroscopic urinary hemorrhage which had required embolization. MGN was assessed again and anti-phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) antibodies were negative. Diagnosis of IgG4-RD was finally made on the basis of the lymph node biopsy, with IgG4-related generalized lymphadenopathy and IgG4-related MGN (associated with IgG4-related TIN in 2004). The patient was given GC again at high dose (methylprednisolone 96 mg daily) for 1 month followed by a progressive decrease of the dose. Rituximab use was discussed in 2013, due to a new relapse in spite of maintenance low dose GC therapy and development of side effects; unfortunately, the patient failed to obtain the reimbursement and the medication could not be given in this context. For now, the patient is well stabilized with low dose GC. Rituximab in compassionate use could be reconsidered in case of a new relapse. Figure shows the evolution of various biological markers and serum creatinine during 2013.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 30 years old male patient presented to the hospital with a 2-day history of high-grade fever and headache. Headache was diffuse, moderate to severe in intensity, associated with pain and stiffness in neck, photophobia and vomiting. Condition was not associated with blurring of vision, double vision, vomiting, loss of consciousness or convulsions. There was no history of sore throat, cough, ear pain, ear discharge, motor weakness, sensory weakness, hearing difficulty, altered level of consciousness, abnormal jerky movements or skin rashes. Patient also reported persistent colorless discharge from nose and postnasal drip for 4 months. There was no history of ear fullness, persistent headache or head trauma. Patient was non-smoker and there was no history of alcohol use.
6 weeks ago, patient was discharged from hospital after being treated as bacterial meningitis. The CSF examination for viral PCR and bacterial gram stain/culture was negative. He was treated with a 14-day course of intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone. He had complete recovery of symptoms without any neurological sequalae. During hospital stay at that time, he underwent MRI head which showed large bony defect in the sellar floor with soft tissue in the anterior aspect of the sella with infrasellar extension into the left sphenoid sinus ). Neurosurgery and otorhinolaryngology teams were consulted, and an elective endoscopic endonasal/open repair of the skull base defect was planned as outpatient after resolution of meningitis. Patient still had persistent rhinorrhea during this presentation as he did not undergo repair of bony defect of sellar floor.
Physical examination revealed a young adult well oriented to time, place and person. He was febrile with temperature of 38.9 degrees Celsius. Pulse, blood pressure and respiratory rate was normal. There were no skin rashes or scratch marks. GCS was 15/15. He had normal cranial nerves, motor and sensory examination. Neck stiffness, Kernig’s and Brudzinski’s signs were positive. Cardiovascular, chest and abdominal examination was normal.
Complete blood count revealed neutrophilic leukocytosis with raised C reactive protein. Urea, creatinine, electrolytes and liver function tests were normal. Lumbar puncture was performed and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed high white blood cell count with predominance of neutrophils, high protein and low glucose (). Viral PCR of CSF was negative. CSF culture showed gram negative coccobacilli () identified as Pasteurella multocida sensitive to ceftriaxone, ampicillin and penicillin. Blood cultures were negative. After confirmation of the organism, a retrospective history of contact with dogs, cats or other animals was taken which revealed that he often used to feed stray cats who lived around his house. However, there was no history of cat scratches, bites, licks or kisses on any part of the body. Patient was treated with IV ceftriaxone 2 g twice a day for 14 days with complete resolution of his symptoms. He was offered surgical correction of his skull defect, but he preferred to do it in his home country. He was discharged with advice to avoid contact with dogs and cats till surgical correction of bony defect of skull.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A variant SN was found during the routine dissection of a male Caucasian cadaver aged 72-years-old at death. The right SN was split by the PM into two roots, a superior CFN part and an inferior TN part (). The superior root was found to pierce the piriformis and the inferior root traveled inferior to the inferior border of the piriformis (infrapiriformis foramen). Distal (approximately 3 cm) to the piriformis, the CFN and TN were united by a communicating branch (Cb) descending superomedial to inferolateral in an oblique manner. The Cb was approximately 1 cm in width by 3 cm in length. Distal to this Cb, the CFN and TN continued toward the popliteal fossa and were distributed in normal fashion to the anterior/lateral and posterior compartments of the leg, respectively. No atrophy or other pathology was noted in any muscles of the leg and no other anatomical variations of the left or right lower limbs (including gluteal region) were noted.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 68-year-old male was diagnosed with severe HEMA in early childhood, with less than 0.001% factor VIII activity. The brother of the proband also suffered from severe HEMA, thus the mother must have been carrier of the causative mutation. The children of the proband were male, and consequently, in this part of the family the mutation has not been passed on. Due to the distant past of the diagnosis, no genetic tests had been performed to identify the causative mutation. Around 30% of patients with severe HEMA develop inhibitors during their treatment with factor VIII, especially patients with large deletions and intron inversions. Thus, genetic factors can influence inhibitor development, and different treatment approaches are chosen according to risk of inhibitor development []. However, the proband never developed factor VIII inhibitors, possibly suggesting a smaller and less frequent mutation in F8 than the large intron inversion. Following blood transfusion, the proband was tested positive for HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus in the late 1980s and early 1990s, respectively. The patient was cured for his Hepatitis C infection, but never received any treatment for his HIV-1 infection, since he remained with normal CD4 T cell count over time and was considered an HIV long-term non-progressor (LTNP).
To identify the HEMA causative mutation (as well as possible mutations explanatory for his HIV LTNP phenotype), a blood sample was drawn in EDTA tubes (FLUKA), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated over ficoll gradient (GE-healthcare). Integrating HIV DNA in CD4 T cells might result in false positive (somatic mosaic) mutations, or disturb the quality of sequencing. Therefore, CD4 T cells were depleted by magnetic purification (miltenyi biotec). DNA from non-CD4 T cells was purified using allprep DNA/RNA mini kit (Qiagen). Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed employing Kapa HTP Library preparation and Nimblegen SeqCap EZ MedExome Plus kit and analysed using Nextseq v2 chemistry (2 × 150 bp). SNPs were called relative to hg19. Variant call files (VCF) were uploaded to Ingenuity Variant Analysis (IVA, Qiagen) and variants were compared to population frequencies of variants in the Allele Frequency Community (AFC) database and to frequencies in the 1000 Geneomes project. One hundred thirty thousand six hundred eighty-seven variants were identified in 16,957 genes in the patient, of which seven were located in the F8 gene. Two variants did not pass quality control, thus five variants could be possibly causative (see Table ). Four of the remaining variants had an allele frequency much higher than the disease frequency and were therefore judged as being irrelevant. Therefore, one variant (c.5411_5412delTCT, p.F1804del) remained a potential cause of disease (Fig. ). The mutation was verified in the raw BAM file (Additional file : Figure S1). Ingenuity did not provide any dbSNP ID or frequency for this variant, which is thus denoted as novel. Moreover, the variant was not reported in Coagulation Factor Variant Databases EAHAD.CFDB (), which provides all 5418 known transcript variants in the F8 gene, confirming that the c.5411_5413delTCT, p.F1804del must indeed be novel.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 68-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital with chest pain for 6 months and lower limb fatigue for 1 month. There had been no obvious cause for the onset of back pain 6 months ago. This pain was particularly evident at night and had become more severe and accompanied by lower limb fatigue 1 month previously. He had received no anti-TB therapy before admission. X-rays, MRI and CT of spine, routine blood tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations and hepatorenal function were examined. He had a white blood cell count was 5.7 × 109/L, ESR 87 mm/1h, CRP concentration 21.4 mg/L and normal hepatorenal function.
The patient consented to publication of data concerning his case.
Physical examination showed hypesthesia below the rib arch, Grade 1 lower limb muscle strength and Frankel Grade C neurological function. It also showed increased muscular tone in the lower limbs, knee and ankle hyperreflexia and positive sign for ankle clonus.
X-ray films showed collapse of the T8 vertebrae and T7–8 intervertebral space. CT scan showed destruction of T7, T8 and the intervertebral space and sequestrum formation, especially on the left side. A paravertebral abscess was limited to T7 and T8 without an obvious gravitation abscess. The height of the T8 vertebral body was markedly reduced and the dural sac and spinal cord severely compressed by an abscess posterior to the vertebral body.
The patient was administered the anti-TB drugs isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide prior surgery. He underwent surgical debridement, interbody fusion and internal fixation via a posterior approach 7 days after starting anti-TB therapy because his paralysis progressively worsened after commencing chemotherapy. He continued to receive anti-TB chemotherapy for 18 months postoperatively.
The patient was placed in a prone position under general anesthesia with somatosensory-evoked potential monitoring. Extraperiosteal dissection at both non-fusion and fusion levels was performed through a midline incision. The posterior spinal construction was exposed, including the spinous processes, lamina, facet joints and transverse processes and the range of exposure at the level of decompression expanded to include the costotransverse articulations and 3–5 cm of the medial ribs bilaterally. Pedicle screws or hooks were placed at one or two levels superior and inferior to the level of decompression under C-arm fluoroscopy guidance.
One side rod was fixed temporarily to avoid spinal cord injury during decompression and focal debridement. Lesion debridement to drain the prevertebral abscess and expose the diseased vertebral bodies was performed from the side with more bone destruction and a larger abscess (left). The facet joint was resected unilaterally and the lower costotransverse joints excised with a small fragment of adjoining rib if in the thoracic segment, retaining contralateral structural integrity (Figs , ), while protecting the spinal cord and nerve root. Spatulas of various sizes and angles were used from a posterior approach to remove all lesions, including sequestra, abscesses and granulation tissues. The abscesses were drained by suction and curettage as thoroughly as possible.
After distracting the intervertebral space, specially constructed titanium mesh cages or bone blocks were implanted into the interbody (Fig. ). Both ends of the titanium mesh cages were filled with autologous bone with allograft or autogenous bone in the middle. Both side rods were then fixed and both sides compressed to tighten the mesh cages and bone blocks. After completion of internal fixation, debridement and interbody thoracic fusion were performed, and strip-sized autogenous or allograft bone imbedded in the posterior body to fuse the segments that had been subjected to decompression and focal debridement. Streptomycin (1.0 g) and isoniazid (0.3 g) were deposited locally. The debrided material underwent bacterial culture and histopathologic examination.
Antibiotics were given i.v. injection during the first postoperative week. The drainage tube was removed when the drainage volume was less than 20 mL/24 h. The patient was asked to wear a brace as soon as possible and then for at least for 6 months. The patient received anti-TB chemotherapy with the four drugs mentioned above for at least 9 months and isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol treatment for another 3–6 months thereafter.
The patient was examined clinically and radiologically 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery and then at yearly intervals. X-rays and blood tests were examined. Bone graft fusion was assessed using Bridwell's radiologic criteria. The patient had significant improvement in back pain after surgery and had achieved bony spinal fusion 6 months after surgery. His ESR and CRP had recovered to normal values by 3 months postoperatively.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 67-year-old male presented to the outpatient clinic with a chief complaint of ambulatory difficulty and a history of an ankle fracture and deformity. The patient's daughter reported that her father sustained an ankle fracture 6 weeks ago and was hospitalized. The history revealed that the patient was placed in a short-leg cast and surgery was considered but not performed since the ankle mortise was reduced at that time and the patient's ankle displayed multiple fracture blisters. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility during which time the cast was removed secondary to non-compliance and skin compromise. The patient's daughter stated that her father was fully ambulatory at 2 weeks after the initial injury despite medical advice. Unfortunately, he was unaware of his ankle fracture since he suffered from dementia and Alzheimer's disease. His medical history was also significant for poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, prior alcohol abuse, seizures, aortic stenosis, meningioma, and hypertension. A physical examination revealed a well-nourished individual who was in no acute distress and was alert but not oriented to time, person, or place. His vital signs were stable. The left lower extremity was edematous with a non-infected necrotic wound over the medial malleolus. The ankle and rearfoot displayed severe valgus deformity with the medial malleolus causing pressure necrosis to the overlying soft tissue. He had weakly palpable pulses and loss of protective sensation when examined with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament. Radiographic evaluation revealed a displaced fibula fracture with significant ankle joint subluxation and widening of the medial clear space (). The patient was admitted to the hospital and stratified as moderate risk for surgical intervention after optimized by both internal medicine and cardiology.
Non-invasive vascular studies that consisted of ankle-brachial index, toe-brachial index, and pulse volume recordings demonstrated moderate arterial occlusive disease with a falsely elevated ankle-brachial index secondary to calcified vessels. The patient was then evaluated by vascular surgery and after angiography was performed, adequate collateral circulation was present and their recommendation was to proceed with appropriate surgical intervention. The patient was brought to the operating room after obtaining informed consent from his daughter, as he was deemed not competent to make his own medical decisions. The patient underwent operative intervention that consisted of ORIF of his fibula fracture with placement of multiple pro-syndesmotic screws and application of a multi-plane circular external fixator. Postoperatively, the patient was permitted to fully weight-bear with the external fixator and discharged to a rehabilitation facility. The patient developed a postoperative infection that was evident 3 weeks after surgery, as wound dehiscence and drainage were apparent. The patient was readmitted to the hospital for inpatient care. The patient was brought back to the operating theater during this admission for an incision and drainage of the ankle wound with collection of deep intra-operative soft tissue cultures and reclosure of the wound over a drain. The drain was removed at 72 h and then wet to dry dressings were applied daily until the wound was healed. Deep intra-operative cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The patient was initially placed on parenteral administration of Vancomycin but was switched to oral administration of Zyvox after the first week as the patient continued to remove his peripherally inserted central catheter line. His antibiotic regimen was continued 6 weeks for treatment of deep infection with retained hardware. The patient healed his wound at 6 weeks postoperatively and was full weight-bearing with the external fixator for 12 weeks total time.
The external fixator was removed and the patient was placed into a walking total contact cast for a total of 6 weeks with cast changes performed at 2 week intervals. The patient was able to resume full ambulatory status with prefabricated extra-depth diabetic shoes with soft inlays at 18 weeks postoperatively. The patient continued to maintain an ambulatory status with no further complications at his 8-month follow-up ().","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 59-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with locally advanced lung adenocarcinoma. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a tumor in the right upper lobe that had invaded the middle lobe and S6 segment, as well as hilar lymphadenopathy (#12u and #11 s) without mediastinal lymph node swelling (cT2aN1M0). An ESL procedure (right upper, middle lobectomies and S6 segmentectomy) that preserves the basal segment with a double-sleeve technique was considered in order to avoid a right pneumonectomy in this patient. Since successful ex situ auto-transplantation after a pneumonectomy for locally advanced lung cancer has been reported [, ], the Dokkyo Medical University Hospital Ethics Committee approved our protocol (#26030) for an operation including a back-table procedure and auto-lung transplantation after a pneumonectomy for locally advanced lung cancer to examine its merits. Such an auto-lung-transplantation protocol was performed in the present case for curative resection and basal-segment preservation. Consent to participate and to publish this study was obtained from the patient before surgery.
We initially performed a 5th intercostal posterolateral thoracotomy. After administration of intravenous heparin and prostaglandin E1, the pulmonary artery and vein were clamped, and the right pneumonectomy was completed. For a venous anastomosis between the lower pulmonary vein of the graft and upper pulmonary vein of the body, the pulmonary veins were dissected as distal as possible for the upper pulmonary vein and proximal as possible as for the lower pulmonary vein (Fig. ). Following completion of the pneumonectomy, the excised lung was irrigated with a cold low-potassium phosphate-buffered dextran glucose solution (EP-TU solution; Cell Science & Technology Institute, Sendai, Japan) to protect the lung graft from ischemia-reperfusion injury during preparation of the graft of the basal segment as a back-table procedure. At the same time, another surgeon performed a mediastinal lymph node dissection to shorten the operation time. Thereafter, basal segment auto-transplantation was performed in the order of bronchus, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary vein anastomosis. Finally, the basal pulmonary vein of the graft was anastomosed to the upper pulmonary vein orifice. The operation time was 359 min and blood loss was 305 g.
The postoperative course was uneventful and no ischemia-reperfusion injury was observed, and the patient was discharged from the intensive care unit 1 day after the operation. The pathological diagnosis was pT2aN2M0 adenocarcinoma. Following surgery, the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel. At 9 months after the operation, she had returned to normal life without recurrence of the primary disease.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"The second patient was a 45-year-old recently diagnosed patient of chronic kidney disease. An ultrasonography controlled renal biopsy was performed. Immediately after the biopsy, the patient complained of significant flank pain with hypotension. An urgent CT scan was performed that showed a large left perirenal and retroperitoneal hematoma with bleeding from the left lumbar artery []. Transfemoral aortography and renal angiography confirmed the renal vessels to be normal. Active bleeding was documented from the second left lumbar artery. He was also managed by an emergency transcatheter angioembolization of the lumbar artery using gelatin foam (Gelfoam, Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI, USA). Postembolization, the hematoma stabilized, pain reduced, and blood pressure stabilized. At 3-month follow-up, ultrasonography showed a small residual hematoma.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission. Exclusion Criteria: Individuals under 18 years of age, COVID-19 infection, Infection of the skin at the CGM site requiring removal of the sensor, Patients with altered Mental Status, Patients unable to scan their flash CGMs at least every 8 hours, Inability to provide written consent, Hospitalized for less than 24 hours.",1
"A 42-year-old male, presented with a complaint of numbness over the left foot for 5–6 months. On examination, the power of the left ankle was 3/5, left extensor hallucis longus was 3/5, and 50% loss of sensation of touch, pain, and temperature at L3–L5 dermatome. Sphincter involvement was absent. History of previous spine surgery or lumbar puncture was absent. MRI spine revealed intramedullary lesion in the conus at D12–L1. Lesion was hyperintense with areas of isointense on T1-weighted image and heterogenous on T2 weighted image []. The patient was operated with D12–L1 laminectomy. The dura was opened in the midline and intramedullary cystic lesion was found at the conus. Posterior midline myelotomy was performed followed by evacuation of yellowish pultaceous material. The cyst wall was firmly adhered to the neural tissue of conus medullaris and could not be excised to prevent injury to neural tissue. The cyst was evacuated and the epithelial lining of the cyst wall was electrocoagulated although not extensively to prevent any new deficit, based on previous experience. On histopathology, the cyst was lined by stratified squamous epithelium and underlying fibro collagenous tissue showed hemorrhage and lymphomononuclear infiltrate []. All these features were characteristic of intramedullary white EC. Immediately after the surgery, the patient recovered completely with no new deficit. On 5 months, follow-up patient developed numbness with recurrence of the cyst at the same site. The patient was advised to repeat surgery, which he refused.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"The patient was a 51-yr-old woman with swelling of the extremities and bilateral ptosis on March 8, 2010. She complained of exertional dyspnea and weakness. She married at the age of 25. After that time, she developed drooping of her eyes, with the left eye drooping more than the right eye. Her symptoms persisted and they had gradually increased during about the last 10 yr. About 8 yr ago, she underwent a ptosis repair operation at a local clinic, but her symptoms were not improved. She denied a history of loss of consciousness, headache, dysphagia, dysarthria and myalgia. There was no family history of similar symptoms and no history of trauma. There was no previous history of diabetes and hypertension.
On examination, she was determined to be 151 cm in height and 48 kg in weight. The initial vital signs were a blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg, a pulse rate of 68 beats/min and a respiratory rate of 20/min. She was lethargic and had facial puffiness and no goiter. The lung and heart examinations were unremarkable. All the extremities showed pitting. She had marked bilateral ptosis, while the external ocular movements were normal (). The other cranial nerve examinations were unremarkable.
The laboratory findings were a total leucocyte count 4.75 × 103/µL with 61.6% polymorphs, a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, the random blood glucose was 124 mg/dL, the serum sodium was 130 mM/L, the potassium was 3.7 mM/L, the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 13 mg/dL, the creatinine was 0.8 mg/dL, the aspartate transaminase (AST) was 81 IU/L, the alanine transaminase (ALT) was 29 IU/L, the total bilirubin was 0.93 mg/dL, the creatine kinase (CK) was 1,195 IU/L (normal reference: 20-180 IU/L ), the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 517 IU/L (normal reference: 101-218 IU/L), the total cholesterol was 256 mg/dL, the triglyceride was 121 mg/dL, the high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was 40 mg/dL and the low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was 196 mg/dL. The urinary analysis was negative for blood and protein with using a dipstick. As the clinical findings suggested hypothyroidism and myasthenia gravis, a thyroid function test and acetylcholine receptor binding antibody test were done. The serum T3 was 0.195 ng/mL (normal reference: 0.86-2.02 ng/mL), the free T4 was 0.08 ng/dL (normal reference: 0.93-1.705 ng/dL), the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 2.08 µIU/mL (normal reference: 0.27-4.2 µIU/mL), the antimicrosomal antibody was 17 IU/mL (normal reference: 0-34 IU/mL), the antithyroglobulin antibody was 20.1 IU/mL (normal reference: 0-114 IU/mL) and the acetylcholine receptor binding antibody was negative.
Secondary hypothyroidism was suspected. We performed a careful history taking and other pituitary hormone evaluations. At the age of 26 the patient delivered her daughter and she had a history of massive postpartum vaginal bleeding. Thereafter she not resumed menses. The basal levels of other hormones were a serum cortisol of 4.03 µg/dL, the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was 29.64 pg/mL, the growth hormone (GH) was 0.06 ng/mL, the IGF-1 was 25 ng/mL (normal reference: 71-263 ng/mL), the prolactin was 1.59 ng/mL, the luteinizing hormone (LH) was 1.49 IU/L, the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was 4.91 IU/L, the E2 was 17.29 pg/mL and the testosterone was 0.02 ng/mL. The combined pituitary stimulation test, including the insulin tolerance test, the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation test and the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test showed panhypopituitarism (). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a finding of an empty sella turcica and there was no evidence of an intracranial mass, hemorrhage and aneurysm ().
Nerve conduction study (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) of the limbs reveled normal results with the exception of incidentally detected carpal tunnel syndrome. Needle EMG of the orbicularis oculi showed no evidence of dysfunction of the neuromuscular junction.
We diagnosed her as having Sheehan's syndrome, bilateral ptosis and subclinical myopathy caused by secondary hypothyroidism. Replacement with prednisolone of 10 mg/day and thyroxine (T4) 100 µg/day was started. The dose of prednisolone was decreased to 5 mg/day after 4 weeks. At 3 months follow-up, she had become euthyroid with normalized muscle enzymes. She recovered from her presenting symptoms and the bilateral ptosis was much improved ().","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A sixty-four-year-old female patient applied to our hospital with the complaints of abdominal swelling, vomiting, and constipation which had been continuing for three days. Her history revealed TAH+BSO+pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection due to endometrium cancer a month ago. Clinical examination showed only abdominal distension. No feature was observed in plain abdominal X-ray and abdominal CT examinations. Laboratory parameters were normal (Figures and ). Exploratory laparotomy was decided for the patient. Advanced level adhesion was observed in the abdomen during laparotomy. The small bowels, colon, stomach, and liver were adhered and surrounded en bloc by a fibrous capsule in a way that anatomic boundaries could not be distinguished (Figures and ). No area was found appropriate for adhesiolysis or resection in this ACS patient. Percutaneous gastrostomy (PG) was applied to the patient with palliative purposes because of her continuous vomiting and lack of oral food intake. Abdominal fascia was extremely rigid and was not suitable for closing. The skin was closed with primary suture. The patient became ex on the 25th postoperative day.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 66-year-old woman with no prior cardiac history was admitted for primary percutaneous intervention with intermittent atypical chest pain radiating to the jaw for 1 day, and ST elevation on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Her past medical history included surgical removal of superficial melanoma of the thorax and left shoulder in 2008 and 2016, without evidence of metastasis. She suffered from impaired memory since 5 years, and probable CAA was diagnosed 2 months prior to the myocardial infarction. There were no other cardiac risk factors present at admission. Physical examination was without abnormalities.
Sinus rhythm was observed on the admission ECG, with normal heart axis, narrow QRS (120 ms) with ST elevation in leads V2 through V6. No conduction disturbances were present ().
A significant rise-and-fall of serum troponin was measured with a peak of 131 ng/L (cTnl (Cardiac-specific Troponin I) n < 14 ng/L). Other laboratory results were unremarkable with normal liver and renal function.
Radial approach coronary angiography was performed and the culprit vessel was shown to be the left anterior descending artery of the left coronary artery with a 100% obstruction in the distal segment. Two 2.5–16 mm drug eluting stents were placed with restoration of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction 2 flow (). Other coronary vessels were non-obstructed. Echocardiography with microbubbles (Optison™) injection revealed an LV function of 35% with hypokinesia of the anterior wall with akinesia of apical segments and aneurysm formation, without LV thrombi present (, Video Appendix).
Patient received medical treatment with aspirin, clopidogrel, a statin, a betablocker, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor initially. During outpatient follow-up, LV function remained stable at 35%. An LV mass was detected after 6 months ().
The neurologist was consulted regarding this complication and its therapeutic consequences. A conjoined decision was made by the cardiologist and neurologist to discontinue aspirin and clopidogrel and start apixaban twice daily 5 mg, based on its efficacy- and safety profile in CAA patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) as well as multidisciplinary consensus. Despite stable cardiac function, she suffered from an ischaemic stroke 1 year later, the LV thrombus considered being the cause.
With no new ICH or hemosiderosis present on repeat brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), apixaban was discontinued and phenprocoumon [vitamin K antagonist (VKA)] was started. During follow-up, no complications or adverse events were reported.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"Case 1: A 66-year-old woman presented with chronic bloody nasal discharge, sero-mucous otitis and acute arthritis of the right elbow. With the onset of episcleritis and the finding of cANCA-PR3, a diagnosis of GPA was made. The patient was treated with prednisone and cyclophosphamide, subsequently replaced by mycophenolate mofetil because of hemorrhagic cystitis. The evolution was favorable. Due to weight loss of 10 kg a thoraco-abdominal CT was performed 10 years later revealing hyperdense spontaneous thickening with enhancement around the ascending and horizontal aorta. In addition pulmonary opacity of the right lower lobe was detected and a diagnosis of mononeuropathy with falling foot was made. A PET-CT showed hypermetabolism (SUV max 8.1) at the aortic arch and the ascending aorta. cANCA-PR3 were present at all times. In this context, immunosuppression by corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil was intensified. PET-CT scanning 18 months later showed a clear decrease in hypercaptation.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 47-year-old Chinese man presented to our department of ophthalmology with a 26-month history of left upper eyelid painless swelling and redness. The patient was initially treated with a course of intravenous penicillin, which resulted in temporary regression of the lesion. There had been no similar family history of this appearance to date.
Physical examination revealed that the left lacrimal gland was obviously swelling, which presented with a soft, non-tender and smooth-surfaced. Slit lamp examination was otherwise unremarkable aside from bilateral mild cataract. Laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 9.8 × 10-9/L with 15.91% eosinophils(normal range: 0.05-0.5 × 10-9/L). Serum concentration of immunoglobulin E was elevated at 469.3 IU/ml, and immunoglobulin G4 was 295 mg/dL (normal range less than 135 mg/dL). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination of the orbit showed that the left lacrimal gland was lobulated with a distinct margin and was predominantly isointense on T1-weighted images. Isointense on T2-weighted images and an obvious heterogeneous enhancement on contrast-enhanced MRI images are shown in Figure . The chest radiograph was normal and no cervical lymph nodes were palpable.Next, we advised the patient to be hospitalized and the patient underwent an orbital biopsy. Intraoperative frozen sections were reported as being consistent with a benign tumor. Therefore, a complete resection was undertaken. Perioperatively, it was noted that the mass had a smooth and homogeneous grey appearance. There was no evidence of haemorrhage or cystic change and borders were indistinct. A definite diagnosis of KD was made by histopathology and immunohistochemical examinations of representative resected specimens after surgery. Histopathological examination demonstrated follicular hyperplasia with evidence of reactive germinal centres. Eosinophilic infiltration, involving the interfollicular areas, and proliferation of post capillary venules were observed. These features enabled a diagnosis of KD to be made (Figure A). Further analysis, including immuohistochemistry, was undertaken, demonstrating positive staining for CK, Vimentin, CD3, CD4, CD20, CD21, CD117, CD5, CD8, CD23, IgG and IgG4 (30 per high-power field) and negative staining for CD10 and CD34 (Figure B), the ratio of IgG4 to IgG positive cells was about 35%. The pathological diagnosis, which was also the final diagnosis, was KD. However, some ophthalmologists questioned whether the histological and immunohistochemical findings were also had common features with IgG4-related disease, which is a newly recognized fibro-inflammatory condition characterized by tumefactive lesions, a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate rich in IgG4-positive plasma cells, storiform fibrosis, and elevated serum IgG4 concentrations.
The patient was discharged following his surgery and treated with prednisone 25 mg/day for four weeks and then reduce by 5 mg/day every two weeks. His symptoms gradually improved. Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels dropped to 125.9 IU/mL and eosinophil’s decreased to 0.69 × 109/L after 2 months. There was no sign of recurrence in twelve months of regular follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 36-year old nulliparous female patient presented to our emergency department with acute lower abdominal pain, general discomfort, and elevated inflammatory markers. Her past medical history included obesity with a body-mass-index of 40, superficial vein thrombosis of the upper extremity and achilles tendon rupture. No bleeding abnormalities were reported. Cervical cancer screening including PAP smear was regularly performed and inconspicuous, most recently less than one year ago. On physical examination the patient presented significant rebound tenderness and involuntary guarding of the lower abdomen with a positive Blumberg sign. Speculum examination showed normal external female genitalia, normal vaginal epithelium, no abnormal discharge and a non-suspicious cervix. Significant cervical motion tenderness was observed during vaginal palpation. On vaginal ultrasound, the anteverted and anteflexed uterus showed no suspicious lesions. Bilateral adnexal masses with both cystic and solid aspects, remarkable hyperperfusion as well as free intraabdominal fluid were noted (Fig. a, b), suspicious for tubo-ovarian abscesses. During emergency laparoscopy, ruptured ovarian tumors with up to 8 cm sized cauliflower-like masses comprised of small cysts foremost of the right, but also of the left ovary were detected (Fig. a, b) and an enucleation of the cystic structures was performed.
On histopathological examination, a neoplasm with adeno-papillary growth of the inner female genital tract was described and the diagnosis of an eBOT with microinvasion of up to 1 mm was established. Following thorough postoperative discussion of the treatment options and their clinical impact, the patient decided against a fertility preserving approach favoring radical surgery including hysterectomy. Subsequently, laparoscopic staging was performed with hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, infracolic omentectomy and extensive peritoneal staging. In final histopathological results, an unexpected, HPV-high risk associated, intracervical endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the cervix uteri with a transversal diameter of 12 mm was diagnosed so that this was attributed as the primary tumor with ovarian metastases (Fig. a-f). Consistent with HPV high-risk association, the tumor showed strong immunohistochemical expression of p16 in the ovary and in the endocervix. CT scan of the thorax and abdomen showed no other distant metastases so that a subsequent laparoscopic lymph node staging was carried out to excluded tumor-infiltrated pelvic or para-aortic lymph nodes. Accordingly, final histopathological assessment led to a tumor stage of pT1b1 with ovarian metastases, pN0, L0, V0, Pn0, G2, R0, FIGO IB1. As individual decision making, an extended adjuvant treatment was applied consisting of chemoradiation followed by chemotherapy with four cycles paclitaxel and carboplatin according to the protocol of the currently recruiting OUTBACK trial (NCT01414608).","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 53-year-old, non-smoker, male patient came to our ambulatory and subsequently admitted in our Respiratory Intensive Care Unit for severe dyspnea associated with severe non-hypercapnic hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 ratio 120; PaCO2 28.5 mmHg, pH 7.485). He had a history of chronic kidney failure due to type I membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis. As the hypoxemia was refractory to high-flow oxygen-therapy (Reservoir mask with O2 at 15 liters per minute), a trial of non invasive ventilation (NIV) delivered via a full-face mask was attempted (mode Pressure-support, PS = 20 cm H2O; PEEP 8 cm H2O; FiO2 0.80); then, after 20 hours, endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation resulted mandatory due to NIV failure. Chest CT-scan showed a pattern of bilateral alveolar consolidations and ground glass areas suggesting three possible diagnostic hypotheses: Organizing pneumonia (OP), vasculitis, or Goodpasture syndrome [].
A large battery of immunological and microbiological investigations resulted negative. Fibro-bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) and transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) were performed during NIV; the histological exam of the collected tissue showed a pathologic pattern of unspecific neutrophilic capillaritis. As the patient refused to underwent surgical biopsy, the empiric therapy with intravenous pulsed bolus of cyclophosphamide and steroids was given. He died after a worsening of his clinical conditions, radiological findings, and lung gas exchange. The autopsy reported systemic AL amyloidosis with prevalent lung and renal involvement.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"We describe the case of a 60-year-old Caucasian woman with a positive familial history for dyslipidemia and nephropathy.
The patient was first hospitalized in February 2001 with: hypertension (160/100 mmHg), high lipidic values (cholesterol 372 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 267 mg/dl, triglycerides 239 mg/dl), creatininemia within the standard limits (0.9 mg/dl), a corresponding GFR of 63 ml/min calculated according to Cockroft and Gault, albuminemia of 3.15 gr/dl, total proteins of 5.7 g/dl, and a micro-hematuria, proteinuria (200 mg/dl) and proteinuria and/or albuminuria ratio of 2 g/g. The main immunological studies, ASO, rheumatoid factor, C3-C4, VDRL, serum immuno-fixation and serum immunoglobulin were normal. The serum markers for HBV, HCV and HIV were negative. The leucocyte formula was normal.
A physical examination ruled out the presence of xanthelasma and corneal arc in the absence of edemas. An ultrasound revealed kidneys which were regular in dimension and structure.
A renal biopsy showed the presence of lipid deposits in the glomerular lumens under the optical microscope after staining with Red-O oil. The interstitium showed a diffuse fibrous edema and tubular atrophy in the areas of fibrosis with a moderate infiltration of inflammatory cells. An arteriole showed hyaline deposits. An immunofluorescence revealed the presence of deposits of IgM and C3 in the sub endothelial seat. An electronic ultrastructural analysis confirmed the presence of thrombi in the lumen of the glomerular capillary loops. The histopathological diagnosis suspected LPG, but ApoE typing identified the polymorphism (E2/2) with a diagnosis of familial type III dyslipoproteinemia.
The patient started treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg/day. We did not use fibrates in association with statin to avoid possible side effects. After one year of therapy we observed a good control of lipid values (cholesterol 250 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 114 mg/dl) and a reduction of the proteinuria (120 mg/dl). Hypertension was controlled (145/90 mmHg) by means of ACE-inhibitors (irbesartan 300 mg/day, ramipril 5 mg/day), beta-blockers (carvedilole 25 mg/day) and Ca antagonists (nifedipine 60 mg/day).
Four years later in April 2005, the patient was again hospitalized for clinically overt nephrotic syndrome with proteinuria (5 g/24 h) and renal failure (creatinine 2.2 mg/dl). Arterial hypertension (180/100 mmHg) was hardly responsive to treatment. The patient had a low response (cholesterolemia 445 mg/dl, LDL 318 mg/dl, triglycerides 292 mg/dl) to lipid-lowering drugs (atorvastatin 40 mg/day + cholestyramine 4 g/day + Omega3 fatty acids 2 g/day) with the presence of periocular thelasmas.
A renal biopsy revealed the presence of lipids with a fibrous growth of the interstitium and a percentage increase of sclerotic glomeruli with a diagnosis of LPG evolved into nephrotic syndrome (histology will be published in a manuscript in preparation and when published the reference will be provided).
In view of the patient's poor response to pharmacological treatment alone, in July 2005 we decided to associate for the first time in a patient with LPG an LDL-Apheresis protocol (three aphereses in the first two weeks, then one weekly session for two months followed by one apheresis every 15 days) with dextran sulfate columns on the basis of the evidence present in literature for the treatment of the steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. [-]
During the first LDL-apheresis (July 2005) with dextran sulphate columns (Liposorber System - Kaneka™), an anaphylactoid reaction occurred. This complication, as described by Olbricht in 1992 in patients undergoing treatment with ACE inhibitors and an LDL-apheresis regimen with dextran sulphate columns, is due to the inhibition of kininases that metabolize bradikynin [].
To avoid stopping the anti-hypertension treatment with ACE-inhibitors we decided to use another LDL-apheresis procedure: the extracorporeal precipitation of LDL-cholesterol induced by heparin in acid pH (HELP System, B. Braun Avitum™ Melsungen Germany). This procedure does not involve complications linked to the use of ACE-inhibitors, following the same protocol previously described.
The effects of a single HELP-apheresis on vascular homeostasis is a simultaneous, drastic reduction within two hours of cholesterol (-52%), LDL-cholesterol (-56%), VLDL-cholesterol (-52%), oxLDL (-47%), Lp(a) (-55%), triglycerides (-50%), fibrinogen (-56%), thrombin (-55%), von Willebrand factor (-56%), factor V (-57%), factor VII (-35%), PCR (-56%), plasma viscosity (-14%), erythrocyte aggregability (-60%), and thrombocyte aggregability (-60%). Also reported in the long-term treatment was an increase of HDL-cholesterol (+14%), peripheral muscle oxygenation (+33-50%), coronary flow reserve (+14%), and cerebral CO2 reactivity (+14%) [].
In the LDL/fibrinogen apheresis procedure (HELP-apheresis), the plasma is obtained by filtration of the whole blood through a 0.55 μm pore-size filter and then mixed continuously in a 1:1 ratio with a solution of a 0.2 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.85) containing 100 IU/ml (300,000 UI) of heparin. The pH of the plasma-buffer solution reaches 5.12 and, at this value, the heparin binds the LDL-cholesterol, Lp(a), fibrinogen and triglycerides forming aggregates. These aggregates precipitate and are retained by the precipitate filter. Precipitate filter is a 0.4 μm pore-size polycarbonate filter from which plasma free from LDL-cholesterol, Lp(a) and fibrinogen is obtained and then passed through an anion exchange filter (heparin absorber) to adsorb excess heparin. The last stage of the system (dialysis filter) restores the physiological pH of the plasma and the balance of the liquids, removing excess fluid by ultrafiltration. The liquid used for dialysis is a sterile solution with a bicarbonate concentration of 35 mmol/l. After the dialysis process, the plasma, purified of lipids and fibrinogen, is returned to the patient mixed with the haematic cell components.
We processed 3000 ml of plasma. That means about 1.4 patient plasma volumes in two hours, with HELP machine (Plasmat Futura®, B. Braun Avitum, Melsungen Germany) and a disposable kit. There were no side effects with the HELP. method, except that the patient had problematic vascular accesses leading to flow problems, So, it became necessary to modify some software parameters (most notably the ""PA minimum"" threshold; software version 2.06.01) to be able to use a 17G fistula needle for the blood withdrawal and a 20G cannula needle for the blood reinfusion during the procedure. With this configuration, the flows were relatively moderate for an LDL-apheresis (blood flow of 50 ml/min and plasma flow of 20 ml/min), to complete the treatment target of 3000 ml. After some procedures we proceeded with the use of an 18G fistula needle in re-entry, maintaining a 17G fistula needle for drawing, obtaining flows that were definitely higher (blood flow of 80-100 ml/min and plasma flows of 25-30 ml/min). By increasing the flows, there was a marked reduction in the duration of the individual procedure, super-imposable to that of a patient with good vascular accesses.
After two months of treatment with LDL-apheresis (10 procedures), the laboratory data showed a progressive increase of albuminemia (from 3.39 to 3.70 g/dl) with partial remission of proteinuria (from 3.3 to 2 expressed as urine protein to creatinine ratio. A ratio of 0.1 is normal - protein and creatinine are expressed in mg/dl); and a progressive decline in creatininemia (from 1.9 to 1.6 mg/dl). The patient's anemia was improving and her arterial pressure was well under control with a reduction of the pharmacological dose, compared to two months earlier. There was also a significant drop in the mean values of TG (from 285 to 231 mg/dl) and LDL-Cholesterol (from 178 to 158 mg/dl) with reduction of xanthelasma. Pre-apheresis fibrinogen and Lp(a) mean values did not show a significant reduction. Considering the patient's clinical condition improvement, we decided to reduce the statins dosage (from 40 to 20 mg/die) continuing LDL-apheresis protocol of one session every two weeks.
Four months after aphaeretic treatment (15 procedures), the patient's albuminemia values were maintained (3.70 g/dl), her creatinine (1.3 mg/dl) and proteinuria (ratio 1.3) were reduced and her arterial pressure was stabilized (120-80 mmHg). There was a further reduction of LDL-cholesterol (105 mg/dl) and TG (134 mg/dl) mean values, with a suspension of cholestyramine and Omega-3 fatty acids treatment and a further reduction of the xanthelasmas. The LDL-Apheresis session was reduced to one session every three weeks.
After ten months (25 procedures) the laboratory data were as follows: creatinine 1.6 mg/dl, albuminemia 4.30 g/dl, proteinuria (ratio 0.13), LDL-cholesterol 106 mg/dl and TG 154 mg/dl. The values of Lp(a) and fibrinogen are unchanged (Figure , ).
After two years of follow up, with a maintenance treatment of one LDL-apheresis session every three weeks in the last period, the mean biochemical values were: cholesterol 199 mg/dl, LDL-cholesterol 110 mg/dl, HDL-cholesterol 76 mg/dl, TG 112 mg/dl, fibrinogen 381 mg/dl, creatininemia 1.5 mg/dl, Proteinuria ratio 0.9, arterial pressure 120-80 mmHg. The pharmacological therapy is unchanged.
The sequence of the ApoE gene made in 2007 showed that the patient was homozygous for epsilon-2 allele (polymorphism E2/2 with Cys112 and Cys158 in the mature protein) and heterozygous for a novel mutation in exon 4: c.502 C>T [Arg 150>Cys of mature protein]. The mutant Apo E (ApoEMODENA) expresses a new residue of Cys in place of an Arg. This new cysteine residue could form a disulphide bridge with the other Cys residue of the E2 isoform resulting in ApoE polymerization (dominant negative effect). This phenomenon is probably the cause of both dyslipidemia and lipid thrombi in the glomerular capillaries [].","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 39-year-old woman, known case of oesophageal carcinoma, was scheduled for TTE with extended two-field lymphadenectomy with gastric pull-up with cervical neck oesophago-gastric anastomosis and feeding jejunostomy. She had history of hypertension since 4 years and controlled on amlodipine (10 mg) and atenolol (50 mg). She had also received pre-operative radiotherapy. The anaesthetic management and monitoring were as per institutional protocol and was administered epidural and general anaesthesia. As a part of operative procedure, right intercostal drain (ICD) and corrugated neck drain were placed. The intraoperative period was uneventful. She was shifted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for post-operative monitoring and analgesia. Three hours later, she developed respiratory distress and air leak through right ICD. Her oxygen saturation decreased from 97% to 84% over ½ h in spite of oxygen supplementation with Hudson mask. On auscultation, air entry was decreased on the right side and the percussion note was tympanic. She was put on oxygen at 15 L/min through Venturi mask (FiO2 0.60). Subsequent chest radiograph revealed right pneumothorax despite ICD being in situ. Another ICD tube was inserted in the right thorax to relieve pneumothorax. The respiratory distress was only partially relieved and the air leak from the ICD continued. Due to on-going respiratory distress, the patient's trachea was intubated. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy was done to rule out airway injury that was also normal. Hence, we suspected air leak from the cervical drain and it was decided to remove the cervical drain and suture the defect. After removal of the cervical drain, the air leak stopped. Chest X-ray showed inflated lungs and patient had symptomatic improvement. The patient was subsequently extubated and shifted to the ward.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"RF is a 66-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient had a HeartMate II LVAD placed 3 years prior to presentation for medically refractory heart failure. He was on warfarin and aspirin for his LVAD with goal INR of 1.5–2.0. He presented to the emergency department with light-headedness and hematochezia for several days. He had no prior history of GIB. His physical examination and vital signs were unremarkable. His INR was 2.8, creatinine was 2.3 mg/dl, and hemoglobin was 10.4 from baseline of 12 to 13 g/dl. His last screening colonoscopy was 4 years prior and was reportedly unremarkable. He was admitted for close monitoring, serial laboratory testing, and gastroenterology consultation. He underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealing a gastric ulcer with a clean base with no evidence of active bleeding. A colonoscopy revealed a likely malignant tumor in the cecum, diverticulosis, and nonbleeding colonic angiodysplastic lesions []. The cecal mass was biopsied; it appeared to be actively bleeding and uncontrollable endoscopically. These findings were relayed to the emergency general surgery team.
He was taken emergently to the operating room. A midline laparotomy was undertaken and he was found to have a cecal mass that was perforated into a retroperitoneal abscess. The right colon was mobilized to the hepatic flexure and the abscess cavity was debrided. A right colectomy was performed with a stapled side-to-side ileocolonic anastomosis. A drain was placed in the abscess cavity, fascia was closed, and the skin and subcutaneous tissues were packed with gauze.
Final pathology showed no evidence of malignancy. It revealed a transmural defect of 1.0 cm × 0.5 cm with organizing hematoma and acute on chronic inflammation. Cytomegalovirus testing was negative. There was focal re-epithelialization, thus making bleeding diverticulum a possible diagnosis.
The patient's postoperative course was complicated by prolonged ileus necessitating total parenteral nutrition and pelvic abscess that required percutaneous drain placement. The patient additionally had bacteremia and fungemia. The patient's postoperative complications eventually resolved, and he was discharged to home with home health.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 12-year-old girl presented to our clinic with a chief complaint of trismus. A few months ago, she noticed a bulge in the left maxillary gingiva and trismus. There was no spontaneous pain, but pressure pain was felt. She was afebrile, had no history of trauma or medications. During her first medical examination at our clinic, she was 164 cm tall, weighed 54 kg. Extraoral examination revealed a slight bulge in the left cheek with countenance, right and left asymmetry and trismus. The range of mouth opening was 18 mm, and there were no swollen lymph nodes that I could feel in the neck. Intraoral findings revealed a neoplastic lesion extending from the left maxillary first molar to the maxillary tuberosity (). It interfered with the occlusion on that side.
Panoramic radiography showed impaction of the left maxillary second molar and resorption of alveolar bone between the left maxillary molar area and the maxillary tuberosity ().
Computed tomography (CT) images showed a mass that extended from the left masticator space to the buccal space and the alveolar regions of the maxilla and mandible and pressure resorption of the anterior border of ramus, rear wall of the maxillary sinus and lateral plate of the pterygoid process. Involvement of the maxillary sinus was also suspected. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a high signal in a range similar to CT (). Contrast-enhanced effects in the left cervical and retropharyngeal (Rouviere) lymph nodes were also detected. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG)-positron emission tomography/CT showed a mass measuring 63 × 38 × 45 mm (long axis × minor axis × height) located in the left maxillary gingiva, accompanied by abnormal accumulation of 18FDG (standardized uptake value [SUV] max, 8.3), and left cervical lymphadenopathy, accompanied by abnormal accumulation of 18FDG (SUVmax, 41.72), which was suspected as metastasis. Abnormal accumulation was not observed in the other organs.
The differential diagnosis for a malignant tumor of oral soft tissue includes squamous cell carcinoma, sarcoma and salivary gland malignant tumor. Ameloblastoma is considered in the differential diagnosis for a maxillary tumor with trismus. Ameloblastoma is a benign tumor that presents as a bulge on the jawbone and causes bone resorption. It has included extraosseous/peripheral ameloblastoma [].
Three days after the first medical examination, a biopsy of the lesion was performed in the left maxillary gingiva with the consent of the patient and parents to obtain a definitive diagnosis. The sectioned surface was milky-white with enhancing characteristics (). Histopathological examination showed proliferation of oval to spindle-shaped cells, with hyperchromatic nuclei and a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio, arranged in a fascicular pattern (). Mitotic figures were frequently observed. Focally, the tumor cells were arranged in small nests and in a pseudo-capillary pattern in the sclerotic collagenous stroma (). Immunohistochemical examination revealed that the tumor cells were positive for desmin, myoD1, myogenin, mammary serum antigen and glial fibrillary acidic protein (). The Ki67 proliferation index was ~30% per HPF (). The details of immunostaining are shown in . The patient was diagnosed with RMS classified as Group III according to the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS) grouping system []. The left maxillary gingiva RMS was treated via proton beam irradiation at 59.4 Gy and with vacuum-assisted wound closure therapy with 14 cycles of vincristine, actinomycin D and cyclophosphamide. After chemoradiotherapy, a complete response was documented via image evaluation.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"Peter and his family arrived to our clinical service when he was 14 months old. Perinatal anamnesis documented full-term birth after cesarean section with adequate extra-uterus adjustment, risk for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and reduced cranial diameters and good general health conditions at discharge from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). At 1 month, the analyses confirmed the significant reduction in brain volume. A diagnostic follow-up at 5 months documented the onset of epileptic seizures. Overall, Peter appeared to be easily dysregulated by moderate-to-high intensity stimulations and poor emotional regulation were reported.
To obtain more specific and fine-grained information on Peter’s emotional regulation during a standardized observational procedure.
During the Play episode, Peter was specifically sensitive to tactile (e.g., mother caressing) and auditory (e.g., mother singing) stimulations. In response to this kind of stimulations, Peter showed positive emotionality (e.g., rhythmic movements of the chest and arms together with wide mouth opening). During the Still-Face episode, Peter immediately appeared alert and sensitive to the suspension of maternal communication by exhibiting an immediate stress response (i.e., increase of motor activity and emergence of disorganized movements of the chest and arms). Interestingly, specific patterns of dyadic matching behaviors emerged including attempts to reach out with the arms directed to the mother’s body while simultaneously seeking eye-contact with her in order to be picked up. Such relational regulatory strategies were something that Peter usually did not show when distressed, as he easily became disorganized.
During the maternal unavailability episode Peter shows a clear ability to regulate his own behavior and emotions through relational strategies, something otherwise non-observable with a different observational procedure. Although such regulatory strategies may not be usual for the infant, it is clinically relevant to highlight that in response to specific relational and environmental adjustments (i.e., face-to-face interaction, lowered stimulation, enough time to organize other-directed attempts to self-regulate) Peter can access to more adaptive strategies to achieve regulation. This knowledge enriches the picture of Peter difficulties in self-stabilization and highlights a dyadic pattern to reinforce in order to support infant’s socio-emotional regulation.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"The 37-year-old woman presented with a three-month history of continuous pain in the right shoulder and chest. She was taken to our department of cardiothoracic surgery. Physical examination was remarkable for palpable lymph nodes in the bilateral supraclavicular fossae. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed an oval mass located in the anterior mediastinum. Circumambient lung tissue was involved. Haematological findings were: WBC 15.40 × 109/L, platelets 364 × 109/L, prothrombin time 10.3 sec. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), blood biochemistry, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, urine analysis and the endocrine profile were within normal range except hemoglobin (106 g/L) and tumor specific growth factor (67 U/ML). The abdominal ultrasonography did not reveal any other abnormality.
The surgery was performed with the patient under general anesthesia and left lateral decubitus position. The procedure revealed an oval tumor, volume of which was 7 cm × 4.5 cm × 2.5 cm, in the anterior mediastinum and circumambient lung tissue was involved. Pathologic findings during surgery showed that the tumor was off-white with obscure boundaries and hard in consistence (Figure ). The result of pathology hinted that the tumor maybe malignant lymphoma. The tumor and circumambient lung tissue which was involved were excised.
Histology showed the tumor was nodular and different nodules were separated by collagen fibers (Figure ). There were two morphologically and immunophenotypically distinct components. The great mass of nodules showed a pleomorphic cellular infiltrate containing lymphocyte, eosinophile granulocyte, neutrophile granulocyte and numerous large Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg cells. The Reed-Sternberg cells were positive for CD30, CD15 and MUM1 but negative for CD20, CD79a, CD3, Pax-5, CD68, bcl-6, CD10, CD45, Igκ, Igλ and epithelial membrane antigen (Figure , Figure ). Other nodules displayed sheets of relatively uniform large lymphoid cells with typical morphologic features of large cell lymphoma which showed uniform expression of CD20, CD79a, MUM1, CD45, Igλ, Pax-5 and absence of CD30, CD15, CD3, CD10, bcl-6, Igκ, CD68 and epithelial membrane antigen (Figure , Figure ). All the primary antibodies are listed in Table . Neither cell population showed makers of EBV infection by EBER in situ hybridization (PanPath Company, Amsterdam, Netherlands). On the basis of histomorphology at light microscopy, the presence of immunohistochemical staining and in situ hybridization, a diagnosis of CL, combination of NSHL and DLBCL, in the anterior mediastinum was made. The patient received six courses of CHOP chemotherapy (a course of treatment every two weeks) and twenty three times radiotherapy (Gross Tumor Volume, GTV = 40Gy/20f; Planning Target Volume, PTV = 36 Gy/20f). After treatment, lymph nodes in the bilateral supraclavicular fossa disappeared. The total follow-up period was thirty three months after surgery. The repeated CT scans, abdominal ultrasonography and tumor specific growth factor every three months revealed no recurring or residual lesion.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"An 85-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department of our hospital with coma and shock. She had not visited any hospital previously, had never been examined for complications of diabetes, and had never consumed any medications before. On admission, her vital signs were as follows: consciousness, Glasgow Coma Scale score 3/15 (E1V1M1); blood pressure, 80/40 mm Hg; pulse rate, 130 bpm; and temperature, 37.3°C. Laboratory analysis revealed neutropenia (neutrophils count, 640/µL) and elevated C-reactive protein level to 12.73 mg/dL. The levels of blood glucose and hemoglobin (Hb)A1c were 237 mg/dL and 12.1%, respectively. Blood and urine cultures showed the presence of Escherichia coli. CT of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast revealed diffuse gas collection within the urinary bladder wall (Figures , , ), which is a typical sign of EC caused by gas-forming bacteria., The patient was intensively treated with a broad-spectrum antibiotic meropenem hydrate and a vasopressor, and was put on respirator and catheterized; however, she died within 2 days due to circulatory failure.

"A 50-year-old lady, who had a history of hypertension, presented with severe headache and ataxia. CT scan done at admission showed acute right cerebellar hematoma []. DSA done subsequently revealed fusiform aneurysm of the cisternal segment of the SCA []. Endovascular treatment was done under general anesthesia with inside out coiling of the aneurysm with platinum coils []. Standard heparin protocol was followed and an activated clotting time greater than 250 s was maintained during the procedure. 5F Envoy (cordis) guiding catheter was placed in the distal vertebral artery. A combination of echelon-10 micro-catheter (ev3) and transcend 0.014 micro-wire (Stryker) were used to access the aneurysms and multiple axiom (ev3) coils were used to occlude the aneurysm. Post-coiling angiogram showed complete exclusion of the aneurysm from the circulation. The post-operative period was uneventful.

"A 61-year-old man with diabetes mellitus underwent uneventful phacoemulsification and implantation of IOL (AcrySof SA60AT; Alcon Surgery) in the right eye in December 2013. Later, he presented with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, retinal detachment, and vitreous hemorrhage with a vision of hand motion in the right eye. PPV and silicone oil tamponade were performed in November 2014. Postoperative course was smooth and vision was 20/120. Removal of silicone oil and intravitreal air injection was performed in March 2016, and postoperative vision was 20/100. However, whitish granular deposits were observed in the anterior surface of the IOL confined to the pupillary zone 1 month after surgery and vision decreased to 20/120 []. The opacification and his vision were stationary in the 9-month follow-up.

"A 38-year-old married female without any past or family history of psychiatric or neurological illness and with good premorbid functioning. She was harboring delusion of infidelity against her husband along with disturbed socio-occupational and biological functioning for the past 6 years. There was no history of substance use disorders, except excessive caffeine use, or any high risk sexual behavior. Organic psychiatric disorder or symptoms of schizophrenia were not evident. Detailed general physical examination including neurological evaluation did not reveal any abnormality except mild pallor. She reported regular menstruation and the last childbirth was 10 years back. Mental status examination revealed that she was having an uncooperative and aggressive attitude, delusion of infidelity, impaired judgment, and lack of insight. So, she was admitted to psychiatry ward with a diagnosis of persistent delusional disorder as per International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition. She was started on intramuscular olanzapine 10 mg/day. On investigation, her complete hemogram revealed a Hb of 11.5 gms/dL and a serum ferritin level of 30.2 ngm/ml (normal value for females is 10-291 ng/mL). Other routine hematological and biochemical parameters including blood sugar, renal, liver, and thyroid function were within normal limits. We also planned a vitamin B12 and folic acid estimation which could not be done due to lack of resources.
Within 4-5 days of starting olanzapine, there was a decrease in her aggression and she became cooperative for interviewing. However, she would report that she was having sleeping difficulty due to an itching sensation in both upper and lower limbs at night. She would rub her legs against bedclothes, tie pieces of cloth around her limbs, and ask for limb massage to get relief from such a discomfort. She would have such symptoms for hours after lying down at night. During daytime, she would, however, feel comfortable, relaxed, and was able to sleep. She was evaluated for sleep disorder-before this she never had any sleep complaint, neither was there any family history of sleep disorder. During sleep, there was no history of snoring, no abnormal limb or breathing movements. Ear, nose, throat examination was also noncontributory. She was having a thin built and a body mass index of 15.56. As she became cooperative, she was shifted to oral psychotropics (olanzapine 15 mg/day + clonazepam 1 mg at bedtime). Also oral iron supplementation in the form of ferrous fumarate 350 mg, vitamin B12, and ascorbic acid was started. To improve her sleep, general sleep hygiene practices were initiated, she was prohibited from taking any caffeine beverages at night and the clonazepam was further increased up to 2 mg at bedtime. But there was no improvement in her nighttime symptoms.
In view of her above symptoms and investigations, she was diagnosed to have RLS with an International Restless Legs Scale Score (IRLS) of 24 indicating high severity and olanzapine was considered to be the probable cause. Hence, the olanzapine was decreased to 10 mg/day and oral risperidone 2 mg was added at bedtime. On the next day, the severity of symptoms decreased to a RLS score of 12. No other change in medication was done during this period. So, after 2 days, olanzapine was stopped and risperidone was increased to 6 mg at bedtime. Thereafter, her troublesome symptoms ceased completely. Though she still harbored the delusions yet the conviction decreased and she became more cooperative with her husband and the treating clinician. Then after about a week of uneventful ward stay, she was discharged free of her sleep-related difficulties on risperidone 6 mg and clonazepam 1 mg at bedtime with the plan to continue her antipsychotic drugs and iron supplementation on an outpatient basis.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 14-year-old Chinese Malaysian boy presented to University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur in September 2013 with history of recurrent pneumonia, poor growth and steatorrhoea since childhood. He had finger clubbing and bronchiectasis. Later, he was diagnosed with CF and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from his sputum. He received 3 weeks of intravenous ceftazidime (50 mg/kg/dose, QDS) and gentamicin (5 mg/kg/dose, OD). He was discharged with azithromycin (5 mg/kg EOD), nebulised gentamicin (80 mg BD) amongst other CF-related medications. In November 2013, he was readmitted with a pulmonary exacerbation and his sputum sample grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and he received intravenous vancomycin, oral rifampicin (300 mg BD) and sodium fusidate (500 mg TDS) with significant clinical improvement. During a follow-up visit in December 2013, he had a productive cough but was apyrexic. He was empirically treated with oral ciprofloxacin (750 mg BD) and the sputum sample later isolated B.pseudomallei. As he clinically improved, the treatment regimen remained unchanged. Subsequently, the repeat sputum samples were negative for B.pseudomallei and he continued to remain active with good exercise tolerance and relatively stable lung function. It is noteworthy that he had been residing in an urban area of non-endemicity for melioidosis and there were no other known risk factors identified.
In August 2014, he was admitted with another pulmonary exacerbation and his cultured sputum grew B.pseudomallei and Pseudomonas spp. His chest radiograph showed diffused interstitial changes with bronchiectasis throughout both lungs with minimal pleural effusions. He received 2 weeks of intravenous ceftazidime (2 g; 6hourly) and amikacin (720 mg; 15 mg/kg/OD). Upon completion of antibiotics, he remained afebrile and the chest auscultatory findings improved. He was discharged with 6 months of oral doxycycline, and co-trimoxazole to treat the B.pseudomallei and 3 months of nebulized amikacin for chronic P.aeruginosa. He still continued on his alternate day of azithromycin (250 mg).
A detailed travel history revealed that in June 2014, he visited recreational parks in Sabah, Malaysia. During the visit, he went jungle trekking, snorkeling and dipped in a hot-water spring. It is noteworthy that melioidosis is endemic in Sabah, one of the two East Malaysian states on the island of Borneo, where B.pseudomallei prominently occurs in soil and water. Later then, he was admitted 3 monthly for antibiotic tuning and his sputum culture had no specific bacterial growth.
In August 2015, there was a decline in his lung function tests with deterioriorating cough. A bronchoscopy was performed and Burkholderia cepacia was isolated from his bronchoalveoloar lavage specimen, while acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear was weakly positive. Initially, the patient was treated with intravenous imipenem and ceftazidime for 3 weeks but had recurrence of fever. However, the sputum AFB smears remained positive although the suspected nontuberculous mycobacterium could not be isolated despite various culturing techniques. Therefore, the antibiotics were changed to intravenous meropenem, doxycycline, amikacin and oral clarithromycin to treat both the B.cepacia and the suspected nontuberculous mycobacterium.
Upon discharge, he had been continuing with amoxicillin-clavulanate and doxycycline for 6 months, which helped with weight gain and secretion reduction. Repeat AFB smear remained negative for the subsequent 5 months. However, in January 2016, further decline in his lung function was observed with worsening respiratory symptoms. A chest computed tomography showed worsening bronchiectasis, tree in bud appearance in the lung peripheries, patchy consolidation and several enlarged lymph nodes at the right paratracheal region (Fig. ). His sputum sample grew P.aeruginosa and was also strongly positive for AFB. Intravenous meropenem and ceftazidime (for P.aeruginosa) and combination therapy of rifampicin, ethambutol, azithromycin and nebulized amikacin (for nontuberculous mycobacterium) was started. He improved clinically and was discharged with the above oral medications for 6 months.
B.pseudomallei was isolated once again in April 2016 and he was treated with intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate and ceftazidime for 3 weeks. He was then discharged with 6 months of oral amoxicillin-clavulanate. However, in May 2016, his antibiotics were changed to levofloxacin (750 mg) and clarithromycin (500 mg). Following that, for the next 8 months, his sputum sample continued to grow B.pseudomallei but was negative for AFB. Despite many admissions for intravenous antibiotics against B.pseudomallei, the patient passed away from end stage respiratory failure in February 2017. Bacteriological reports were reviewed, and over the 3 years, the patient had several infective exacerbations and his sputum samples grew Gram-negative organisms that were later identified to be B.pseudomallei, Pseudomonas spp., P.aeruginosa, or B.cepacia (Table ).
All the isolates were found to have different susceptibility patterns (resistant to co-trimoxazole; intermediate to doxycycline and susceptible to all other antibiotics). The B.pseudomallei isolated in 2013, 2014 and 2016 (UMC083, UMC 082 and UMC114, respectively), were also further confirmed as B.pseudomallei using API 20NE (Biomerieux, France), Ashdown agar and also an in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers []. However, we were not able to obtain the B.pseudomallei isolated in 2017.
The isolates were characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), a method of molecular subtyping that compares sequences of seven housekeeping genes [], and repetitive-element PCR (rep-PCR). It appeared that these isolates were of two different sequence type (ST); ST51 (UMC083 and UMC114), which is a common ST found widely in Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong and China, and ST1644, (UMC082) a new ST. The STs were deposited in the B.pseudomallei MLST database ().","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 74-year-old woman, with controlled hypertension and dyslipidaemia, presented to the emergency department due to altered speech, left-sided facial droop and decreased muscle strength on the right side of her body with 12 hours of evolution. Physical examination showed aphasia, central facial nerve palsy on the left side, slight right-sided hemiparesis, Babinski’s sign on the left and fever. Computed tomography of the head (head-CT) showed bilateral nucleocapsular and subcortical fronto-parietal ischaemic infarctions of unknown date. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm and the thorax x-ray a small left pleural effusion. Blood analysis showed 14,400 leucocytes/μl, increased C-reactive protein (217.8 mg/l), LDH 459 U/l and INR 1.57. The patient was medicated with aspirin and hospitalized with ischaemic stroke. Blood cultures were collected. Doppler ultrasonography of the neck vessels and a trans-thoracic echocardiogram showed no alterations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple acute ischaemic infarctions scattered over both cerebellar and cerebral hemispheres, reflecting strokes in the posterior and anterior circulations ().
Given the possibility of cardioembolic aetiology, enoxaparin was initiated (on the 7th day of hospitalization), however transoesophageal echocardiography showed no alterations. Neurological deficits deteriorated on the day anticoagulation was started, leading to prostration. Head-CT was repeated, revealing a massive parenchymal haematoma in the left frontal region which led to suspension of the enoxaparin.
After the most common stroke aetiologies were excluded, the following examinations were performed, but showed no alterations: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin and anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies, antithrombin III, proteins S and C, antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies, mutation of the prothrombin gene and factor V Leiden, and HIV, HBV, HCV and VDRL serologies. Antinuclear antibodies were positive (1:160) and D-dimers were high at 1,644 μg/l (normal <230 μg/l), while fibrinogen was low at 1.4 g/l (normal 2–4 g/l).
A whole-body CT scan revealed a solid lesion in the left lower lobe of the left lung, multiple mediastinal pathological lymph nodes, peripheral lung thromboembolism with greater expression on the right, right femoropopliteal venous thrombosis and splenic and renal infarctions (–).
Faced with the impossibility of resuming anticoagulation immediately, a filter was placed on the inferior vena cava. Cerebral angiography showed occlusion of the right internal carotid artery (recall previous normal Doppler ultrasonography of the neck vessels) and excluded vasculitis.
Endoscopic ultrasound-guided transoesophageal biopsy of a mediastinal lymph node revealed non-small cell lung cancer. Immunohistochemistry testing for the lung cancer subtype proved inconclusive.
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with multiple brain and systemic thrombotic events was diagnosed as a manifestation of a paraneoplastic syndrome of the hidden lung neoplasia. With favourable evolution of the brain haemorrhage, enoxaparin was resumed 2 weeks after the event. However, as there were new thromboembolic events despite the reintroduction of anticoagulation, it was definitively suspended due to progressively worsening thrombocytopenia.
During hospitalization, the patient remained feverish, with high inflammatory parameters, but no infectious source was identified and microbiological cultures were negative. Such alterations were considered to be correlated with systemic thromboses.
At this stage, the patient was mute and tetraparetic, with a level 4 performance status (ECOG). It was decided in a multidisciplinary meeting not to start cytostatics as no benefit was anticipated in view of the advanced neoplasia (stage IIIB/IV) and a high degree of dependence. The patient was referred to palliative care and died a few days later.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"The 48-year-old woman unintentionally felt a painless mass of about 2 cm × 1 cm in the upper outer quadrant of her left breast in March 2017, which gradually enlarged due to her neglect. In September 2017, the mass rapidly enlarged to 7cm × 6 cm, and there was infiltrated erythema and ulceration on the skin of the breast. In October 2017, she was admitted to our hospital and received mammary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (), which showed a 91 mm × 55 mm × 87 mm mass with ill-defined margins and a heterogeneous internal enhancement in the left breast; breast imaging reporting and data system (BI-RADS) category was identified as 5. Additionally, enlarged lymph nodes in her left axilla were observed. Laboratory examinations presented normal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level (0.926 ng/ml) and high cancer antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) level (61.4 U/ml). Subsequently, core needle biopsy was performed on October 28, 2017, and invasive ductal carcinoma was pathologically diagnosed, histological grade 2, with estrogen receptor (ER) negative and progesterone receptor (PR) negative, overexpression of HER-2 (+++), and high proliferation index Ki-67 (70%) (). The patient was in good health without any medical history of hypertension or diabetes and without smoking, drinking, and other bad habits. She had menarche at 13 years old, and the last menstrual period was October 11, 2017. Before any treatment, we offered a thorough examination and excluded any distant metastases. The clinical stage was cT4N2aM0 according to the 7th edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual ().
As pertuzumab and T-DM1 had not been approved in China at that time, after obtaining informed consent, we adopted a TCbH regimen (docetaxel, 75 mg/m2 d1; carboplatin, AUC = 6 d1; trastuzumab, 8 mg/kg for the first cycle and 6 mg/kg thereafter d1, 21 days/cycle) as first-line treatment according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. After five cycles (November 6, 2017–January 30, 2018), reexamination of mammary MRI () showed the size of the mass shrank from 91 mm × 55 mm × 87 mm to 84 mm × 48 mm × 72 mm. According to the evaluation criteria of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, we judged the therapeutic effect as stable disease (SD).
Based on the NOAH test (), limited cycles of joint application of trastuzumab and anthracycline were effective and had controllable cardiac toxicity. Therefore, we choose ECH (epirubicin, 90 mg/m2 d1; cycloposphamide, 600 mg/m2 d1; trastuzumab, 6 mg/kg d1, 21 days/cycle) regimen as second-line treatment (February 27, 2018–May 23, 2018). After four cycles, re-examined mammary MRI () showed that the tumor shrank from 84 mm × 48 mm × 72 mm to 66 mm × 29 mm × 56 mm. According to the evaluation criteria of RECIST v1.1, the therapeutic effect was still SD. There was no significant change in the appearance of the breast ().
As the efficacy still did not reach PR, the regimen was altered to nab-paclitaxel combined with trastuzmab. For metastatic breast cancer patients who had received prior taxanes, nab-paclitaxel plus still has the objective response rate of 54.2% (), and nab-paclitaxel plus traszumab to EC was superior to taxanes combined with trastuzumab to EC as neo-adjuvant therapy in GBG 69 trial (). Therefore, we choose nab-paclitaxel plus trastuzumab as the third-line treatment (nab-paclitaxel, 125 mg/m2 d1, d8; trastuzumab, 6 mg/kg d1, 21 days/cycle). The patient got PR after the first two cycles (), but two cycles later, the efficacy deteriorated to progressive disease (PD) ().
As the patient had developed acquired trastuzumab resistance after three lines of trastuzumab-based regimen, another regimen with distinct mechanism of anti-HER2 therapy was needed. To investigate the potential reason of drug resistance, a next-generation gene sequencing (NGS) of 425-gene panel was performed using the tissue repunctured from the tumor. According to the NGS report, persistent existence of ERBB2, CDK12, and MYC amplification with abundance of 15.7, 16.2, and 7.6 were detected, respectively. Meanwhile, there were mutations as p.R314H on IDH1 gene and p.H179R on TP53 gene. On ERBB2 gene, the patient had L755S () and K907R mutation. L755S mutation indicated resistance to trastuzumab and lapatinib (, ) and may be sensitive to neratinib (), an irreversible pan-HER TKI. At that time, neratinib had not been admitted to China, and a similar agent, pyrotinib, had just been approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (cFDA), whose phase II trial had indicated that for the treatment of advanced HER2-positive breast cancer patients, pyrotinib combined with capecitabine had better efficacy than lapatinib combined with capecitabine (). Thus, we selected pyrotinib plus capecitabine (pyrotinib, 400 mg/d d1–21; capecitabine, 1,250 mg/m2 bid d1–14, 21 days/cycle) as the fourth-line treatment regimen. After six cycles (August 28, 2018–December 29, 2018), the patient got PR (), and the surface of the breast almost completely healed ().
Left breast cancer mastectomy and local rotation skin flap grafting were performed on the patient in January 16, 2019, and postoperative pathology report showed an invasive ductal carcinoma with changes in Miller–Payne Grade 4 (), with a tumor size of 1.0 cm × 0.8 cm × 0.8 cm and lymph nodes negative (0/14). Immunohistochemistry indicated ER (−), PR (−), C-erbb-2 (+++), and ki-67 (70%+) ().
The patient continued to receive pyrotinib plus capecitabine (pyrotinib, 400 mg/day d1–21; capecitabine, 1,250 mg/m2 bid d1–14, 21 days/cycles) synchronous with radiotherapy (left chest wall plus left supraclavicular area, 5,000 cGy/25f), and pyrotinib plus capecitabine continued to be administrated for 1 year. There were no signs of metastasis or recurrence after an overall examination after 1 year of adjuvant therapy with pyrotinib plus capecitabine. The patient suspended capecitabin due to severe hand–foot syndrome and took pyrotinib as single agent for another 1 year (), partially referred to ExteNET clinical trial (). By the time of contribution, the second (June 2019) and last regular follow-ups (March 2021) showed no signs of metastasis or recurrence ().","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 59-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with locally advanced lung adenocarcinoma. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a tumor in the right upper lobe that had invaded the middle lobe and S6 segment, as well as hilar lymphadenopathy (#12u and #11 s) without mediastinal lymph node swelling (cT2aN1M0). An ESL procedure (right upper, middle lobectomies and S6 segmentectomy) that preserves the basal segment with a double-sleeve technique was considered in order to avoid a right pneumonectomy in this patient. Since successful ex situ auto-transplantation after a pneumonectomy for locally advanced lung cancer has been reported [, ], the Dokkyo Medical University Hospital Ethics Committee approved our protocol (#26030) for an operation including a back-table procedure and auto-lung transplantation after a pneumonectomy for locally advanced lung cancer to examine its merits. Such an auto-lung-transplantation protocol was performed in the present case for curative resection and basal-segment preservation. Consent to participate and to publish this study was obtained from the patient before surgery.
We initially performed a 5th intercostal posterolateral thoracotomy. After administration of intravenous heparin and prostaglandin E1, the pulmonary artery and vein were clamped, and the right pneumonectomy was completed. For a venous anastomosis between the lower pulmonary vein of the graft and upper pulmonary vein of the body, the pulmonary veins were dissected as distal as possible for the upper pulmonary vein and proximal as possible as for the lower pulmonary vein (Fig. ). Following completion of the pneumonectomy, the excised lung was irrigated with a cold low-potassium phosphate-buffered dextran glucose solution (EP-TU solution; Cell Science & Technology Institute, Sendai, Japan) to protect the lung graft from ischemia-reperfusion injury during preparation of the graft of the basal segment as a back-table procedure. At the same time, another surgeon performed a mediastinal lymph node dissection to shorten the operation time. Thereafter, basal segment auto-transplantation was performed in the order of bronchus, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary vein anastomosis. Finally, the basal pulmonary vein of the graft was anastomosed to the upper pulmonary vein orifice. The operation time was 359 min and blood loss was 305 g.
The postoperative course was uneventful and no ischemia-reperfusion injury was observed, and the patient was discharged from the intensive care unit 1 day after the operation. The pathological diagnosis was pT2aN2M0 adenocarcinoma. Following surgery, the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel. At 9 months after the operation, she had returned to normal life without recurrence of the primary disease.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"Patient (3) is a 4 years old boy, the third in order of birth of first cousin marriage. He presented to the hepatology clinic with jaundice following an attack of vomiting and diarrhea. He had a similar attack at the age of two years that regressed spontaneously.
On examination the patient had progressive neurologic dysfunction, his height was 95 cm (-2 SD), weight was 13 kg (-3 SD) and skull circumference was 43 cm. He had characteristic physical appearance with enophthalmia, nystagmus, jaundice, and skin photosensitivity. His liver was 4 cm below the costal margin, firm in consistency with rounded border and smooth surface. The spleen was felt two cm below the costal margin. Neurological examination showed intention tremors, cerebellar ataxia, lost knee and preserved ankle deep reflexes. Chest and heart examination were clinically free.
Investigations at that time revealed ALT: 270 IU/L (N: 37), AST: 232 IU/L (N: 40) GGT: 183 (N: 50), total bilirubin: 3.35 mg/dl, direct bilirubin: 2.6 mg/dl, albumin: 3.2 g/dl, PT 11.7 sec. (INR: 1). Tests for HBV, HCV, and HAV revealed negative results. Ceruloplasmin level, protein electrophoresis and auto antibodies were also normal.
Abdominal ultrasonography revealed enlarged liver with regular border, homogenous echopatteren, patent portal and hepatic veins. Fundus examination showed no abnormality. CT brain was normal, while MRI brain showed deep white matter signal alteration at the forceps minor and major regions, middle cerebellar peduncles, the posterior segmental aspects of the pontine isthmus and basis pontis. Those areas exhibited bright signal on FLAIR and T2W1, a picture consistent with dysmyelinating disease.
The patient received ursodeoxycholic acid at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day and vitamin E (100 mg/day). Two months later, ALT decreased to 83 IU/L, AST decreased to 95 IU/L, total bilirubin was: 1.7 mg/dl, direct bilirubin: 0.7 mg/dl, albumin: 3.2 g/dl, and PT 11.3 seconds.
Six months later, the patient had another similar attack that was also precipitated by viral infection and was associated with increased tremors, ataxia and inability to walk. He received the same treatment with excellent response and complete recovery of liver functions, and improvement of ataxia, and tremors.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 55-year-old man with a weight of 76 kg and height of 178 cm, suddenly experienced a nontraumatic loss of consciousness after a cough attack at an upright position as reported by a witness. Two months prior, he was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and had been receiving antituberculosis treatment. On arrival, the patient was unconscious with a Glasgow coma scale score of 6, blood pressure of 169/89 mm Hg, regular heart rate of 85 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 18/minute, body temperature of 36.5°C, SaO2 of 82% at room air, and capillary blood sugar of 110 mg/dL. Auscultation of the lungs revealed an inspiratory crackle at the left lung field. After rapid intravenous access and oxygenation, the patient was sedated, the trachea was intubated, mechanical ventilation was initiated, and conservative treatment was maintained in the intensive care unit. Urgent computed tomography (CT) of the brain was performed and showed multiple air shadows in both hemispheres and the right cerebral vessels (). These lesions suggest air embolism. Twelve hours later, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed and showed a diffuse ischemic stroke in the right and left frontoparietal cortical areas and multiple hypointense signals, which were consistent with cerebral air embolism ().
The brain perfusion images were normal. The chest CT performed at the emergency department showed pulmonary tuberculosis cavity associated with the destruction of parenchyma in the left upper lobe (). There was no evidence of cerebral hemorrhage. The diagnosis of cerebral gas embolism after sudden cough was retained, and immediate treatment was started including 100% oxygen and cardiovascular support while the patient was placed in a supine position. The transthoracic echocardiography was performed, and no patent foramen ovale was found. A lumbar puncture was performed to seek for tuberculous meningoencephalitis. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was considered, but the patient’s condition was too unstable to support transfer to the hyperbaric oxygen center. One day later, his neurological status deteriorated. The patient died on the fourth day with multiple organ failure. No autopsy was performed based on his family’s wishes.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"An eleven-year-old male, castrated, 47.2 kg Labrador Retriever presented to the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) in November 2018 for placement of a urethral stent. The patient had been diagnosed with transitional cell carcinoma via traumatic catheterization in January 2018, for which he had been seen monthly at the primary referral veterinary center to receive routine ultrasound examinations and chemotherapy (mitoxantrone 6.2 mg intravenously monthly) through October 2018. Over time the patient developed stranguria and there was evidence of thickening of the prostatic urethra in addition to a tumor present in the trigone. At presentation to the VTH, the patient was receiving piroxicam 17 mg q24h PO, milk thistle 175 mg q24h PO, S-adenosyl-methionine 400 mg q24h PO, omega fatty acid supplement 1600 mg q24h PO, and a vitamin B12 supplement.
From the time of initial diagnosis, routine monthly CBCs had been performed with no major abnormalities detected. Biochemical screening had been performed intermittently, with serial monitoring of BUN and Creatinine during chemotherapy treatment. At presentation for placement of the stent, the patient’s most recent bloodwork showed a slightly elevated BUN at 30 mg/dL (Reference Interval (RI) 7–27), elevated ALT at 159 U/L (RI 10–125), elevated ALKP at 981 U/L (RI 23–212), a slight neutrophilia at 13,110/μL (RI 2950-11,640), urine specific gravity 1.027, and a moderate amount of both blood and protein on free-catch urinalysis. Remaining values were unremarkable and within normal reference ranges. Physical examination revealed obesity (body condition score 8/9), mild to moderate hindlimb muscle atrophy, moderate dental tartar, several epidermal collarettes across the ventral abdomen, and a prominent urethra on rectal examination; all other findings were unremarkable. Ultrasound of the urogenital tract revealed thickening of the proximal urethral wall extending cranially into the neck of the bladder, punctate hyperechoic foci throughout the prostate, and a dilated left kidney pelvis and associated ureter.
Based on these findings, it was elected to perform cystoscopy with placement of a ureteral and/or urethral stent to relieve the stranguria. The patient was fasted overnight before anesthesia. Maropitant 1 mg/kg subcutaneously was administered prior to butorphanol 0.2 mg/kg intramuscularly and an intravenous catheter was placed to facilitate anesthetic induction. Induction consisted of intravenous fentanyl 5μg/kg followed by alfaxalone 1 mg/kg to effect. Following endotracheal intubation, the patient was maintained on sevoflurane in 100% oxygen with a fentanyl continuous rate infusion (CRI) at 10μg/kg/hr. and lactated ringer’s solution (LRS) at 5 mL/kg/hr. Anesthetic monitoring included capnography, pulse oximetry, esophageal temperature, electrocardiography (ECG), fractional expired sevoflurane (FESevo), fractional inspired oxygen percentage (FiO2), and direct arterial blood pressure.
Following placement of monitoring equipment, the patient was repositioned from sternal to dorsal recumbency in preparation for cystoscopy. At this time, mean arterial pressure (MAP) declined from 61 mmHg to 40 mmHg while the heart rate began increasing from 128 beats per minute (bpm). Sevoflurane was reduced while a fluid bolus of 10 mL/kg was initiated and a dopamine CRI started at 5μg/kg/min. The blood pressure did not improve, with the MAP around 45 mmHg, and the heart rate continued to climb to 180 bpm with the appearance of intermittent ventricular premature complexes. Lidocaine 2 mg/kg was bolused intravenously and a CRI at 2 mg/kg/hr. started while dopamine was increased to 10μg/kg/min. Sevoflurane administration was discontinued and the breathing system flushed with fresh oxygen. Blood pressure began to increase to a MAP of 70 mmHg with the heart rate lowering to 100 bpm and the patient began to move slightly, so fentanyl was increased to 15μg/kg/hr. while sevoflurane was restarted and maintained below FESevo 1.3%. As the patient returned to a surgical plane of anesthesia, the blood pressure decreased again, although less dramatically to a MAP of 65 mmHg. Dopamine was increased to 12μg/kg/min and a norepinephrine CRI at 0.1μg/kg/min was started. This ultimately provided a balance that maintained blood pressure while keeping the patient adequately anesthetized for cystoscopy and allowed the dopamine to be reduced to 5μg/kg/min. The patient was moved from dorsal to left lateral recumbency and hypotension returned, but it responded more quickly to increases in dopamine and norepinephrine than previously. Once stent placement was completed, the patient was put into a sternal position in the thorax with pelvic limbs laterally, at this point the blood pressure began to rise quickly to a MAP of nearly 90 mmHg, and both dopamine and norepinephrine were discontinued.
Two days after uneventful recovery and discharge, the patient presented to the primary veterinary referral center with epistaxis and an incidental cranial mediastinal mass was diagnosed on thoracic radiographs. The client did not wish to pursue further workup and Yunnan Baiyao was prescribed for the epistaxis. However, the stranguria that resolved with the stent placement returned over the following 2 months and it was elected to re-evaluate the first stent and potentially place a second stent. No further epistaxis episodes occurred.
The presence of a mass in the chest, confirmed via radiographs following discharge from the first visit, and the decline and then improvement in hemodynamics correlating to changing body position during the first anesthetic episode, made us believe that positioning was going to play a key role in management of blood pressure in the second anesthetic episode. The patient’s condition was largely unchanged from the first physical examination, and bloodwork was similar. Coagulation parameters were normal. Cytologic evaluation of an aspirate of the mass, obtained via thoracic ultrasound, was most suggestive of thymoma as reported by a board-certified veterinary clinical pathologist, who also recommended biopsy with histopathology for confirmation. Although this was not pursued by the client, computed tomography (CT) imaging was performed to rule out presence of a nasal mass and to better clarify size and exact location of the thoracic mass with respect to major vessels and the heart.
The patient was premedicated with morphine 0.5 mg/kg and midazolam 0.2 mg/kg intramuscularly 1 h after receiving maropitant 1 mg/kg subcutaneously. Following sedation and catheter placement, induction was performed with a mixture of propofol 3 mg/kg and ketamine 3 mg/kg to effect. Propofol and Lidocaine CRIs were used for maintenance in place of sevoflurane, but the same monitoring as prior was utilized, including direct arterial blood pressure. Sternal recumbency was maintained throughout sedation, induction, and CT imaging. Due to the fast onset and short-acting vasoconstrictive effects of phenylephrine, it was administered in 1μg/kg boluses intravenously as needed for mild hypotension (MAP of 59-62 mmHg) during the early part of the anesthetic event, while the patient remained sternal. During this period, the blood pressure was responsive to phenylephrine and increased to a MAP of 65-75 mmHg shortly following boluses. The dramatic and poorly-responsive hypotension of the first anesthetic episode was not observed and the heart rate ranged from 80 to 110 bpm. CT imaging of the nasal cavity was unremarkable but it revealed a left cranial mediastinal, lobular, 7.5 cm (width) × 5.8 cm (height) × 6.8 cm (length) soft-tissue attenuating mass with an irregular fluid-attenuating central portion. It was noted to be causing rightward deviation of the cranial vena cava without direct vascular compression in the sternal position. For comparison, the heart measured 9.4 cm × 5.9 cm × 10.5 cm. Figures and illustrate a dorso-ventral and sagittal view of the mass as found on CT imaging.
Following CT imaging, the primary clinician requested left lateral recumbency for abdominal fluoroscopy and cystoscopy. As soon as the patient was re-positioned the mean arterial pressure dropped to 42 mmHg within 60 s. A dose of phenylephrine at 1μg/kg given intravenously failed to improve MAP in this instance. The patient was returned to sternal recumbency and MAP steadily increased back to its value prior to the change to lateral recumbency (MAP 63 mmHg). Ultimately the patient was maintained with the thorax sternal and the abdomen in oblique left lateral for the remainder of the procedure with no recurrent dramatic blood pressure changes.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 62-year-old woman complained of persistent nasal discharge with nose bleeding accompanied by right tinnitus for 2 years. A nasopharyngeal mass was found on a nasopharyngeal endoscopic examination at another hospital. Histopathology of the biopsy specimen showed nasopharyngeal malignant melanoma. After taking six cycles of temozolomide at another hospital, the nasopharyngeal mass did not decrease in size. Therefore, conventional segmentation radiotherapy was performed 20 times.
Finally, the patient was admitted to our hospital. A specialist examination showed a mass in the nasopharyngeal cavity with pigmentation on the surface and growth into the right nasal cavity. Enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) () showed masses in the right lateral wall of the nasopharyngeal cavity, which involved the nasal cavity and was consistent with melanoma. The masses showed high-signal intensity on T1-weighted images and low-signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Non-enhanced computed tomography (CT) () showed an irregular mass in the nasopharyngeal cavity with an unclear boundary with the lateral nasopharynx wall. After excluding distant metastases, such as to the chest and abdomen, the operation plan of partial resection was selected. The operation process was divided into two parts. First, surgery was performed to open the whole group of bilateral sinuses. The tumour was found at the centre of the eustachian tube, and extended forward to the nasal cavity and sinuses, and invaded the ethmoid roof and meningeal tissue. Second, the diseased meningeal tissue was removed and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhoea was repaired.
Two weeks later, subtotal resection of the right temporal bone with the Fisch type B posterior auricular approach and of the lateral cranial base lesions was performed in the second stage. Intraoperatively, the lesion was found to be located inferomedially to the cartilaginous portion of the eustachian tube. The cartilage and lesion were removed together up to the foramen lacerum and down to the pharyngeal orifice of the eustachian tube. The ICA was exposed and properly protected. Three days after the second operation, the patient developed sudden massive oral and nasal bleeding with a volume of approximately 300 mL. Therefore, nasal endoscopic probing was performed after endotracheal intubation under general anaesthesia at the site of haemorrhage on the right side of the nasopharynx. Because of continuous bleeding, we performed emergency cerebrovascular angiography and balloon (Cordis 6 × 20 mm; Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) embolization of the ICA. The specific process was as follows. Super selective arteriography of the bilateral common carotid arteries, internal carotid artery, and left vertebral artery was performed, and contrast media leakage was observed in the temporal segment of the right ICA (). Cerebral angiography showed that the anterior communicating artery was open and the bilateral anterior cerebral arteries, middle cerebral arteries, and their branches were well developed. The balloon was placed at the distal and proximal ends of the orifice of the fistula to block the blood vessel. Postoperative angiographic results are shown in . The patient developed transient myocardial ischaemia postoperatively, and 4 days after the treatment, the patient returned to the local hospital for medical treatment. No abnormalities were found on brain CT at discharge. After discharge, the patient did not receive any other comprehensive treatment. At the 6-month follow-up, the patient showed multiple bone and kidney metastases. She died of systemic metastases 1.5 years later.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 69-year-old male presented a left thyroid nodule diagnosed on FNA cytology as papillary thyroid carcinoma. During investigations, the patient was found to have multiple bone lytic lesions. Biopsies of the lumbar vertebra and left clavicle showed Langerhans cell histiocytosis. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy with left cervical lymph node dissection. Sectioning of the specimen revealed two lesions in the right thyroid lobe measuring 3.7 X 3.5 X 2.5 cm and 0.7 X 0.7 X 0.5 cm and a single lesion in the left thyroid lobe measuring 1 X 0.7 X 0.7 cm.
Additionally, the left thyroid lobe showed a goitrous nodule measuring 3.7 X 3.5 X 2.5cm. The microscopic examination concluded a multifocal classical papillary carcinoma confined to the thyroid gland with no extra-capsular extension neither lymph node involvement. However, four lymph nodes showed morphologic features of focal involvement by Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Immunohistochemical stains have confirmed these features. The Langerhans cells were positive for CD1a and negative for TTF-1. The thyroid gland was extensively examined without any morphological evidence of Langerhans cell histiocytosis involvement.
Four years later, the patient presented with anemia leukocytosis, and bone marrow biopsy showed marrow involvement by Langerhans cell histiocytosis (). The estimated degree of involvement was 40% with associated secondary myelofibrosis.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"An 83-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) with upper abdominal chest pain with newly deranged liver function tests (LFTs) and raised inflammatory markers. On examination, he was found to be tender in the right upper quadrant as well as in the epigastrium. His LFTs were as follows: unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin were both 26 and 14 µmol/L, respectively; ALP, GGT, ALT, and AST were 333, 557, 194, and 158 U/L, respectively. His white cell count was 13.9 × 109/L, and CRP was 105 mg/L. A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed due to his atypical presentation to the emergency department, which showed cholecystitis with a distended gallbladder containing a 21 mm solitary lamellated calcified calculus. This was then confirmed on abdominal ultrasound, which, in addition to the above findings, showed that there was no evidence of choledocholithiasis or biliary duct dilatation.
The patient underwent LC, performed by a senior surgical trainee with an intraoperative cholangiogram showing no filling defects in the biliary ducts and free flow of contrast into the duodenum. During the operation, the gallbladder was inadvertently opened whilst dissecting it from the liver bed, resulting in spillage of the large calculus. While retrieving the gallbladder specimen in an endoscopic bag, the spilled calculus was left inadvertently in the peritoneal cavity. The operator did not realize that the spilled stone was unretrieved. The patient made an uneventful, gradual recovery and was discharged on postoperative day 1. Macroscopic histopathology report revealed a partially opened gallbladder with no gallstone within the lumen, suggesting that the spilled large calculus was not retrieved from the peritoneal cavity. Microscopically, it was consistent with acute and chronic cholecystitis with muscle hypertrophy and fibrosis of the wall.
The patient re-presented to the emergency department 3 weeks after discharge with central abdominal pain, anorexia, and vomiting. He had been experiencing these symptoms since day 3 of discharge, and they had been getting worse until the time he re-presented. In spite of these symptoms, he was systemically well. Examination of the abdomen revealed minimally distended abdomen with tenderness in the periumbilical region. These symptoms and signs suggested that he had small bowel obstruction. However, in the setting of recent cholecystectomy, we wanted to rule out the possibility of a biliary injury. His LFTs and inflammatory markers were normal. His symptoms were further evaluated with a CT scan, which showed evidence of SBO with transition point in the right iliac fossa. The obstruction was from a laminated calcified structure applying extrinsic compression on a loop of small bowel. With the knowledge of the index operation and the pathology report of the retrieved specimen, it was suspected that this structure was the unretrieved gallstone. This calculus was associated with a surrounding phlegmon, evidenced by intense inflammatory change on the CT scan ().
The patient underwent laparoscopy in view of the CT scan findings. Laparoscopy identified a large phlegmon compressing on the distal ileum causing obstruction with distended proximal and collapsed distal small bowel loops (). Dissection of the phlegmon revealed a small abscess cavity and the unretrieved gallstone at its center (). The abscess was drained and the gallstone retrieved (), which resulted in a resolution of the small bowel obstruction. The patient made a gradual recovery and was subsequently discharged on postoperative day 4, at which point he was tolerating solid diet with return of normal gastrointestinal function.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 55-year-old man presented with fever and abdominal pain. Abdominal CT showed swelling of the right kidney and low attenuation areas (Figure ). Laboratory tests and renal CT imaging were suggestive of pyelonephritis. However, multiple cavitary lesions were also found on the routine chest radiography performed on admission. VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery) lung biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma presumably from the kidney. Therefore, a renal tumor with multiple pulmonary metastases, was considered. At the time, transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) was suspected, which later proved to be a misdiagnosis, and chemotherapy with MVAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin, and cisplatin) was given. However, the chemotherapy was not effective, and the patient died of respiratory failure 2 months later. On autopsy, the primary tumor was found to be a collecting duct carcinoma, and there were lung, liver, spleen, bone marrow, right adrenal gland, and para-aortic lymph node metastases. CT done while the patient was alive detected lung (Figure ), liver (Figure ), and para-aortic lymph node (Figure ) metastases.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 50-year-old-male, presented with the complaints of left flank pain of 1 month duration. He denied having any constitutional symptoms, voiding difficulty, ejaculatory disturbances, hematuria or constipation.
Digital rectal examination revealed a mass in the region of left seminal vesicle separate from the prostate. The total leukocyte counts were within the normal limits, serum prostate specific antigen was 0.759 ng/ml and urine culture was sterile. Serum urea and creatinine values were 20 mg/dl (8-23 mg/dL) was 1 mg/dl (0.6-1.2 mg/dL), respectively. Repeat transabdominal and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) [] revealed a well-defined mass lesion, measuring 13.5 cm × 9.9 cm × 5.4 cm in size, posterior to the urinary bladder with homogeneous, hypoechoic echotexture in the region of left seminal vesicle. Prostate was normal in size and echotexture. There was moderate left hydroureteronephrosis with near normal renal parenchymal thickness and echotexture. The distal ureter was disappearing into the mass lesion. Computed tomography (CT) with contrast [Figure and ] revealed a mass with mixed cystic and solid densities in the location of left seminal vesicle. The lesion showed good post-contrast enhancement and no evidence of calcification. The terminal part of the left ureter appeared embedded within the mass lesion. The lesion was seen separate from the prostate and the left seminal vesicle wasn’t distinctly visible on the TRUS and the CT scans. Radiological opinion in view of the well-defined nature, solid-cystic, homogeneous and hypoechoic texture was that of a benign mass lesion. Since TRUS and CT gave adequate anatomical information of the lesion, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was not requested for, though that would have been the next logical step. Cystoscopy showed a trigonal bulge in the left side. Retrograde catheterization was not possible implying obstruction and or distortion of the juxtavesical ureter. Per-rectal fine needle aspiration of the mass yielded only blood and cytology of the same was inconclusive.
The lesion was explored through a lower midline incision on the abdomen. A huge mass lesion was encountered in the retrovesical location, obscuring the left seminal vesicle and involving the left ureter causing proximal dilatation. In the beginning ureter was liberated by meticulous dissection. This was followed by decompression of the tumor by scooping out of myxoid, jelly-like material after a capsulotomy. The capsule was carefully excised throughout taking care to preserve the neurovascular structure at the bladder neck. No separate seminal vesicle was made out at the culmination of tumor excision, suggesting that the former structure is the organ of origin. The right seminal vesicle was normal in appearance.
There were no post-operative complications and patient was discharged on 10th post-operative day. Histopathological examination revealed a benign schwannoma [] with degenerative changes such as foamy macrophages [] and cholesterol clefts [] and characteristic Verocay bodies []. Multiple sections did not reveal any seminal vesicle tissue within the tumor, suggesting that the tumor had completely effaced the organ. Patient was voiding well without incontinence and his erectile and ejaculatory functions are preserved. There has been no recurrence of tumor until date, that is, 2 years and 10 months after surgery.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 7-year-old girl presented with a 1-week history of swelling in the right anterior neck and submandibular area. Her past history and family history were noncontributary. Her growth pattern and development were also normal. Inspection of the neck revealed swellings in the right upper and left submandibular areas with no distortion of the overlying skin (). Physical examination revealed a fixed, hard, mildly tender pretracheal mass, 1.5x2.0 cm in size and another fixed, hard submandibular mass, 0.5x0.5 cm in size. There was no enlargement of the cervical lymph nodes. The remaining findings of the physical examination were unremarkable.
The masses were evaluated using ultrasonography (USG) and computed tomography (CT). USG examination revealed well-defined masses with heterogeneous echogenicity and the thyroid gland was not in the expected cervical location. Neck CT revealed aberrant thyroid tissue as a 1.3x2.3 cm, round-shaped, high-density mass in the right pretracheal area and another 1.4x1.6 cm mass with the same characteristics in the region of the tongue base (). A 99m-technetium pertechnetate thyroid scintigraphy was performed, which demonstrated two ectopic areas of uptake (upper anterior neck and lingual areas), confirming dual thyroid ectopia (). There was no uptake in the normal anatomical location of the thyroid gland. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of dual ectopic thyroid was made. Biochemical determinations were consistent with a state of subclinical hypothyroidism. Serum triiodothyronine level was 1.7 ng/mL (normal, 0.9-2.4 ng/mL); free thyroxine (fT4), 17.2 pmol/L (normal, 10-28 pmol/L) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level was 9.49 mIU/L (normal, 0.7-6.4 mIU/L).
Following the diagnosis, the patient was treated conservatively with oral levothyroxine, 0.05 mg per day. After treatment, she remained asymptomatic, the masses slightly decreased in size and repeated thyroid function tests were found to be within the normal limits.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"Post-mortem examination of a 15 + 2 deceased female foetus born to a 39-year-old healthy woman revealed isolated bilateral kidney agenesis. The father of the foetus was diagnosed with kidney hypoplasia and minimal change nephropathy at the age of 36 years due to persistent proteinuria. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperuricaemia, both requiring medical therapy. However, at the age of 53 years, kidney function was only mildly impaired. The father has a strong family history of kidney disease ().
DNA extracted from foetal tissue was analysed using array comparative genomic hybridization. No pathogenic genomic copy number variants were identified. Subsequently, a gene panel (including CAKUT genes BMP7, CDC5L, CHD1L, EYA1, FRAS1, FREM1, FREM2, GATA3, GREM1, GRIP1, HNF1B, ITGA8, PAX2, RET, ROBO2, SALL1, SIX2, SIX5 and TBX18) was targeted for sequencing to identify putative disease-associated variants using next-generation sequencing. Smaller indels, up to 50 bp, were called in the variant analysis pipeline, whereas exon deletion/duplications were analysed using a copy number variation tool. These analyses only identified a heterozygous PAX2 missense variant c.68T>C [p.(Leu23Pro)].
Subsequently, the PAX2 candidate variant was assessed for cosegregation with kidney phenotypes in the family under study. The variant was identified in all family members affected by kidney disease for which DNA was available (). The kidney phenotypes seen in the family were remarkably heterogeneous, including bilateral kidney agenesis, minimal change nephropathy, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, duplex kidney with hydronephrosis of upper pole system and bilateral kidney hypoplasia with end-stage renal failure in early adult life or with only moderate chronic kidney failure in late adult life.
To study whether the severe foetal phenotype was exacerbated by additional variants in modifier genes, an additional 138 genes previously associated with kidney disease were analysed, including GREB1L, FGF20 and LMX1B. No additional candidate variants were identified.

"A 53-year-old female was blue lighted into our emergency department resuscitation room by ambulance crew as she appeared extremely cyanotic from face to feet. She complained of nausea, vomiting and difficulty in breathing. Her most striking feature was a bluish hue of her face (Fig. ) including her lips and forearms. She looked as if she had fallen onto blue ink and had some residual staining. However, closer examination revealed that this discolouration was present throughout, including her nails (Fig. ). Oxygen therapy had made no difference to her appearance. She appeared confused and was unable to give any coherent history.
She was tachycardic (130/min) and tachypnoeic (30/min), and had a SpO2 of 90% on 15 l oxygen; blood pressure was 100/50 mmHg. Chest examination revealed few crackles in both mid zones, and a possible chemical/apsiration pneumonitis was suspected. She had a history of deliberate self harm. She had no allergies and worked as a beautician by profession.
Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis on oxygen showed pH 7.41 (7.35–7.45), pCO2 3.44 kPa (4.7–6), pO2 31.6 kPa (11–13 on room air), lactate 11.0 (<2), base excess −7.2 mmol/l (−2–+2) and HCO3 19.4 mmol/l (24–31). The patient continued to receive high-flow oxygen and intravenous access was gained, and bloods tests, including paracetomol and salicylate levels, and a urine toxicology for the usual drugs of abuse were requested. These subsequently turned out to be negative. She was treated with intravenous crystalloids for compensated metabolic acidosis and treated with antibiotics to cover for aspiration pneumonia. A differential diagnosis for high anion gap metabolic acidosis was worked out using the common mnemonic (MUD PILES—Methanol, Uremia, Diabetic ketoacidosis, Paraldehyde, Iron, Lactic acid, Ethanol and ethylene glycol, and Salicylates, respectively) as the anion gap was 21 (3–11). Despite her treatment, there was no sign of improvement. The initial chest x-ray was normal.
A diagnosis of methaemoglobinemia was suspected in our patient as she demonstrated (1) central cyanosis unresponsive to oxygen therapy with no previous history of congenital cardiac disease or causes for pulmonary hypertension; (2) decreased oxygen saturation on the pulse oximeter with a near normal pO2; (3) difference in the arterial blood gas (95%) and the pulse oximeter (90%) oxygen saturation measurements; and (4) she was a beautician with a history of self harm (beauty products when ingested can result in methaemoglobinaemia). An urgently requested methaemoglobin (MetHb) level showed a raised MetHb level (50.3%), which confirmed the diagnosis. She was subsequently treated with a slow intravenous dose of methylene blue (2 mg/kg). Clinical improvement was marked within 20 min. Her tachycardia and tachypnoea began to settle, and she was now able to communicate.
Her repeat ABG, 30 min post treatment, showed pH 7.37, pCO2 4.12, pO2 11.6, lactate 6.4, base excess −6.8, cHCO3 19.2 and MetHb 2.9%. She acknowledged the fact that she had consumed alcohol but refused to answer the deliberate self-harm questions. She was observed in a resuscitation room with regular ABG monitoring through an arterial line and then transferred to the intensive care unit where her recovery was complicated by the development of ARDS. ARDS was confirmed on a CT scan and was thought to be vasogenic or neurogenic in origin rather than aspiration or infective. She gradually improved and was eventually discharged from the hospital about 10 days later. Psychiatric counseling revealed that she had ingested a barbicide, and out-patient follow-up including chest clinic was arranged prior to discharge from the hospital. She was reviewed in the chest clinic for up to 3 months and had made an excellent recovery and did not have any ongoing respiratory symptoms, and hence was discharged from follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 63-year-old Caucasian male presented with a one-week history of uncontrolled choreiform movements of his left upper extremity. As described by the patient, his left arm began “jerking uncontrollably out of nowhere” while working in his shed at home. Prior to this development, the patient stated he had one similar episode a year ago which lasted for two days and resolved spontaneously. He did not seek evaluation at that time. His past medical history consisted of uncontrolled insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension, schizoaffective disorder, and polysubstance abuse in remission. He reported having diabetes mellitus for at least 10 years. Reviewing the medical records, his previous HbA1C readings ranged from 13.8% to 12.4% over a 12-month span prior to his admission. His average blood sugar readings over this time ranged from 300 to 350 mg/dl. BMI was 25.3 kg/m2. His home insulin regimen included 10 units of NovoLog three times a day with meals and Lantus 20 units every morning. He was not on any oral diabetic medications. The patient reported that he was not compliant with his home insulin medications. Notably for comparison, an MRI brain performed 5 months before for a fall did not reveal any abnormalities. He denied any recent medication changes, illnesses, or headaches. His ESR and CRP were elevated, and his initial glucose level was 339 mg/dl. HbA1C was 9.9% on the day of his admission. Vital signs were normal upon presentation, and physical exam was benign aside from the hemichorea movements of the left upper extremity. Our differential diagnosis included neoplastic disorders (metastatic brain disease and brain tumor), Huntington's disease, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, trauma, and drug or chemical toxicity (dopamine agonist or phenytoin). CT scan of the head showed areas of high density in the right lenticular nucleus and right caudate head. Subsequent precontrast MRI demonstrated T1 and T2 hyperintense abnormalities in the caudate nucleus portion of the right basal ganglia (). Postcontrast MRI of the brain showed no abnormal enhancement excluding the possibility of a mass lesion (). Diffusion-weighted MRI brain images did not reveal any abnormal restricted diffusion in the right basal ganglia which excluded ischemia (). All of these changes were consistent with the movement pattern he was displaying and with a diagnosis of CHBG. Other conditions that have been known to cause hyperintense imaging abnormalities on MRI such as this include various cellular respiratory toxins such as carbon monoxide, methanol, and cyanide. Leigh disease and hyperammonemia from chronic cirrhosis have also been known to cause this. Our patient did not have any history that would correlate with these alternative possibilities, and additionally, none of these alternatives have been known to present with hemichorea. Inpatient treatment consisted of restarting the patient's home insulin regimen with the addition of inpatient corrective coverage. This included Lantus 20 units every morning and 10 units of NovoLog 3 times a day with meals. The patient's symptoms eventually resolved with control of his blood sugar levels. Control was achieved over roughly 48 hours during which our patient's blood glucose levels dropped from an average of mid-300s to the 170–200 mg/dl range. The choreoathetosis progressed from continuous movements to intermittent and then finally to resolution.
Endocrinology was consulted for assistance with the patient's difficult glycemic control. During his posthospitalization outpatient course, our patient began to consistently adhere to his outpatient diabetic medications. Lantus was increased to 40 units every morning and NovoLog was increased 13 units 3 times a day with meals. His HbA1C 6 months after discharge had improved to 7.1%. There were no further occurrences of choreiform movements. This time course of events demonstrates how treatment of hyperglycemia can adequately treat and lead to complete resolution of hemichorea-hemiballismic movements in patients with CHBG. In this case, symptomatic improvement began being observed 48 hours after initiation of glucose control.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 45-year-old Caucasian female born to first-cousin parents, with two healthy children and without any relevant family history record of prior diseases, was seen at the service of Dermatology (University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal) in March 2014 because of persistent extensive, skin-colored, exuberant, and disfiguring warts in both feet and hands since the age of 10 years (). Warts were refractory to treatment with keratolytic agents, cryosurgery, and excision, with minor improvement after treatment with acitretin in association with topical 50% urea cream. Apart from this, the patient did not describe recurrent infection-related episodes or diseases, except for past medical history of measles and mumps during her infancy and varicella infection during her first pregnancy, which all resolved without complications. Of note, such past history of infections is not rare among the patient age-matched Portuguese population since vaccination for these diseases was introduced in the Portuguese national vaccination program years after she was born (1969): in 1974 for measles, in 1987 for mumps, and in 2004 for varicella (–). In fact, outbreaks of measles and mumps have been reported in Portugal until the late 80s to mid-90s, with peaks of >10,000 cases per year (, ).
In addition, she referred allergic rhino-conjunctivitis treated with cetirizine and fluticasone, and chronic polyarthralgias in the absence of impaired functionality. Serological studies were negative for (severe) infections, including HIV 1/2, HTLV-1, and syphilis. In turn, she showed IgG antibodies for ubiquitous pathogens including CMV >250 arbitrary units (AU/ml) (positive threshold >6AU/ml) and Epstein–Barr virus VCA = 192 U/ml (positive threshold >20 U/ml) and EBNA = 24 U/ml (positive threshold >20 U/ml) in the absence of serum IgM antibodies for these pathogens (0.06 AU/ml; positive threshold >6AU/ml). Slightly increased serum IgG levels (IgG: 1,430 mg/dl), associated with normal IgA (278 mg/dl), IgM (67 mg/dl), C3 (1.4 g/L), C4 (0.33 g/L), and C1 inhibitor (0.318 g/L) serum levels, were detected. In addition, anti-neutrophil and anti–double-strand DNA autoantibodies were negative, while antinuclear autoantibodies were weakly positive. Screening for immunological alterations by flow cytometry () (–) using the EuroFlow Primary Immunodeficiency Orientation Tube (PIDOT) (, ) showed an absolute defect of CD4-expressing T-cells (<0.01 cells/μl), with normal total T-cell, CD8+ TCRγδ− T-cell, and NK-cell (absolute) numbers, associated with consistently increased B-cell counts vs. age-matched normal reference values. Importantly, (TCRαβ+ TCRγδ−) DN T-cells were significantly expanded ().

"An 88-year old woman presented with epigastric pain, nausea and hematemesis for the last 2 days, with a recurrent history of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and progressive food intolerance. She had a history of well-controlled hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Physical exam upon arriving to the emergency department revealed mild abdominal distention, with non-radiating epigastric pain, without rebound tenderness or guarding, while the rest of the physical exam was normal. EKG did not reveal any abnormalities. A chest X-ray showed clear lungs with a left thoracic opacity suggestive of a large hiatal hernia. The patient was admitted and an emergency upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed due to persisting hematemesis, showing a mild gastritis with a bleeding mucosal lesion in the migrated stomach body that was treated with hemoclips. Barium upper gastrointestinal series showed half the gastric body above the diaphragm in the right thorax, while the Gastro-oesophageal junction was also herniating into the chest, suggesting a type III mixed PEH. The distal oesophagus had a tortuous appearance, suggestive of a probable motor dysfunction. An abdominal CT-scan with IV injection confirmed the diagnosis of incomplete gastric volvulus associated with the PEH (). Due to persistent epigastric pain and food intolerance, the patient underwent a laparoscopic trans-hiatal hernia and volvulus reduction, with total excision of the hernia sac. Due to the patient’s advanced age and comorbidities, we performed a posterior cruroplasty without mesh reinforcement, associated to an anterior gastropexy with continuous running suture with barbed non-resorbable 2/0, anchoring 3/4th of the stomach to the anterolateral abdominal muscles (). The patient tolerated the procedure very well, and had an uneventful 5 days hospital stay with progressive mixed diet. She was seen at 1 and 6 months of follow-up, confirming the complete resolution of her abdominal symptoms, without GERD and a much better food tolerance.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 73-year-old right-handed AA woman with a known history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease presented to the UAB emergency room with shortness of breath, lower extremity edema, and confusion. There was no travel history, and contact exposure to COVID-19 was unknown. A significant past neurological history included surgical repair of left frontal skull base ethmoidal encephalocele and ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus. At presentation, she had an axillary temperature of 90.6 F, heart rate of 44 beats per minute, blood pressure of 86/71 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. There was no focal neurological weakness or neck stiffness, but she had diminished level of consciousness. Chest X-ray demonstrated patchy bilateral opacities and serum procalcitonin (0.53 ng/mL) was elevated. She was admitted to the intensive care unit with the diagnosis of sepsis. The next morning, bedside nurses noticed persistent face and arm myoclonus with worsening altered mental status that was concerning for status epilepticus. Scalp EEG showed marked background voltage attenuation and slowing, continuous 0.5-0.75 Hz bilateral independent periodic discharges (BIPDs) over the left and right hemisphere that evolved to form recurrent (approx. 5/hour) discrete seizures emanating from either right or left fronto-central-parietal regions (Figs. , ). Myoclonic status epilepticus with coma (MSE) was diagnosed and treated with intravenous levetiracetam, lacosamide, phenytoin, and midazolam to achieve burst suppression for 48 hours. Four days later, the EEG improved significantly with the cessation of epileptiform activity. However, clinically she worsened with multi-organ failure requiring blood transfusions and hemodialysis. Tracheal aspirate tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Due to a strict isolation policy to minimize the spread of COVID-19, the MRI brain was not obtained. Instead, a CT brain and perfusion study were performed a day after the MSE ceased, and it did not reveal any abnormality that could explain the etiology of MSE. For the next 3 weeks, multiple attempts to arouse or extubate failed after sedatives were held. Care was withdrawn, and the patient expired.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 70-year-old male, with history of hypertension, dislipidemia, and hyperuricemia, presented to our institution with a one-year long history of progressive and intense lower lumbar pain causing great limitation of daily activities. Physiotherapy or medication was ineffective. The patient reported a palpable mass on this region for years but with neither symptoms nor size progression. He had no constitutional or neurologic symptoms. On examination, there were tenderness over the central and left paraspinal area and a fixed palpable mass of size approximately 7 × 5 cm, hard in consistency, and no pulse. The pain aggravated with flexion, extension, and rotational trunk movements. Neurologic examination was normal. Radiographs showed a bony mass protruding posteriorly, apparently from the L5 vertebra. CT scan showed a 7 cm long well-limited mass with an apparent cartilage cap arising from the spinous process of L5. It was lateralized to the left with adjacent paraspinal muscle compression (). Under general anesthesia, the tumor was marginally resected along with the L5 spinous process through a posterior approach (). Histologic examination has shown a specimen composed of trabecular bone with focus on bone marrow covered by lobules of cartilaginous tissue, without cellular atypia, consistent with osteochondroma (). After surgery pain was completely relieved, and neurologic function was normal. At one-year follow-up there was no evidence of local recurrence or symptoms.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 73-year-old man had a past operative history of ruptured colonic diverticulitis treated by Hartmann’s procedure in 2007, and perforated peptic ulcer treated by pyloroplasty in 2009. He suffered from abdominal and tarry stool for 5 days in March 2011, so he was admitted to a rural hospital for further survey and medication. An initial upper GI endoscopy showed gastric ulcer only, but hypotension with tachycardia and a drop in hemoglobin of 9 g/dl from 12 g/dl occurred the next day. Intravenous fluid and blood transfusion with packed red blood cell were prescribed. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with rupture was highly suspected, so CTA of aorta (Fig. ) was carried out which disclosed an AAA with swollen bowel loop. He was transferred to our emergency department (ED) for consideration of vascular surgical intervention.
On arrival in our ED, vital signs were a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per min, a heart rate of 130 beats per min, a blood pressure of 98/73 mmHg, and a body temperature of 35.6 °C. Physical examination revealed a pale conjunctiva, no heart murmur, clear breathing sound, old operative scar over middle abdomen, and hypoactive bowel sound with tenderness over the periumbilical region. Leukocytosis, anemia, abnormal liver profiles, and metabolic acidosis were found. Laboratory investigations were summarized in Table .
A cardiovascular surgeon carried out emergent angiography of aorta, which depicted bleeding from the wall of the AAA and chronic total occlusion of the left external iliac artery, so a modified aorto-uni-iliac stent graft (Fig. ) was implanted with femoral-to-femoral bypass, which underwent smoothly. A general surgeon performed exploratory laparotomy and found a massive blood clot with a volume of about 1310 ml filling the entire lumen of the small intestine, a dilated and swollen duodenum about 6 cm in diameter with ecchymosis, and a fistula about 2x2cm over the third portion of the duodenum (Fig. ). Duodenostomy with primary closure for repair of fistula defect, partition of the duodenum between the 2nd and 3rd portions, and side-to-side gastrojejunostomy were completed smoothly. He was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit for postoperative care. CTA of aorta showed neither endoleakage nor intraabdominal abscess on postoperative day 17. He was discharged without complications and returned for follow up at the out-of-patient department on postoperative day 25.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"The patient was a 30 year-old male who was exposed to phosgene twelve hours prior to admission to a local clinic complaining of dyspnea, coughing and sputum. Auscultation of the chest revealed coarse breath sound with crackles all over the lung fields. A chest X-ray showed bilateral diffuse interstitial infiltration. The WBC were 12.3 × 103/μl. Arterial blood gases were PaO2, 50.2 mmHg, PaCO2, 37.2 mmHg, pH, 7.401. The patient was transferred to CNUH with worsening dyspnea. The vital signs on admission were blood pressure 130/70 mmHg, pulse 89/min, respiration 28/min and temperature 36.5°C. The WBC were 18.0 × 103/μl with 98% neutrophils. The LDH was 350 unit. Initial blood gas determinations on room air were, PaO2, 55.3 mmHg, PaCO2, 26.7 mmHg. pH, 7.477. Twelve hours after admission, the patient began to have progressively increasing respiratory symptoms with the respiratory rate rising to 55/min. The patient was intubated and ventilated with controlled mode. Ventilation was maintained with diazepam and vecuronium and treated with methylprednisolone and aminophylline. Three hours after ventilation, the fraction of inspired oxygen could be reduced to 0.6. After 24 hours of ventilation with 6 cmH2O PEEP, he developed subcutaneous emphysema extending into the neck and anterior chest. The PEEP could be reduced and subcutaneous emphysema and arterial oxygenation did not get-worse. On the third day, the patient could be weaned from the ventilator and extubated. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone, aminophylline and antibiotics. Pulmonary function tests were performed on the fifth day following exposure and showed a restrictive pattern and a normal diffusion capacity ().
The three other patients exposed to phosgene were transferred to CNUH and all were in their early forties. Their complaints were also shortness of breath, chest tightness without derangements of vital signs and arterial blood gases. The pertinent findings in the physical examination were bilateral crackles over the lung fields and diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest X-ray.
They were treated with supplemental oxygen by external devices, methylprednisolone, aminophylline and antibiotics. Their symptoms were gradually improved in 3 to 5 days of supportive care.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 13-year-old girl presented with a history of abdominal distension, back ache, and loss of appetite and weight of 3 months’ duration. Her medical history was otherwise unremarkable. On examination, an ill-defined mass of 10 cm × 8 cm size was palpable in the right hypochondrial region, extending 7 cm below the right costal margin and medially up to the umbilical region. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed a large, heterogeneous mass of 18 cm × 16 cm × 16 cm size arising from the right adrenal, infiltrating the right lobe of liver, and displacing the right kidney inferolaterally.
Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the adrenal mass showed clusters of malignant cells forming rosettes in an eosinophilic fibrillary background with high nuclear cytoplasmic ratio. In addition, scattered ganglion cells with eccentric-placed nuclei and prominent nucleoli were also present and features were consistent with ganglioneuroblastoma [].
The 24-h urinary vanillyl mandelic acid VMA level was 5.4 mg/24 h (normal is < 7 mg/24 h). Radiography of the lumbo-sacral spine showed mixed lytic and sclerotic lesion involving the L3 vertebrae [] and confirmed by computed tomography (CT) soft tissue with bone window []. To assess the extent of neuroblastoma and metastasis, PET-CT was done. It showed [Figures and ] increased uptake in the right adrenal and liver areas with metastatic involvement of L3 vertebrae. These imaging findings and FNAC reflected the diagnosis of ganglioneuroblastoma; stage IV (vertebral and liver metastasis).

"A 77-year-old man was admitted to our department after developing a fever and backache. Based on CT findings (Figure ) and laboratory test results, pyelonephritis was initially suspected. Antibiotic therapy improved his symptoms and laboratory indicators of inflammation. One year later, he complained of backache. CT revealed a progressively enlarging renal lesion, multiple liver masses, enlargement of the para-aortic lymph nodes, and multiple osteoblastic and osteoclastic lesions (Figure ). A renal tumor with multiple metastases was suspected considering the clinical course and imaging findings retrospectively. At the time, TCC was suspected, which later proved to be a misdiagnosis. MVAC therapy was given without effect, and 1 year later the patient died of cardiac failure that was unrelated to the treatment. On autopsy, the primary tumor was found to be a collecting duct carcinoma, and liver, right adrenal gland, right upper ureter, bone marrow, para-aortic and mediastinal lymph node, and bone metastases were found.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 70-year-old female patient without a history of smoking presented with a subcutaneous tumor in the left thigh. Positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) scans revealed a 4.0 × 4.2-cm mass in the upper left lung lobe and multiple muscular and bone metastatic lesions (Figure ). She was diagnosed with stage IVB cancer (T2bN0M1c). Her performance status was 1 and serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was 18.6 (normal range, 0–5.0) ng/ml.
Pathological examination of the resected subcutaneous tumor in the left thigh revealed moderately differentiated SCC with cornification (Figure ). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed diffuse and strongly positive staining for pan-cytokeratin, cytokeratin 5/6, and p40, although the cells were negative for thyroid transcription factor-1, CK7, napsin A, and CD56 (Figure ). The tumor expressed wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) based on the molecular analysis of exons 18–21 and was diffusely and strongly positive (3+) for ALK by intercalated antibody-enhanced immunohistochemistry with an ALK detection kit (Nichirei Bioscience; Figure ). Based on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using break-apart probes for ALK (Figure ), the patient was diagnosed with SCC harboring EML4-ALK rearrangement and treated with alectinib (300 mg twice daily). Two months later, PET-CT images revealed dramatic shrinkage in the size of primary tumor in the left upper lung lobe and reduction in the size of multiple muscular, bone, and skin metastases (Figure ); therefore, the patient was considered to have achieved partial response to alectinib according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors guidelines (version 1.1). Although she experienced recurrence after a durable response of 9.5 months, there were no severe alectinib-related adverse events.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 46-year-old male visited the emergency department of our hospital on April 23, 2015 due to fever and headache for three days and impaired memory for half a day. The patient had experienced fever three days before, with a peak body temperature of 38.5 °C. No other discomfort was described. He had visited other hospitals before and was diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection based on haematological findings. However, his condition did not improve after treatment with intravenous levofloxacin. Within a half a day, he developed impaired memory, concomitant with speech disturbance, poor response, no significant limb movements and convulsions before being referred to the emergency department of our hospital. The patient had no medical history. No histories of food and drug allergies were obtained. The patient denied any prior history of smoking, heavy drinking or drug abuse. On arrival, the initial physical examination revealed the following: body temperature 38.0 °C, pulse 100 beats/min, respirations 26 breaths/min, blood pressure 144/76 mmHg, delirium, speech disturbance, equal size and round shape of bilateral pupils with diameters of approximately 3.0 mm, sensitive to light reflex, basically normal cranial nerve examination, limb muscle strength Grade V, negative bilateral pathological signs, and no ataxia. The patient’s neck was soft, and there were no signs of meningeal irritation. No significant findings were found on the cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations. No skin rashes or bleeding sites were observed after examining the entire body. The laboratory test results were the following: haematology: white blood cells (WBC), 12.5 × 109/L, neutrophil percentage, 87.6%; C-reactive protein (CRP), 56 mg/L; procalcitonin (PCT), 2.8 ng/mL; and D-dimer, 3.2 μg/mL. A chemistry panel and screens for infectious diseases and cardiac markers were generally normal. No abnormal findings were observed on chest X-ray or electrocardiogram. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed a curved high-density mass at the left sylvian fissure area and an ischemic lesion of the left temporal lobe (Fig. ).
As an emergency diagnosis, massive cerebral infarction (probable atherosclerosis of the left internal carotid artery system) was considered, and intracranial infection could not be excluded; appropriate treatments included aspirin for anti-platelet aggregation, atorvastatin for lipid regulation and plaque stabilization, and cefuroxime and acyclovir for anti-infection.
The patient experienced aggravated unconsciousness after two hours of admission, and physical examination showed the following: lethargy, aphasia, equal size and round shape of bilateral pupils with diameters of approximately 3.0 mm, sensitive to light reflex, shallow right nasolabial folds, immobilization of right limbs upon orbital pressure, movable left limbs, positive right pathological signs and negative left pathological signs. Further revascularization therapy was considered, and the patient was immediately transferred to undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). On the way to the radiology department, the patient experienced further aggravation of unconsciousness and entered a light coma, concomitant with limb seizure, gazing to the left of bilateral eyes, equal size and round shape of bilateral pupils with diameters of approximately 2.0 mm, and disappearance of the light reflex. Appropriate treatments included midazolam for epilepsy, mannitol for dehydration and intracranial hypotension. After termination of the seizure, re-examination of the brain CT showed a curved high-density mass at the left sylvian fissure area and a massive low-density area in the left temporal lobe with many high-density plot areas scattered within it. CT images also showed compressed deformation of the left ventricle and a shift of the brain midline to the right (Fig. ). Considering that the patient developed haemorrhagic transformation, he was admitted to the emergency intensive care unit for further management.
Eighteen hours after admission, the patient experienced further aggravation of unconsciousness and entered a moderate coma, concomitant with high fever (body temperature 39.9 °C), bilateral pupils: left versus right = 5.0 mm versus 3.0 mm, respectively, disappearance of the light reflex, increased muscle tone of the right limbs, and positive pathological signs of bilateral limbs. The brain CT re-examination showed expansion of the bleeding area, with overt signs of brain herniation. The patient underwent emergency left frontal temporal craniotomy, removal of the intracranial hematoma and a decompressed craniotomy performed by neurosurgeons. The intraoperative findings were as follows: dark red appearance of the left temporal brain tissue, concomitant with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH); an ostomy of approximately 0.2 cm was created along the left temporal sulcus; a visible purple blood clot was observed, concomitant with surrounding contused brain tissues; and a large vascular embolization could be observed in the hematoma cavity. Approximately 10 mL of the hematoma and contused brain tissues were removed and sampled for pathological evaluation. Histopathological examination showed haemorrhage, oedema and inflammatory changes in brain tissues, neutrophil infiltration into the vascular walls and surrounding tissues, and microvascular purulent thrombosis (Figs. –). The patient was transferred to the neurologic intensive care unit for further treatment after the operation. During the course of the treatment, negative findings were found for Chlamydia pneumoniae, mycopsslasma, influenza, tuberculosis, the TORCH panel, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); the sputum culture was negative, and the blood culture suggested Staphylococcus aureus. No abnormal findings were found on chest X-ray or ultrasound. In addition, two transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) examinations were normal, and there were no observations of valvular dysfunction or neoplasm. The following final diagnosis was considered: massive cerebral infarction, consistent with haemorrhagic transformation (the left internal carotid artery system, inflammatory thrombus), Staphylococcus aureus sepsis and symptomatic epilepsy. After two months of vancomycin anti-infective treatments and supportive and symptomatic treatment, the consciousness of the patient improved gradually, and several blood cultures were negative. He underwent rehabilitation and was discharged from the hospital on the 72nd postoperative day (POD). At discharge, his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was E4V4M6, and the modified Rankin scale score was 3.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 78-year-old male presented with chief complaint of chronic and worsening left hip pain. Relevant history included an intertrochanteric hip fracture that had been treated one year prior with a cephalomedullary nail. Prior to hip fracture, the patient could walk without any assistive devices and was a high-functioning community ambulatory. Following the injury, the patient was limited to ambulation with the assistance of a walker. On physical examination, the left leg was significantly shorter than the right leg. Range of motion revealed an extremely limited range of the hip and impingement testing was positive. Infectious workup was negative for an infectious source. Neurological testing was unremarkable. Radiographs of the pelvis were obtained and demonstrated a hip fracture with a non-union of the intertrochanteric region of the femur, as well as penetration of the head screw through the femoral head. There was also screw penetration into the acetabulum and an LLD radiographically measured at 45 mm (Table ).
The preoperative plan included left hip THA. During surgery, computer-assisted navigation was used to assist with component placement and monitoring of changes in leg length. Intraoperative navigation measurements indicated a lengthening of 35 mm, which was confirmed on post-operative radiographs. Surgery was successful and the patient progressed well, experiencing significant pain relief and satisfaction with his surgery. He was discharged to home with a walker and within six weeks of follow-up, the patient had transitioned to walking with only a cane. At three months the patient was no longer using any assistive walking devices and at one year follow-up the patient was pain free and returned to his previous level of function prior to the hip fracture. Radiographs revealed that the left hip was well-aligned, with the left leg lengthened by 35 mm for a significantly improved post-operative LLD of 10 mm (Table , Figure ).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

He had employed topical hydrocortisone and other non-specified topical treatments for 2 months. He referred erythema, a burning sensation, and pain in the scrotum. Clinical examination revealed bright-red erythema in the scrotum. No clinical signs or suggestive symptoms of contact dermatitis were noted. The patient had suspended topical treatment 2 months before evaluation. Because of the low-suspicion of contact dermatitis, patch test was considered not appropriate at the time.

"The patient in our case was a 51-year-old man who had been treated 20 years ago with ascending-to-descending EABG using a 22-mm Dacron graft for CoA. Moreover, he had anatomical anomalies of the right aortic arch with Kommerell’s diverticulum. Eight years ago, the patient experienced hemoptysis due to a PA on the distal anastomosis site and was treated by TEVAR using the GORE TAG Stent Graft System (34 mm × 20 cm) (W.L. Gore & Associated, Inc., Flagstaff, AZ, USA). After TEVAR, the size of the PA decreased, and the patient did not experience hemoptysis.
However, due to a recurrence of hemoptysis, the patient was admitted to a hospital. On admission, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed the presence of a PA in the distal anastomotic site of the graft, which appeared to be the cause of hemoptysis (Fig. ). The stent graft was observed in the distal anastomotic site, as was massive blood flow from the descending aorta. Therefore, the patient was transferred to our institution. Blood pressure was normal on examination, and we initially planned to treat the patient using TEVAR. The stent graft is ideally deployed from a site distal to the coarctation to cover the PA, but in this case, it could not be placed proximally to the PA owing to the anatomical form. Thus, we decided to replace the descending aorta and subsequently performed end-to-side anastomosis of the replaced descending aorta with the graft that was surgically constructed 20 years ago.
The patient underwent a right third intercostal thoracotomy. Because large portions of the lung had adhered to the ascending-to-descending EABG and PA, we modified the initial surgical plan to perform replacement of the descending aorta, followed by end-to-side anastomosis of the graft to the newly replaced descending aorta. The native descending aorta proximal to the anastomosis site was accessible; therefore, we decided to completely transect the descending aorta for decompression of the PA (Fig. ). The descending aorta was clamped between the coarctation and PA and transected. Both sides were closed using 4-0 polypropylene with pledget (ETHICON®). Postoperative contrast-enhanced CT showed the complete disappearance of the diseased aortic arch, including the ruptured PA (Fig. ). The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was transferred back to the previous hospital on the 13th postoperative day to continue rehabilitation. The patient is doing very well at 5 months after the surgery.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 38-year-old married female without any past or family history of psychiatric or neurological illness and with good premorbid functioning. She was harboring delusion of infidelity against her husband along with disturbed socio-occupational and biological functioning for the past 6 years. There was no history of substance use disorders, except excessive caffeine use, or any high risk sexual behavior. Organic psychiatric disorder or symptoms of schizophrenia were not evident. Detailed general physical examination including neurological evaluation did not reveal any abnormality except mild pallor. She reported regular menstruation and the last childbirth was 10 years back. Mental status examination revealed that she was having an uncooperative and aggressive attitude, delusion of infidelity, impaired judgment, and lack of insight. So, she was admitted to psychiatry ward with a diagnosis of persistent delusional disorder as per International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition. She was started on intramuscular olanzapine 10 mg/day. On investigation, her complete hemogram revealed a Hb of 11.5 gms/dL and a serum ferritin level of 30.2 ngm/ml (normal value for females is 10-291 ng/mL). Other routine hematological and biochemical parameters including blood sugar, renal, liver, and thyroid function were within normal limits. We also planned a vitamin B12 and folic acid estimation which could not be done due to lack of resources.
Within 4-5 days of starting olanzapine, there was a decrease in her aggression and she became cooperative for interviewing. However, she would report that she was having sleeping difficulty due to an itching sensation in both upper and lower limbs at night. She would rub her legs against bedclothes, tie pieces of cloth around her limbs, and ask for limb massage to get relief from such a discomfort. She would have such symptoms for hours after lying down at night. During daytime, she would, however, feel comfortable, relaxed, and was able to sleep. She was evaluated for sleep disorder-before this she never had any sleep complaint, neither was there any family history of sleep disorder. During sleep, there was no history of snoring, no abnormal limb or breathing movements. Ear, nose, throat examination was also noncontributory. She was having a thin built and a body mass index of 15.56. As she became cooperative, she was shifted to oral psychotropics (olanzapine 15 mg/day + clonazepam 1 mg at bedtime). Also oral iron supplementation in the form of ferrous fumarate 350 mg, vitamin B12, and ascorbic acid was started. To improve her sleep, general sleep hygiene practices were initiated, she was prohibited from taking any caffeine beverages at night and the clonazepam was further increased up to 2 mg at bedtime. But there was no improvement in her nighttime symptoms.
In view of her above symptoms and investigations, she was diagnosed to have RLS with an International Restless Legs Scale Score (IRLS) of 24 indicating high severity and olanzapine was considered to be the probable cause. Hence, the olanzapine was decreased to 10 mg/day and oral risperidone 2 mg was added at bedtime. On the next day, the severity of symptoms decreased to a RLS score of 12. No other change in medication was done during this period. So, after 2 days, olanzapine was stopped and risperidone was increased to 6 mg at bedtime. Thereafter, her troublesome symptoms ceased completely. Though she still harbored the delusions yet the conviction decreased and she became more cooperative with her husband and the treating clinician. Then after about a week of uneventful ward stay, she was discharged free of her sleep-related difficulties on risperidone 6 mg and clonazepam 1 mg at bedtime with the plan to continue her antipsychotic drugs and iron supplementation on an outpatient basis.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 62-year-old, white, Caucasian, British-origin, male lorry driver was admitted to the hospital late on a Friday night after an unwitnessed single vehicle road accident. His lorry was by the side of the road and he was found unconscious in the vehicle and immediately transferred to the local District General Hospital. On admission, he had already fully recovered, being alert and orientated but he had no recollection of the accident. He was haemodynamically stable, with normal vital signs and no neurological deficit. He complained only at a moderate headache. Physical examination has revealed a bruise on the upper part of his left anterior chest wall, left shoulder and forehead. The rest of the examination was entirely normal. The radiological investigation that followed included cervical spine and left arm X-rays in which no fracture was noted. A mobile AP chest X-ray was also done on admission, in which it was demonstrated a dilated aortic arch (). A subarachnoid hemorrhage was found on a moderate quality brain CT-scan (), which was attributed to traumatic brain injury and the patient was transferred to the regional Neurosurgical centre as a post-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage for observation. During the next two days, the patient was well without any neurological defect and he has been gradually mobilized without any major complaint. On Monday however, brain CT interpretation by a more senior member of the medical staff suggested that this may not be a post-traumatic but rather an aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A CT angiogram confirmed that his SAH was of aneurismal origin, due to the rupture of an anterior communicating artery (Acom) aneurysm () which was the actual reason for his accident. As the patient was neurologically intact and stable, an embolisation procedure for endovascular treatment of this aneurysm was decided for the following day (day 5 since the SAH event). Under general anesthesia, the right common femoral artery was punctured and a 6F appropriate vascular sheath was placed following our protocol for endovascular procedures. During the first attempt to catheterize the aortic arch for the standard pre-embolisation angiogram, an unusual dilatation of the thoracic descending aorta was noted, just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. The combination of these findings with the bruise in the upper left chest, made us suspicious of an aortic injury. The embolisation procedure was abandoned and an aortogram revealed an aortic dissection just distal to the left subclavian origin (). The patient was woken up and a chest CT followed, which confirmed the diagnosis of a post-traumatic dissection of the descending aorta. Subsequently, he was transferred to the cardio-thoracic unit and an aortic stent was successfully deployed for endovascular repair of the dissection (). He had an uneventful recovery and two weeks later, endovascular treatment of his Acom aneurysm was performed with platinum coils (). At the same time, a posttraumatic dissection aneurysm of the right common carotid artery (CCA) at its cervical segment was also found (). This was clinically silent, treated conservatively at that stage [] and the patient was eventually discharged three weeks after the primary event. At the six month follow-up, the patient had made a very good recovery and returned to full activities. The aortic dissection was not visible anymore in imaging but there was a recurrence of the previous coiled Acom aneurysm due to coil compaction. Thus, a new embolisation procedure with platinum coils was performed to treat this aneurysm recurrence. At the same stage, the right CCA dissection aneurysm was endovascularly treated using platinum coils, as it showed no signs of regression [,].","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"This is a 16-year-old boy with compound heterozygote mutations LDLR c.131G>A and c.2043C>A and a history of HeFH in both parents (LDL-C levels at 271 mg/dL and 387 mg/dL). The patient has carotid plaques occluding 25–30% of the carotid lumina, but with no impairment of perfusion. The patient was diagnosed with HoFH at the age of 9 years with Achilles’ xanthomata and LDL-C levels at 900 mg/dL. LLT with rosuvastatin 20 mg/day, ezetimibe 10 mg/day and weekly apheresis was started, with dietary modifications to reduce fat intake to 15% of total energy. On this regimen, mean interval LDL-C levels reduced to 206 mg/dL.
As the patient got older, issues with schooling meant that there was a desire to extend the LA interval to biweekly. This change was made, and evolocumab 420 mg Q2W was added to the background LLT. However, as a result of the mutation profile of the patient, evolocumab did not work (mean interval LDL-C 329 mg/dL), and the decision was taken to prescribe lomitapide. The patient was commenced on lomitapide at 5 mg/day with escalation to 15 mg/day over 3 months (Fig. ). Apheresis was stopped, lomitapide was increased to 20 mg, rosuvastatin was increased to 40 mg and ezetimibe doses were maintained. LDL-C levels remained at approximately 190 mg/dL for more than 6 months and therefore lomitapide was increased to 30 mg/day and rosuvastatin reduced to 35 mg/day. Figure shows that LDL-C levels continued to rise after commencement of lomitapide, followed by a subsequent marked decrease. There is no direct explanation for this other than the cessation of apheresis.
Mean interval LDL-C levels are now at 34.8 mg/dL (a remarkable 85.7% decrease), with no LA currently ongoing. Early GI issues resolved. There were no other adverse events, other than slightly depressed alkaline phosphatase levels. Alanine aminotransferase briefly increased by more than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) on two occasions, and reduced to less than three times the ULN without intervention. All other laboratory parameters remain normal and there is no evidence of hepatic steatosis.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 44-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital complaining of a large tumor that had been accidentally pointed out in a medical examination as being an esophageal submucosal tumor. Relevant family history brought to light that his father had been diagnosed as having MEN1. Our patient had undergone total parathyroidectomy and autologous transplantation for primary hyperparathyroidism at the age of 18. His height and weight were 187 cm and 120 kg, respectively, with a body mass index of 34 kg/m2 on admission. He also complained of sleep apnea and bilateral nipple discharge. He was not aware of the hypoglycemic symptoms before the admission, but he frequently encountered the symptoms under nutritional management after the admission. Laboratory data of blood chemistry were normal as well as the tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9, whereas neuron specific γ-enolase was high (19.1 ng/ml). Hormonal examinations revealed a hypoglycemia, a hyperinsulinemia (fasting serum glucose, insulin levels, and hemoglobin A1c, 76 mg/dl, 134.5 μU/ml, and 4.5 %, respectively), a hyperprolactinemia (serum prolactin level 871.2 ng/ml), and elevated urinary catecholamines. On an enhanced thin-slice abdominal computed tomography (CT), a large tumor was detected in the pancreatic tail, showing heterogeneous enhancement with partial calcification and cystic components. Its maximum diameter was about 18 cm (Fig., ). Other than a pancreatic tail tumor, six enhanced liver tumors, a right adrenal tumor (3.9 cm in diameter), and a left adrenal tumor (2.6 cm in diameter) were found (Fig. , ). The right adrenal tumor was heterogeneously enhanced. An endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) revealed four tumors in the body and tail of the pancreas, except for the giant tumor, and abundant blood flow in all these tumors. Immunohistochemical examinations of a EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy showed that the giant pancreatic tumor and liver tumors were positive for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and CD56; thus, the tumors were diagnosed as being a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) and its liver metastases. They were NET G1 as the labeling index of Ki67 was 1.8 %. A calcium gluconate injection into the distal splenic artery during a selective intra-arterial calcium injection test resulted in a marked increase in serum insulin and C-peptide. Both 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy and 131I-adosterol scintigraphy showed high radioactivity in the right adrenal tumor and no radioactivity in the left one. The left adrenal tumor was therefore diagnosed as having a non-functional adenoma. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified a heterogeneous pituitary adenoma, 3.1 cm in diameter.
His pedigree diagram is shown in Fig. . Five patients with MEN1, including our patient who has an MEN1 gene mutation, were identified within his family. Furthermore, the genetic examination revealed a deletion mutation (g.249_252delGTCT) at codons 83–84 in exon 2. He underwent distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, cholecystectomy, right adrenalectomy, abdominal subcutaneous tumor excision, and cutaneous tumor biopsy for the purpose of tumor volume reduction. Six tumors in the resected pancreas were diagnosed as being pancreatic NETs. The giant tumor in the pancreatic tail was insulinoma, and NET G2 as the Ki67 labeling index was 4.2 % (Fig. ). Of the other five lesions, two tumors consisted of the insulin-positive tumor cells with less than 0.1 % of the Ki67 index, and three tumors consisted of the glucagon-positive tumor cells with less than 0.1 % of the Ki67 index. These tumors were diagnosed as being non-functional NET G1 because no symptom due to a glucagon excess was encountered. A non-functional adrenal cortical adenoma, measuring 1.3 cm in maximum diameter, and a pheochromocytoma, measuring 4.7 cm in maximum diameter, coexisted in the right adrenal gland (Fig. ). The abdominal subcutaneous tumor was found to be a neurofibroma, and the cutaneous tumor was a fibroma.
During the postoperative outpatient follow-up, he developed diabetes mellitus and required treatment with an oral antidiabetic drug. For the treatment of his pituitary prolactinoma, cabergoline was administered. Octreotide therapy for the multiple liver metastases of the NETs began 2 months after the operation. After the ninth administration of the octreotide, three new lesions were detected in the liver on a CT scan. His general condition was judged to be tolerable to undergo liver resection, and the radiological examinations showed that there was no recurrence except the liver. Complete surgical resection of liver metastases was therefore achieved by an extended right posterior segmentectomy with partial hepatectomy of S2, S3, and S8. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that liver metastases were derived from a glucagon-positive tumor of the pancreatic NET. The Ki67 labeling index of these lesions ranged from 1.5 to 5.4 %.
Nineteen months after the hepatectomy, a CT scan revealed a small nodule in the S4 of the liver. Twenty-three months after the hepatectomy, gadoxetic acid- or gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced MRI demonstrated multiple liver tumors. We started everolimus therapy following a diagnosis of unresectable pancreatic NET recurrence. He is still alive after 4 years and 4 months after the initial surgery, although he is suffering from worsened diabetes mellitus, a pituitary prolactinoma that led to a hemorrhage into the pituitary tumor, and an increasing size of the left nonfunctional adrenal tumor.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 52-year-old woman presented with a nine month history of generalized lymphadenopathy, skin lesions (multiple crusts all over her body), low fever, weight loss of more than 30 kg, vomiting, abdominal distension, mild dyspnea and a left breast mass (measuring 50 x 10 mm). She denied having any allergies or previous relevant diseases.
She was hospitalized for further investigation. Laboratory testing findings showed negative serology for HIV and viral hepatitis, anemia (hemoglobin 11.0 g/dL), and low serum albumin (2.3 g/dL), mild (prerenal) acute kidney injury, and elevated C-reactive protein (over 8 times the maximum reference value).
Chest radiography was performed and showed mild/moderate bilateral pleural effusions. In addition, the patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) of the neck, chest and abdomen. CT revealed the presence of a breast mass, generalized necrotic lymph node enlargement (cervical, axillary, mediastinal, abdominal and inguinal), mild splenomegaly, pleural effusion and ascites ().
She underwent a thoracocentesis that disclosed the presence of a milky fluid whose analysis showed a triglyceride concentration > 600 mg/dL, with no neoplastic cells. Additionally, paracentesis was performed, and the finding was consistent with chylous ascites, and neoplastic cells were not found.
Biopsies of the breast mass (core biopsy), skin lesions and enlarged inguinal lymph nodes were performed and stained using the Grocott-Gomori methenamine-silver (GGMS) technique, the gold standard to diagnose paracoccidioidomycosis according to guidelines. All of the biopsies revealed the presence of large round yeast cells with multiple narrow-based budding daughter cells, characteristic of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis.
Thereafter, liposomal amphotericin B was prescribed, as well as a high protein and low fat diet (supplemented with medium chain triglycerides). Despite the treatment, her clinical status worsened, with development of severe acute kidney injury that required renal replacement therapy, pneumonia, septic shock, and she subsequently died.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"This is a 12-year-old boy with a homozygous LDLR c.682G>T mutation. Both parents have HeFH. The patient has left ventricle dilatation, mild aortic regurgitation and atherosclerotic plaques (1.5–2.1 mm thick) in both carotid bulbs, and in the common and internal carotid arteries. Imaging revealed diffuse atherosclerotic involvement of all coronary arteries, but this was not clinically significant.
The patient was treated with rosuvastatin 20 mg/day, ezetimibe 10 mg/day, LA Q2W, but mean interval LDL-C levels remained increased at approximately 300 mg/dL. The patient was commenced on lomitapide 5 mg/day following a normal FibroScan test. Rosuvastatin 20 mg/day, ezetimibe 10 mg/day and LA Q2W were maintained.
Mean interval LDL-C levels decreased modestly over 2 months (Fig. ). The patient then took a vacation with no LA, and experienced an increase in LDL-C levels that was gradually brought under control with escalating doses of lomitapide. Overall, LDL-C levels decreased by 50–70%. There has been no evidence of adverse events to lomitapide, and liver function tests (LFTs) remain normal (Fig. ). Gastrointestinal (GI) complaints were only present when dietary advice was not followed. The patient achieved an LDL-C nadir of 98 mg/dL (70% reduction). LA intervals have been gradually extended to Q4W with a modest increase in LDL-C levels to 184 mg/dL (44% reduction from baseline).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 54-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to chronic, long-standing type II diabetes mellitus presented in January 2011 with decreased urine output and swelling over the whole body for 3 months. He was trained for CAPD in a stable state of health. The patient was compliant with medical care and had been free from peritonitis to date. However, he presented to the nephrology outpatient department in January 2013 with complaints of fever, abdominal pain and cloudy PD effluent. As the abdominal pain worsened, the patient was admitted to the hospital. The patient denied any contact with soil or plant material. His past medical history was uneventful except for diabetes mellitus for the past 11 years. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 140/80 mm Hg−1, temperature 100.8 ° F, pulse 72 min−1 and respiration rate 18 min−1. His head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination was unremarkable. There was no clubbing, cyanosis, lymphadenopathy or icterus. His lungs were clear and no cardiac murmur was heard. His abdomen was tender in all quadrants with rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were present and active. Pertinent laboratory values were Hgm (Hemoglobin) 7.2 gm dl−1, white blood cells (WBCs) 24000 mm−3, platelets 2.28×105 µl−1, serum creatinine 9.3 mg dl−1, serum blood urea nitrogen 45 mg dl−1, serum uric acid 4.9 mg dl−1, serum sodium 131 mmol l−1, serum potassium 3.5 mmol l−1, serum albumin 3.3 g dl−1, serum bilirubin (total) 0.45 mg dl−1, serum aspartate transaminase 19 U l−1, serum alanine aminotransferase 13 U L−1, serum alkaline phosphatase 105 U l−1, serum amylase 29 U L−1, serum calcium 8.9 mg dl−1, serum phosphorus 5 mg dl−1 and serum lactate dehydrogenase 514 U l−1. PD fluid was sent for cell count, Gram stain and culture. The WBC count in PD fluid was 6400 mm−3 with 82% neutrophils. Gram staining of the fluid showed plenty of Gram-negative bacilli. A presumptive diagnosis of CAPD peritonitis was made and empiric intraperitoneal cefazolin and tobramycin were started. PD fluid culture yielded catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, non-spore-forming and non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli. The isolate was positive for urea hydrolysis and nitrate reduction. Negative reactions were found for the production of H2S, indole, lysine decarboxylase and ornithine decarboxylase for the hydrolysis of gelatin. The identity of the isolate was confirmed as R. radiobacter sensitive to trimethoprim/sulfametoxazole, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoperazone-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, imipinem and meropenem. It was resistant only to aztreonam. Empiric antibiotic therapy was continued and the patient’s abdominal pain subsided and the peritoneal fluid counts decreased to 50 WBCs mm−3 on day 4. However, on the eighth hospital day, the patient again complained of abdominal pain and the PD fluid count increased to 300 WBCs mm−3. The catheter was therefore surgically removed and the tip sent for culture. The tip yielded growth of R. radiobacter.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 53-year-old woman presented to the Cardiology clinic with a 1-month history of retrosternal chest tightness since the bereavement of a friend. Examination was unremarkable. The past medical history included hypertension and there was a family history of premature coronary artery disease. The pain radiated to shoulders, arms, jawline and was present at rest. The patient was, therefore, admitted to hospital for urgent cardiac investigations and inpatient coronary angiography. Post-admission, despite medical therapy, she continued to experience ongoing chest pain in the days preceding and during angiography.
Blood tests: Full blood count, renal function tests, and high-sensitivity troponin I levels were normal.
Echocardiogram: Biventricular size and systolic function normal with no regional wall abnormalities and no significant valvular disease.
Twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECG): Sinus rhythm with T-wave inversion in the inferolateral leads.
The patient underwent coronary angiography via the right radial artery using a 6-Fr sheath. The left coronary artery was engaged using a Voda left 3.5 guide catheter and initial injections in the posteroanterior caudal view revealed TIMI 0 flow in the first obtuse marginal (OM1) branch (Figure ). The left anterior descending artery was free of disease and by the second contrast injection, OM1 flow had normalized (Figure ). Assessment of this vessel using optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed no abnormalities (Figure ), suggesting that the temporary occlusion was due to vasospasm.
The right coronary artery (RCA) was engaged using a Judkins Right 4 catheter and selective angiography revealed a critical lesion in the mid-vessel (Figure ). In view of the history of stress-induced chest pain, the lesion was interrogated with OCT. This revealed a significant intramural haematoma within the mid-vessel causing a critical stenosis with a minimal luminal area of just 1 mm2 (Figure ).
These findings were consistent with Type 3 SCAD. In view of the patient’s ongoing ischaemia and ECG changes, the decision was made to treat this lesion. A 2.5-mm semi-compliant balloon was inflated to six atmospheres to gently pre-dilate the vessel. Repeat angiography and OCT imaging revealed improved appearances of the lesion (Figure ).
A 4 × 10 mm Flextome cutting balloon (Boston Scientific, MA, USA) was then gently inflated for 8 s to nominal pressure on three occasions (Figure ). This led to complete resolution of the intramural haematoma with only very minimal residual intimal dissection on OCT (Figure ). The maximal luminal area of the vessel by the end of the procedure increased to over 10 mm2.
Final angiographic appearances showed excellent resolution of the lesion and TIMI III flow (Figure ). The patient’s symptoms resolved and she was subsequently discharged 2 days later on a regimen of aspirin and clopidogrel for 3 months and aspirin alone thereafter. This dual antiplatelet regimen was prescribed due to disruption of the intimal layer by balloon angioplasty. The patient was followed-up in clinic and found to be asymptomatic with no further recurrences of angina. She will be investigated for associated conditions such as fibromuscular dysplasia.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 69-year-old man visited our hospital for palpitation and dyspnea on exertion. The symptoms began four months prior to his visit to the hospital. On physical examination, a rapid heartbeat and friction rub were audible, and a 6-cm linear scar was observed on the right upper chest. Edema of both lower extremities was observed. At the age of 6 in 1950, he was wounded in the chest during a shooting spree by North Korean soldiers during the Korean War. However, at that time he could not visit a hospital and was treated with folk remedies. On the chest X-ray, a bullet adjacent to the right cardiac border and bilateral pleural effusion was noted (). On electrocardiography, he had typical atrial flutter with 2-to-1 atrioventricular conduction, and his heart rate was 150 bpm (). An axial computed tomographic image () showed that the bullet was likely located in the right atrium. Thickening of the pericardium was also observed. A long axis reformatted image () and a three-dimensional volume-rendered image () confirmed that the bullet was located in the epicardial fat and abutted the right atrium at an acute angle. Transthoracic echocardiography during the atrial flutter and sinus rhythm revealed bi-atrial enlargement, thickened pericardium, septal bouncing motion, and significant respiratory variations of the mitral inflow velocity, which were compatible with constrictive pericarditis (). The E/A and E/e' ratios were 4.4 and 8, respectively. The septal e' was higher than the lateral e' (12 cm/sec and 10 cm/sec, respectively). To rule out lead poisoning from the bullet, the patient's blood lead level was checked and lead was undetectable. Atrial flutter and constrictive pericarditis were the suspected causes of the palpitation and dyspnea on exertion. An electrophysiological study confirmed that the atrial flutter was cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent: during the electrophysiological study, fluoroscopy showed that the bullet moved primarily with respiratory movements and partially with heart-beating movements. Moreover, pericardial calcification was also observed adjacent to the coronary sinus. Radiofrequency catheter ablation for ty-pical atrial flutters was performed by a bidirectional conduction block of the cavotricuspid isthmus. One week after radiofrequency catheter ablation, surgical extraction of the bullet and pericardiectomy were performed. In the surgical field, the pericardium was th-ickened and the bullet was severely adhered to the adjacent epicardial tissue (). There were scattered substances around the bullet, which were presumed to be gunpowder. Due to the gunpowder, the pericardium was thickened and stiffened. The rusted bullet was extracted 63 years after the initial gunshot wound. The pathology of the adjacent epicardial tissue showed dystrophic calcification (). After surgery, the patient recovered without complications and there was no echocardiographic evidence of constrictive physiology.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"An 84-year-old male patient with past medical history consisting of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and open angle glaucoma was admitted to ICU via A & E with an unwitnessed collapse and decreased level of consciousness. In emergency department (ED) his GCS was recorded as 5/15, blood sugar was found to be only 34 mg/dL, his heart rate was 34 beats per minutes (bpm), and BP was 58/43 mm Hg. His ECG showed sinus bradycardia with variable blocks including sinus node dysfunction and type 1 Mobitz heart block pattern (Figures and ). He was intubated and ventilated in ED and given dextrose 50% 100 mL and 0.5 mg Atropine. His heart rate rose to 88 bpm and with improvement of heart rate and correction of blood sugar his BP became 135/88 and his GCS improved to 13/15. Unfortunately, heart rate started to drop again to 40 s and blood sugar showed a downward trend for which he was given 1 mg glucagon and was transferred to ICU. By the time he reached ICU his heart rate had improved to 90 bpm. In ICU after 30 minutes his heart rate dropped again so he was given another dose of Atropine and a temporary transvenous pace maker (TPM) was inserted. The patient's blood sugar also improved temporarily but eventually required intravenous infusion of 10% dextrose for the next 12 hours before it was stabilized. His GCS improved to 14/15 and he was extubated the next day 16 hours after admission but repeated attempts to switch off his pace maker revealed underlying brady-arrythmias with heart rate dropping to 34–40 bpm associated with presyncopal symptoms comprising of deterioration in attention and episodes of drowsiness. The pace maker was eventually switched off after 26 hours of observation when no more episodes of bradycardia were observed.
A detailed neurological assessment was carried out after extubation which showed the patient to be confused with no motor deficit. His CT brain was done which showed no abnormality and a detailed history was sought from the patient's wife who pointed out that the patient has been behaving in a weird and confused way for the last 5 days but his wife attributed that to demise of one of his close relative who died a week ago. She further added that he stopped taking his oral medications 2 days before he was admitted but he was given his eye drops regularly by his daughter who feared blindness in case the medication was not given. His drug history consisted of Enalapril 10 mg OD, Atorvastatin 10 mg OD, Metformin 500 mg BID, and Timolol Maleate 0.5% one drop each eye twice a day which was started 35 days before admission to ICU when he was diagnosed as a case of glaucoma.
Tilt table test was not carried out and keeping in view his improvement in blood sugar and heart rate after administration of glucagon his clinical picture of hypoglycemia, confusion, and bradyarrhythmia was recognized to be because of ophthalmic Timolol Maleate which was changed to Travoprost (a prostaglandin F2 analogue) after consulting the ophthalmologist.
The patient was kept under observation in ICU for another 24 hours. His intrinsic heart rate improved to 82 bpm and his TPM wire was removed before transferring to ward. Patient's confusion also improved gradually over the next 3 days and he was discharged on Enalapril, Travoprost, and Metformin. His followup for the next two months was unremarkable.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 23-year-old man, without any past medical history, underwent open reduction, and internal fixation for a radial neck fracture and left olecranon fracture (Fig. ) sustained during a fall. He was referred to the rehabilitation department due to pain and a limited range of motion (ROM) of his left elbow 2 months following the injury. Physical examination of the left elbow in the clinic of the rehabilitation department revealed an active ROM of 40° to 60°, passive ROM of 40° to 60°, supination of 0° to 20°, and pronation of 0° to 30°. Physical therapy was arranged with therapeutic exercises including joint mobilization, stretch exercises to help increase elbow extension, as well as elbow flexion and extension with a sand bag and wrist supination and pronation with a stick following 15 minutes of infrared therapy.
After approximately 6 months of physical therapy, the pain and ROM in the elbow improved, with an active ROM of 40° to 100°, passive ROM of 5° to 110°, supination of 0° to 30°, and pronation of 0° to 35°. He was admitted again 9 months after surgery to undergo removal of the internal fixation, and was discharged home after 2 days. During admission for removal, an X-ray taken showed bony union of the fracture site and smooth cortical bone without obvious fractures around the previous injury site or the drill holes (Fig. ). After discharge, the patient remained under the rehabilitation program at our department and the symptoms gradually improved.
However, on 1 day, 5 months after removal of the internal fixation, the patient complained of left elbow tenderness with a “breaking” sound occurring during physical therapy. He was promptly sent to emergency room in our hospital and the results of a subsequent X-ray revealed a greenstick fracture of the left ulnar shaft (Fig. ). After discussion with our orthopedic department, a cross-elbow splint was applied. Two months after splinting, the tenderness and numbness of the elbow was alleviated, and callus and increased density of the ulnar shaft was identified on subsequent X-rays (Fig. ).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 25-year-old lady presented to dental out-patient services with swelling and pain in the right side of the face. Local examination showed a fluctuant swelling measuring 5 mm × 3 cm over the right side of the angle of mandible []. The swelling was warm and tender on palpation with signs of impending rupture. Clinical examination of the orofacial region did not reveal any odontogenic or non-odontogenic foci of infection. Patient's vitals were in the normal limits. All the hematological parameters were normal except for borderline leukocytosis and a low hemoglobin level. Incision and drainage (I and D) of the abscess was carried out under local anesthesia. As the patient was in her 12th week of gestation, antibiotics were prescribed in consultation with the gynecologist.
On a follow-up visit after 2 weeks, a painless indurated swelling at the same site was noted [, inset]. Pus culture carried out during the incision and drainage had not revealed any bacterial growth. As the condition was not resolving, a fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was advised in consultation with the pathologist, to rule out tubercular infection.
Aspirate from the swelling yielded purulent material. The smears were moderately cellular and showed abundant necrotic debris within which were seen polymorphs and histiocytes. One of the smears revealed the presence of a single microfilaria of W. bancrofti, which was rounded anteriorly and tapered posteriorly []. The caudal end of the microfilariae had a clear space free of nuclei. After the aspiration, the patient was admitted and a midnight blood sample was taken. The wet mount preparation showed motile microfilariae, which confirmed the diagnosis of filariasis.
Since, the patient was in the first trimester of pregnancy, decision was taken to start the anti-filarial drugs after delivery.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 71-year-old male patient, former smoker, had a diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis treated since few years with talidomide, melphalan, and disodic pamidronate. He presented at our ambulatory with worsening dyspnea. The chest X-ray showed bilateral pleural effusion despite of optimized diuretics therapy. Serum pro-BNP was within normal values. Chest and abdomen CT-scan was performed showing moderate bilateral pleural effusion, pleural thickening with enhancement after contrast mean injection, and multiple micro-calcifications in the distal lung regions and in the spleen. Lung function tests resulted in severe restrictive impairment (vital capacity (VC), total lung capacity (TLC), residual volume (RV), and forced vital capacity (FVC): 40%, 43%, 42%, and 45% of the predicted values) and severe diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (CO)(DLCO) reduction (38% of the predicted value). The chemical-physical analysis demonstrated the trasudative nature of the drained pleural fluid. The diagnosis of primary systemic AL amyloidosis with pleural involvement was then performed by means of tissue specimen examination obtained with the Cope needle pleural biopsy.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 50-year-old Korean woman who had never smoked visited our lung cancer clinic in February 2015. She complained of upper airway infection symptoms of mild back pain followed by cough with sputum and rhinorrhea. Computed tomography (CT) from an outside hospital showed a right upper lobar mass with enlargement of adjacent interlobar lymph node, and miliary distribution of multiple tiny nodules in both lungs (). She was diagnosed with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with metastases to both lungs, T12 spine, left femur and brain that was proven by endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA), positron emission tomography and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Her initial tumor biopsy from primary mass and lymph nodes was negative for EGFR mutation and ALK translocation.
She received four cycles of pemetrexed and cisplatin, and her tumor burden was retained as stable disease (). She stopped the chemotherapy due to poor performance status without maintenance therapy. Upon progression of right upper lobar mass, multiple lung nodules and metastatic lymphadenopathies after 2 months without subsequent treatment (), she received gefitinib for the next 2 months. Subjectively-rated symptoms of nausea and myalgia seemed to ease, but gefitinib was finally stopped due to aggravation of gastrointestinal toxicity and lung-to-lung metastases (). Thereafter, progression in brain metastasis was also demonstrated in follow-up MRI. She suffered from general weakness, nausea and back pain, and so was reluctant to receive further cytotoxic chemotherapy.
In September 2015, she agreed to be tested for another activating mutation using previously achieved specimen by EBUS-TBNA. Pathologic examination revealed a poorly differentiated atypical cell nest with focal glandular differentiation (). Immunohistochemical stain for c-erbB2 showed weak membranous staining (). After direct sequencing as screening test, the following next generation sequencing (NGS) of the tissue revealed a HER2 exon 20 mutation with A-to-G base change at nucleotide 2437 (c.2437A>G), which led to substitution of aspartate for asparagine at position 813 (p.N813D) (). This mutation has never been reported. In October 2015, she started afatinib 40 mg daily. An initial clinical and radiologic response was achieved within a month. She professed a sense of well-being and relief of back pain, and simple chest X-ray showed more decreased lung nodules grossly. During week 6 of treatment, a CT assessment revealed a partial response in extracranial lesions with prominent regression of primary lung tumors in the right upper lobe and lung-to-lung metastases (). Brain metastases had maintained the stable state, and she did not complain of any neurologic symptom or sign. After stepwise dose reduction to 20 mg due to stomatitis and nausea, she has continued the medication until February 2016 without deterioration of subjective symptom and tumor burden. Last CT scan on January 2016 still showed a partial response in extracranial lesion, but brain MRI revealed mild increase of metastases. At last visit on February 2016, the patient complained of general weakness and anorexia with stomatitis, and thereafter she was lost to follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A previously healthy 8-month-old boy presented with a 3×3 cm mass in the right lower leg, which was surgically excised. Pathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of infantile fibrosarcoma and the surgical margin was not clear. His parents refused reexcision but accepted monitoring by regular imaging. However, a mass was detected again in the same area two years after surgery. Therefore, the patient then underwent complete excision, and recurrent sarcoma was confirmed histologically. After the second resection, the patient had monthly follow-up and no evidence of disease was observed on an ongoing one year.
A surveillance whole-body fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan conducted 3 years after the initial presentation demonstrated a recurrent mass in the right lower leg, one micrometastatic lesions at the left proximal fibula and another macrometastasis in the 4th lumbar vertebral column, respectively. Lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a contrast-enhancing lesion of 1.6 cm in the posterior aspect of the 4th lumbar vertebral column without spinal canal compression (). To preserve right lower leg, debulking surgery of the recurrent lesion was performed, and the histological features were found to be consistent with recurrent sarcoma with rhabomyosarcomatous differentiation. Two weeks after the surgery, the patient started to receive chemotherapy with a VAC regimen composed of vincristine (1.5 mg/m2), dactinomycin (0.045 mg/kg), and cyclophosphamide (2.2 g/m2) for a total of 44 weeks treatment course.
Given the potential risk of spinal pathologic fracture and myelopathy, radiotherapy was chosen to treat the 4th lumbar vertebral metastatic lesion. Cyberknife® hypofractionated radiotherapy was decided due to the solitary nature of the metastasis and fewer sessions are needed, which would decrease the frequency of general anesthesia for radiotherapy. The patient was immobilized in a vacuum mattress. Fused enhanced computed tomography (CT) (Accuray) and MRI scans were used in the treatment planning. The delineation of the gross tumor volume (GTV) and the organs at risk was carried out on the planning CT. Given the potential risk of kyphosis and scoliosis by asymmetric irradiation of the spine, the whole involved vertebra was contoured as the GTV. Clinical target volume was equal to the GTV and no margin was added to obtain the planning target volume (PTV), which was 8.84 mL. No fiducial or other markers were implanted to localize the irradiated area. A total of 26 Gy was prescribed to the 75% isodose line, covering 92.64% of the PTV with a maximal spinal cord dose of 744.26 cGy (). Cyberknife® stereotactic body radiotherapy was performed on the 15th, 16th, 19th, and 20th of October 2009 with a mean procedure time of 83 min (range 56 min to 128 min). The radiotherapy course was conducted in a manner concomitant with the first cycle of chemotherapy. During the radiotherapy, immobilization was aided by general anesthesia, and X-sight spine tracking (Accuray Inc.) was used to minimize setup error.
The patient tolerated the anesthesia and immobilization well and remained still during the radiotherapy. Up to the date of this report, i.e., 33 months after radiotherapy, the patient remains neurologically stable and 23% reduction in tumor volume was achieved on the surveillance MRI scans (). No acute radiation toxicity was found.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 60-year-old black man – born in the Rio de Janeiro city and living in Teresópolis, RJ, Brazil – reported that when he was taking the mail from his mailbox, he accidentally put his left arm on six specimens of light green and brown caterpillars, which had about 5 cm length. The animals were crushed by the arm of the man, who, immediately, withdrawn it. He washed the arm using soap and water, applied alcohol to the affected area and also took an anti-allergy drug (could not say which).
The site affected by the caterpillars became swollen and after 20 minutes a burning sensation started. The victim also noticed a painful lymph node in the ipsilateral axilla, which disappeared spontaneously shortly after. In the same night, after dinner, he had abdominal distension associated with discomfort and vomiting. He did not take medicines to relieve the symptoms. As there was improvement, he laid down to sleep. After that, the man woke up at dawn feeling an intense abdominal pain (flank region) and arthralgia (upper and lower limbs), which became worse when he attempted to move.
Subsequently, the patient looked for medical assistance and went to a local hospital. His clinical picture was described as pain associated with sudden anuria. He was admitted to the hospital to treatment. The man reported a previous history of nephrolithiasis and received treatment with saline solution, analgesics and urinary catheter to provide relief. He also received treatment for arterial hypertension with atenolol, 50 mg/day; until this time there was no evidence of kidney injury.
During the hospitalization, the patient had developed diffuse edema, flank pain and the anuria remained, despite of use of intravenous hydration and furosemide infusion. Laboratory and imaging tests were performed (Tables and ).
After two more days, the patient was transferred to the Hospital das Clínicas de Teresópolis Costantino Ottaviano (HCTCO), where he remained for forty-five days due to hemodialysis treatment. Four days after the admission to HCTCO, he remembered the episode with the caterpillars in the morning before the painful crisis and anuria. That was the moment when the suspicion of erucism by Lonomia aroused (seven days after the accident).
The use of SALon was not indicated because the patient did not meet the criteria for it, particularly due to the time elapsed since the accident, hospital care for more than 10 hours and less than or equal to 36 hours []. During the admission the patient showed bruises scattered on upper and lower limbs and two voluminous cases of melena. After those events, there was no spontaneous recovery of renal function, which progressed to chronic renal disease (CRD), stage V – end-stage renal disease, when the glomerular filtration rate is below 15% of normal and the patient needs, invariably, renal replacement therapy.
Lonomia caterpillar has about six to seven centimeters long, and its color ranges from light brownish-green to yellowish-brown with three longitudinal stripes of dark-brown []. Its body is covered with bristles that contain toxins. The transformation to an adult moth occurs after a in ten weeks after three to six months of larval life [,].
Lonomia is found throughout Brazil, however, numerous registered cases of erucism occurred in the southern region, mainly in Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina states, and were attributed to L. obliqua[,]. In recent years, there have been accidents in Minas Gerais, Goiás, Maranhão and Rio de Janeiro states [,,].
Erucism caused by Lonomia is uncommon in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Therefore, the present study is one of the first cases reported in the state. The increased rate of envenomations – especially in areas where they were not previously described – has been attributed to deforestation of indigenous trees, natural habitat of caterpillars, which are forced migrating to fruit trees in urban areas [,].
The symptoms of Lonomia envenomation range from local cutaneous manifestations to serious and potentially fatal systemic reactions []. General symptoms such as headache, unspecific indisposition, fever, nausea, vomit, arthralgia, myalgia, conjunctivitis and abdominal pain vary depending on the species involved, the intensity of the contact and the victim’s response [,,,]. Hemorrhagic syndrome and acute renal failure (ARF) are unusual outcomes, but potentially fatal [,-].
The pathophysiological mechanisms of ARF in Lonomia envenomig are not clear yet. Probably, there is a relation between renal ischemia and systemic hypotension and/or fibrin deposition in glomerular capillaries [-]. Another hypothesis is that venom components may act directly on the kidneys [,].
Lonomia spp. venom is rich in several toxins that have procoagulant and fibrinolytic activities, which can significantly affect the blood coagulation process. For example, the enzyme lonofibrase is able to trigger a hemorrhagic syndrome similar to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) by increasing fibrinogen degradation products and decreasing plasminogen, fibrinogen and factor XIII [,,,-]. Lonomia obliqua venom contains several lipocalins (protein group that transports hydrophobic molecules), among which is the Lonomia obliqua prothrombin activator protein (Lopap), involved in the increase of expression of adhesion molecules on cellular surface [-].
Erucism is diagnosed based on history of contact with the caterpillar and corroborated by data from laboratory tests. Laboratory abnormalities include slightly low platelet count, high urea and creatinine levels, slight increase of total bilirubin, and augmentation of indirect bilirubin, free hemoglobin and haptoglobin decrease in cases of hemolysis [].
Treatment consists of washing the affected area with cold water, cold compresses, local anesthetic infiltration using lidocaine 2% and topical corticosteroids. In case of bleeding, the patient should be kept resting in order to avoid traumatic intervention [,]. The antilonomic serum (SALon) is indicated according to the severity of the accident, and its early administration prevents bleeding manifestations that start from one to ten days after the contact depending on its intensity and location [,,-].","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 37-year-old African American female with a history of two unprovoked deep venous thromboses (DVT) treated with apixaban was evaluated for a pruritic rash of two weeks' duration. She had started apixaban two months prior to the rash onset; there were otherwise no changes in her medication regimen. The exam showed hyperpigmented brown scaly plaques with central atrophic patches on the conchal bowl of the ears (Figure ), violaceous nodules, and indurated plaques with scattered flaccid vesicles on the medial thighs, knees, and antecubital fossae (Figures , ), and eroded plaques with dry, serosanguinous crust on the elbows. Vesicles were not appreciated on non-lesional skin and there was no mucosal involvement. She endorsed hematuria and weight loss but denied lesion photosensitivity. Laboratory analysis was significant for leukopenia (WBC of 3.4 thousands/μL), anemia (hemoglobin of 5.6 g/dL), and proteinuria. Serology was positive for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (>1:160), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), anti-Smith, anti-Ro/SSA, cardiolipin antibody, beta2 glycoprotein antibody, and low C3 and C4 complement.
A 4-mm punch biopsy of a representative lesion from the medial knee was performed. Histopathologic findings suggested early SCLE and consisted of basilar vacuolar degeneration with scant dermal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate (Figure ). Colloidal iron staining highlighted mucin deposition throughout the superficial and deep dermis (Figure ). Apixaban was discontinued and warfarin initiated. Triamcinolone 0.01% was used as needed for her skin.

"This patient is an 11-year-old girl with a homozygous duplication spanning the promoter region to exon 6 of LDLR (c.-187-? 940+? Dup) []. Family history includes sudden death in an older brother aged 17. Another brother has HoFH with aortic stenosis and a non-critical obstruction of the right coronary artery. The patient presented with non-critical aortic stenosis/supra aortic stenosis, and non-obstructive plaques in the carotid arteries. Her computed tomography angiography showed no signs of coronary artery disease.
The patient commenced LLT at the age of 2 years when LDL-C levels were 1009 mg/dL. Up until the age of 7, she was treated with atorvastatin 40 mg/day and ezetimibe 10 mg/day and her LDL-C level was 453 mg/dL. LA is not available in the patient’s home country.
At age 7, atorvastatin dose was decreased to 10 mg/day, and lomitapide was commenced at a dose of 5 mg/day. Over the next year, lomitapide was escalated to 30 mg/dL but this dose was reduced back to 20 mg/day as a result of diarrhoea. LDL-C levels were effectively reduced with treatment (nadir 231 mg/dL; 40.7% reduction) with no elevations in LFTs (Fig. ). A trip to a remote region of Brazil led to brief discontinuation of lomitapide with a consequent increase in LDL-C levels. Following resolution of the issues, reintroduction of lomitapide resulted in the expected decrease in LDL-C levels.
The patient is now maintained on atorvastatin 60 mg/day, ezetimibe 10 mg/day and lomitapide 20 mg/day and has been treated with lomitapide for 4.5 years. She continues to develop normally and had her menarche at the age of 11 years. LDL-C levels are 266 mg/dL (38% reduction from pre-lomitapide values). A routine check-up revealed no calcification in the coronary arteries; however, there were signs of aortic stenosis and supra aortic stenosis, and some non-obstructive plaques in the carotid arteries, but these are not considered to be life-threatening. There were no elevations of liver enzymes during treatment. A detailed history of this patient has been published by Chacra et al. [].","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 32 year old man was referred because of left knee pain. Six months before he had a subtotal meniscectomy of the medial meniscus for a bucket handle tear. He was a local policeman that could not develop his work because of non-responsive pain in prolonged stand up position and severe limitation for running and other sports activities.
Physical examination revealed a varus morphotype with positive meniscal maneuvers and medial joint pain. Radiographic imaging showed impingement of the medial compartment corresponding to a Fairbank grade II. The report of magnetic resonance imaging indicated a small medial meniscus remnant, almost absent in body and no posterior horn attachment with a focal osteochondritis of the medial femoral condyle. An arthroscopic evaluation was recommended and different therapeutic options were explained.
After informed consent and pre-surgical study, knee arthroscopy was performed under epidural anesthesia and preventive ischemia of the left lower extremity. Arthroscopy showed absence of part of the body and posterior horn of medial meniscus (Figure A and B). The anterior part of the meniscal tissue showed degenerative signs. In the lateral area of the medial femoral condyle near the notch, a focal Outerbridge chondral injury grade III was observed. The remaining meniscal tissue was regularized until reaching a healthy-look tissue and the meniscal wall was reconstructed with autologous graft with a double semitendinosus tendon. The tendon was identified through an oblique incision over the tibial insertion of the hamstrings. The graft was introduced through the antero-medial portal across the anterior capsule, pulling on the sutures through a tibial tunnel that was previously drilled in antero-posterior and medio-lateral direction pointing to the insertion of the posterior horn (Figures B and A). The graft was fixed with sutures “outside-in” to the menisco-tibial ligaments and then sutured to the anterior horn remainder, “inside-out” in the body, “all inside” in the posterior horn and a tibial staple distally to the tibial tunnel (Figure A and B).
The knee was immobilized at 20 degrees of flexion for 3 weeks. Partial weight bearing was authorized at the third post-operative week. Then, range of motion was allowed from 0 to 90 degrees until the sixth week. Postoperative physical examination was made, showing only mild effusion of the knee. After six weeks, progressive flexion was permitted. A 1.5 Tesla MRI in coronal plane (FigureA) showed that the double semitendinosus tendon reached the lateral margin of the lateral tibial plateau. In sagittal plane (FigureB) a bulky posterior graft was adapted to the posterior tibial plateau.
Five months later he underwent a new arthroscopy. The new reconstructed “meniscal wall” with semitendinosus tendon was stable and invaded by a synovial tissue similar to the native tissue (Figure A and B). The anterior horn showed an oblique tear with degenerative appearance in the graft union and the osteochondral lesion reduced its size with some fibrocartilage areas. The anterior horn of medial meniscus was regularized and a collagen meniscal implant of 40 mm was inserted. The CMI was attached to the new meniscal rim with sutures “all-inside” in the posterior horn (Figure A) and sutures “outside-in” for the body and anterior horn (Figure B). In addition, microfractures were performed in the area of osteochondritis with stabilization of the edges of the cartilage defect with a radiofrequency terminal.
In the postoperative period, the knee movement was limited from 0° and 30° during the first week, until 60° between first and third week and up to 90° between third and sixth week. Then, free range of motion was allowed and a progressive partial weight bearing was authorized in the third post-operative week.
Two months after the last surgery, the patient’s physical examination revealed a joint range of motion of 0º to 120°, without effusion, moderate quadriceps atrophy and some occasional discomfort related with sustained load bearing.
After 3 months, the patient was admitted in other Hospital because of an acute truncal viral encephalitis of unknown etiology. However, after a complete neurological examination any correlation with the knee surgery was discarded.
At 5 months, the patient only presented occasional discomfort in the popliteal region, mild atrophy of the quadriceps and minimum non inflammatory effusion that was drained and sent to microbiological study. The magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that both grafts were correctly placed in middle and posterior zones with moderate anterior extrusion and marked synovitis. In the sample cultures, there was growth of colonies of Staphylococcus simulans. Despite that the culture results were considered to be a contaminating agent rather than a pathogen, antibiotic therapy was prescribed according to the antibiogram.
At 7 months, a diagnostic arthroscopy was performed because of persistent knee effusion with no local or systemic signs of infection. A marked generalized synovitis was observed, and three samples were taken for pathologic and microbiologic studies. Then, a partial synovectomy and joint toillette was performed. The meniscal implant was stable with complete integrity. The chondral defect of medial femoral condyle was covered with fibrocartilage. The results of the studies reported inflammatory synovitis with no pathogens growth.
Ten months after the placement of the CMI, the patient only complained of occasional discomfort related with periods of increased physical activity. MRI showed reduced synovitis and no osteoarthritis progression neither posterior extrusion of the implant were observed (Figure A and B).
After two years of the CMI surgery, the patient had no medial compartment pain neither activity daily living limitations and only complained of non specific discomfort with intense activities. In the Lysholm-Gillquist score 92 points was obtained. The varus deformity was not increased. The MRI revealed the correct fitting and complete integration of implants except moderate extrusion of the anterior horn. No significant degenerative changes were observed.

"A 75-year-old woman with a medical history of hypertension presented at another institution with fecal occult blood, and a colonoscopy showed a type II tumor in the sigmoid colon. She was referred to our hospital for tumor resection, where colonoscopy determined that the tumor was located 23 cm from the anal verge. Histopathology of a biopsy specimen revealed a moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. Enhanced computed tomography of the thorax and abdomen showed sigmoid colon wall thickening. Regional lymph node metastasis was suspected, but no evidence of distant metastasis was observed. A blood examination revealed an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentration (32.7 ng/ml). Following a diagnosis of cancer of the sigmoid colon, clinical stage IIIb [cT4a, N1b, M0], a laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy was performed without complications. The postoperative histopathological examination revealed a moderately differentiated to mucinous adenocarcinoma. Three of the 16 retrieved lymph nodes contained malignant cells. Finally, the cancer was classified as stage IIIb [pT4a, pN1b, M0]. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged 10 days after the surgery. Following the diagnosis of stage III colorectal cancer, the patient was recommended to receive adjuvant chemotherapy with CAPOX starting 4 weeks after surgery. The selected regimen consisted of capecitabine (1,000 mg/m2 orally twice daily) for 14 days and L-OHP (130 mg/m2 intravenous infusion) on the first day of each cycle, with a periodicity of 3 weeks over 3 months (four cycles). The anticancer drug dosage was reduced to 80% because of the patient's age. The patient had postoperative physical weakness and appetite loss, and also received 7.5 g of NYT daily throughout the course of adjuvant chemotherapy. She did not report any events of peripheral loss of appetite, general fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia, or febrile neutropenia.

His voice was high pitched and growth was stunted as parameters were less than the third percentile. Teeth and genitals were normal and intelligence quotient (IQ) was corresponding to the age. Hands were short and clawed with thickening and hardening of the skin over the knuckles with racquet nails. The ribs were prominent and anterior fontanelle was open. There was mottled pigmentation and sclerodermatous changes over the trunk and lower limbs []. Lower limbs also had prominence of knees and slight valgus deformity [Figures and ].
Routine investigations were within normal limits. The serum lipid profile showed a decrease in high-density lipoproteins (HDL). X-ray of the chest showed a pyriform thorax, overcrowding of proximal ribs, and short clavicle with pointed lateral ends []. X-ray of the skull showed diastasis of the sutures and prognathism [].

"A 73-year-old man had a past operative history of ruptured colonic diverticulitis treated by Hartmann’s procedure in 2007, and perforated peptic ulcer treated by pyloroplasty in 2009. He suffered from abdominal and tarry stool for 5 days in March 2011, so he was admitted to a rural hospital for further survey and medication. An initial upper GI endoscopy showed gastric ulcer only, but hypotension with tachycardia and a drop in hemoglobin of 9 g/dl from 12 g/dl occurred the next day. Intravenous fluid and blood transfusion with packed red blood cell were prescribed. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with rupture was highly suspected, so CTA of aorta (Fig. ) was carried out which disclosed an AAA with swollen bowel loop. He was transferred to our emergency department (ED) for consideration of vascular surgical intervention.
On arrival in our ED, vital signs were a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per min, a heart rate of 130 beats per min, a blood pressure of 98/73 mmHg, and a body temperature of 35.6 °C. Physical examination revealed a pale conjunctiva, no heart murmur, clear breathing sound, old operative scar over middle abdomen, and hypoactive bowel sound with tenderness over the periumbilical region. Leukocytosis, anemia, abnormal liver profiles, and metabolic acidosis were found. Laboratory investigations were summarized in Table .
A cardiovascular surgeon carried out emergent angiography of aorta, which depicted bleeding from the wall of the AAA and chronic total occlusion of the left external iliac artery, so a modified aorto-uni-iliac stent graft (Fig. ) was implanted with femoral-to-femoral bypass, which underwent smoothly.

A donor corneoscleral button was mounted on an artificial anterior chamber and dissected with automated microkeratome (Moria, Inc, France). After 8-mm trephination, a thin lenticule was placed on Busin glide and pulled into anterior chamber by forceps, where it was unfolded and attached to the recipient cornea by air bubble for 10 min. The final air was left as the graft size at the end of surgery. Postoperatively, the lenticule was well attached to the cornea. Topical 0.1% betamethasone was prescribed four times daily and was tapered to twice daily 2 months later. Postoperative vision improved to 20/40. Nine months after surgery, a 3-mm circumscribed opacification was seen in the anterior surface of the IOL within the pupil region []. The opacification was characterized by fine and white granular deposits. The vision of the right eye slightly decreased to 20/50. However, the opacification did not increase and her vision was 20/50 during the 3-year follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 67-year-old female with NF1 presented with lumbago, cold sweats, and sudden onset weakness, which necessitated an emergency transfer to our institution. She had no significant past medical history, was negative for hypertension, and was on no regular medications. She was hypotensive (systolic blood pressure = 60 mmHg) and tachycardic on arrival. An abdominal contrast computed tomography (CT) scan showed a rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with communication between the aneurysm and the inferior vena cava (IVC) (Fig. a, b). The maximum dimensions of the ruptured AAA and IVC were 34 mm and 37 mm, respectively. The aortic rupture was located 7.5 cm distal to the renal artery and 2.5 cm proximal to the bifurcation of the aorta (Fig. c). Due to the difficulty of primarily closing the ruptured IVC, we planned an endovascular treatment to control the bleeding from the IVC by exclusion of the ruptured AAA. The diameter of normal proximal aorta was 16 mm, which was too narrow to place a normal Y-shaped graft. Moreover, there was insufficient time to prepare another stent in emergency. Therefore, we instead deployed an ENDURANTII (Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, CA, USA) iliac extension proximal to the terminal aorta that was long enough to insert three or more stents (Fig. d). As the bleeding from the AAA and the communication between the aneurysm and the IVC were not well controlled, we placed an EXCLUDER (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) cuff in the ENDURANTII iliac extension. Although a type IV endoleak was detected on angiography, the patient’s hemodynamics stabilized. We therefore decided to conclude the operation at this point and re-assess the endoleak in a few days.
An abdominal contrast CT performed 3 days after the operation showed a type Ib endoleak and injury to the distal abdominal aorta (Fig. a). This led to a redo-EVAR 4 days after operation. This included deploying an AFX (Endologix, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) graft, as well as an infrarenal cuff, as the AFX head did not fit exactly within the stent placed in the primary operation. We also performed coil embolization treatment of the left internal iliac artery aneurysm (Fig. b), which was identified initially (Fig. b). We confirmed no endoleak at the final angiography. An abdominal contrast CT performed 18 days after the primary operation showed two new sequential aneurysms of the LCA, which were not previously detected. Coil embolization was planned to address these new aneurysms.
Twenty-two days after primary operation, however, the patient presented with new onset nausea, left abdominal pain, and hypotension. Her systolic blood pressure was 50 mmHg. She was resuscitated and required vasopressor support. Laboratory tests, including leukocyte count and electrolytes, were normal. The serum C-reactive protein and D-dimer were elevated to 0.37 mg/dl (normal range 0.01–0.30) and 6.8 μg/ml (normal range 0.0–1.0), respectively. We considered potential bleeding from nearby arteries, including the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and lumbar artery [, ]. An abdominal contrast CT showed enlargement of LCA aneurysms and surrounding hematoma (Fig. a–c), establishing the diagnosis of rupture of the LCA aneurysms. Emergency exploratory surgery was performed.
We gained access through a midline abdominal incision. Active bleeding was encountered intraperitoneally and controlled with compression. As a result of the patient’s initial AAA rupture, residual hematoma was present, which extended along the entire left abdomen and retroperitoneum (Fig. a). In addition, the AAA stent endograft had resulted in a left laterally displaced aorta, narrowing our operative field. Due to her distorted anatomy, active bleeding, and clinical condition, we elected to perform a left hemicolectomy. We divided the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) 3 cm distal to the IMA root to not to injure the recently repaired aorta. We divided the colon at the rectosigmoid junction. Proximally, we divided the colon at the middle of the transverse colon (Fig. b). The mesentery was divided to include the LCA aneurysms. Given her clinical condition, we elected to not perform a colorectal anastomosis, but instead performed a Hartmann’s procedure with an end transverse colon colostomy. The surgery took 145 min, and the estimated blood loss was 4.5 L. Packed red blood cell transfusion volume was approximately 1.96 L, and fresh frozen plasma volume was 1.44 L.
In reviewing the specimens, a 2-cm aneurysmal sac and 1-cm aneurysmal sac were identified in the LCA. No thrombus was identified (Fig. a, b). No ischemic changes and no tumor were observed in the excised colon (Fig. c). Interestingly, fibrous tissue around the left colic artery stained positive for S-100 protein, suggesting that neurofibroma from NF1 might have been associated with the rupture of these aneurysms due to weakened integrity of the vascular walls (Fig. a–e). A follow-up abdominal CT showed no recurrence of the endoleak. The patient was discharged 37 days after the last operation without any other post-operative complications.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 65-year-old man with a 60-pack-year smoking history presented with a right middle lobe ground glass opaque (GGO) nodule which measured 1.9 cm. One year later, the nodule progressed in size to 2.8 cm (Figure ). CT scan showed there was no mediastinal adenopathy present in the chest. Transthoracic needle aspiration was performed and demonstrated atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) (Figure ). The patient was recommended to undergo right middle lobectomy, but refused and was referred for a radiation oncology consultation. The case was presented at the multidisciplinary tumor conference where there were multiple differing opinions on the future management considerations for this patient. To date, there is no evidence supporting stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) use for AAH. Observation was recommended with a serial CT scan every three months. At the two-year follow-up visit with repeat chest CT, the GGO is unchanged in appearance or size.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 61-year-old woman was referred by another institution with a diagnosis of distal transverse colon invasive adenocarcinoma and resectable liver metastases. Her past medical history revealed type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. No relevant family history was noted. The case was discussed at the multidisciplinary tumor board meeting, and the decision was taken for the patient to undergo surgery for the primary tumor and subsequently address the treatment of liver metastases. A laparoscopic-assisted transverse colectomy with primary anastomosis was performed with no intraoperative complications. On the fourth postoperative day, she developed tachypnea, fever, and leukocytosis. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen with contrast was carried out. This showed a right middle lobe opacification consistent with pneumonia. A small <5 cm localized pelvic collection was noted; otherwise, the intra-abdominal organs including the spleen were unremarkable (). Blood cultures were negative. Conservative treatment with intravenous ciprofloxacin was initiated. Her condition slowly improved. However, three days later, she developed severe metabolic acidosis due to acute renal failure. She was shifted to the ICU and underwent urgent hemodialysis. Four days after starting hemodialysis, she complained of acute left upper abdominal pain and developed hypovolemic shock.
Laboratory investigations showed normochromic normocytic anemia (hemoglobin 8.7 g/dL (12-17), white cell count 20.8 × 109/L (4-11), platelet count 517 × 109/L (150-400), blood urea nitrogen 12.9 mmol/L (2.7-7.2), and creatinine 342 μmol/L (53-97)). Liver function tests showed an albumin of 14 g/L (34-50), alkaline phosphatase of 225 μ/L (54-144), prothrombin time of 16.1 (9.6-12.6), partial thromboplastin time of 36 sec. (24.3-30.2), and international normalized ratio of 1.5 (0.8-1.2).
Blood gases revealed a pH of 7.15 (7.3-7.4), pCO2 of 27 mmHg (36-46), HCO3 of 18.5 mmol/L (21-28), lactate of 1.5 mmol/L (0.5-1), and anion gap of 24.2.
A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a large subcapsular splenic hematoma with gas formation. There was no evidence of bowel perforation or obstruction ().
An emergency laparotomy was performed, and this showed a ruptured splenic hematoma. Peritoneal lavage and splenectomy were performed. Histology showed a necrotic spleen with fibrin and focal fat necrosis with no evidence of malignancy.
The patient made a slow but uneventful recovery and was eventually transferred to the nephrology unit to continue treatment for renal failure.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A female patient aged 60 years (with skin type III according to Fitzpatrick), with moderate chronic plaque psoriasis (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] =7.7), came to the dermatological clinic to receive phototherapy. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee at the University of Gothenburg and the National Data Inspection Board (approval number DNR:089–12, T285-16). The patient´s written informed consent was obtained for case details and publishing accompanying images. The patient was treated with NBUVB therapy (311 nm, according to standard protocol, 28 sessions, total dose 3.0 J/cm2 (increasing from 0.3 to 3.0 J/cm2) and psoriasis significantly improved (PASI =0.6). Four 4 mm punch biopsies were taken, one from intralesional psoriatic skin and one from perilesional healthy skin (about 2 cm from the psoriasis plaque) before and 24 hours after the last NBUVB session (). The biopsies were wrapped in aluminum foil and frozen at −70°C. Each sample was sectioned into 10 μm thin slices and placed on conductive glass slides. The whole process is illustrated in . The sections on the slides were used as they were for NLM and ToF-SIMS measurements; no treatment was done before the measurements. For histological assessment, the frozen sectioned slides were stained with H&E ().","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 26-year-old female with NYHA class III dyspnea on exertion and easy fatigability was referred for surgery with the diagnosis of congenitally corrected transposition of great arteries (CCTGA), restrictive subaortic ventricular septal defect (VSD) and severe subpulmonic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. She was on Propranolol. Clinical examination showed an acyanotic patient with low volume pulses and a grade 3/6 ejection systolic murmur over the left sternal border. Chest X-ray revealed normal heart size, left ventricular (LV) type of apex, right aortic arch, and convex left upper border, suggestive of dilated ascending aorta and normal lung vascularity.
Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed situs solitus, levocardia, AV concordance, side by side orientation of the ventricles, and an anterior leftward aorta. The aorta appeared to override the interventricular septum but no definite VSD could be seen probably because of poor echo window. The pulmonary artery was seen to arise from the right ventricle with no evidence of pulmonary stenosis. A high velocity jet was seen in the subaortic region with a gradient of 100 mmHg. Double outlet right ventricle (DORV) with severely restrictive VSD, L-malposed aorta and unrestricted pulmonary blood flow was suspected on echo.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus rhythm, right axis deviation and LV dominance. The right axis deviation in the ECG was probably due to the side by side orientation of the ventricles. Catheterization showed situs solitus, atrioventricular (AV) and ventriculoarterial (VA) concordance with L-malposed aorta, LV pressure of 215 mmHg and RV pressure of 25 mmHg. There was a gradient of 140 mmHg during pullback from LV to aorta, suggesting severe subaortic LVOT obstruction. LV angiogram [] showed severe hypertrophy of LV, long tunnel-like fixed subaortic stenosis and mid-ventricular systolic narrowing. A diagnosis of ACMGA with severe tunnel-like obstruction of the LVOT was made after catheterization. She underwent LVOT resection and LVOT enlargement with modified Konno technique (ventricular septum opened below the subaortic area with resection of hypertrophied septum, followed by closure of iatrogenic VSD with bovine pericardial patch). The abnormal segmental relationship [] necessitated a combined transaortic and transatrial approach. She had an uneventful postoperative period. Postoperative echocardiogram revealed good relief of LVOT obstruction with residual gradient of 45 mmHg, mainly at mid cavity region []. On 6 months follow up, she was asymptomatic with mild to moderate AR and LVOT turbulence with a gradient of 20 mmHg.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"The patient was a 51-yr-old woman with swelling of the extremities and bilateral ptosis on March 8, 2010. She complained of exertional dyspnea and weakness. She married at the age of 25. After that time, she developed drooping of her eyes, with the left eye drooping more than the right eye. Her symptoms persisted and they had gradually increased during about the last 10 yr. About 8 yr ago, she underwent a ptosis repair operation at a local clinic, but her symptoms were not improved. She denied a history of loss of consciousness, headache, dysphagia, dysarthria and myalgia. There was no family history of similar symptoms and no history of trauma. There was no previous history of diabetes and hypertension.
On examination, she was determined to be 151 cm in height and 48 kg in weight. The initial vital signs were a blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg, a pulse rate of 68 beats/min and a respiratory rate of 20/min. She was lethargic and had facial puffiness and no goiter. The lung and heart examinations were unremarkable. All the extremities showed pitting. She had marked bilateral ptosis, while the external ocular movements were normal (). The other cranial nerve examinations were unremarkable.
The laboratory findings were a total leucocyte count 4.75 × 103/µL with 61.6% polymorphs, a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, the random blood glucose was 124 mg/dL, the serum sodium was 130 mM/L, the potassium was 3.7 mM/L, the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 13 mg/dL, the creatinine was 0.8 mg/dL, the aspartate transaminase (AST) was 81 IU/L, the alanine transaminase (ALT) was 29 IU/L, the total bilirubin was 0.93 mg/dL, the creatine kinase (CK) was 1,195 IU/L (normal reference: 20-180 IU/L ), the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 517 IU/L (normal reference: 101-218 IU/L), the total cholesterol was 256 mg/dL, the triglyceride was 121 mg/dL, the high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was 40 mg/dL and the low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was 196 mg/dL. The urinary analysis was negative for blood and protein with using a dipstick. As the clinical findings suggested hypothyroidism and myasthenia gravis, a thyroid function test and acetylcholine receptor binding antibody test were done. The serum T3 was 0.195 ng/mL (normal reference: 0.86-2.02 ng/mL), the free T4 was 0.08 ng/dL (normal reference: 0.93-1.705 ng/dL), the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 2.08 µIU/mL (normal reference: 0.27-4.2 µIU/mL), the antimicrosomal antibody was 17 IU/mL (normal reference: 0-34 IU/mL), the antithyroglobulin antibody was 20.1 IU/mL (normal reference: 0-114 IU/mL) and the acetylcholine receptor binding antibody was negative.
Secondary hypothyroidism was suspected. We performed a careful history taking and other pituitary hormone evaluations. At the age of 26 the patient delivered her daughter and she had a history of massive postpartum vaginal bleeding. Thereafter she not resumed menses. The basal levels of other hormones were a serum cortisol of 4.03 µg/dL, the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was 29.64 pg/mL, the growth hormone (GH) was 0.06 ng/mL, the IGF-1 was 25 ng/mL (normal reference: 71-263 ng/mL), the prolactin was 1.59 ng/mL, the luteinizing hormone (LH) was 1.49 IU/L, the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was 4.91 IU/L, the E2 was 17.29 pg/mL and the testosterone was 0.02 ng/mL. The combined pituitary stimulation test, including the insulin tolerance test, the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation test and the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test showed panhypopituitarism (). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a finding of an empty sella turcica and there was no evidence of an intracranial mass, hemorrhage and aneurysm ().
Nerve conduction study (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) of the limbs reveled normal results with the exception of incidentally detected carpal tunnel syndrome. Needle EMG of the orbicularis oculi showed no evidence of dysfunction of the neuromuscular junction.
We diagnosed her as having Sheehan's syndrome, bilateral ptosis and subclinical myopathy caused by secondary hypothyroidism. Replacement with prednisolone of 10 mg/day and thyroxine (T4) 100 µg/day was started. The dose of prednisolone was decreased to 5 mg/day after 4 weeks. At 3 months follow-up, she had become euthyroid with normalized muscle enzymes. She recovered from her presenting symptoms and the bilateral ptosis was much improved ().","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 58-year-old male with comorbidities of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and gastro-esophageal reflux disease was initially referred to the gastroenterology clinic by primary care physician for the surveillance colonoscopy, and evaluation of dark colored stools.
Patient noted dark colored stools during the Christmas weekend associated with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The abdominal pain was epigastric, gradual onset, severe in intensity, nonradiating, aggravated with emesis with no specific relieving factors. Denies any hematemesis. He had colonoscopy 10 years ago and had history of colonic polyps. At the time of assessment in the clinic he denied any nausea, vomiting, and worsening abdominal pain or other symptoms.
Physical examination of cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological system was unremarkable. Vitals were within normal limits. Recent laboratory workup showed hemoglobin of 14.7 g/dl with normal renal and hepatic parameters including normal albumin levels. He has past medical history of anemia and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and Colonoscopy which revealed arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). He also has history of Alcoholic pancreatitis, alcohol dependence, smoking but no history of any drug abuse. Family history was negative for the colon cancer and stomach cancer. For gastroesophageal reflux disease, he was prescribed PPIs as needed but he was not taking it regularly due to little or no relief from them.
For the evaluation of GI bleed, he underwent colonoscopy in January 2016 which showed normal ileum, few 2–4 mm hyperplastic polyps in the sigmoid colon, and few 3 mm polyps in the rectum which had reactive lymphoid aggregate and focal epithelial hyperplasia on biopsy. Other findings included diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon and in the descending colon and nonbleeding internal hemorrhoids. In January 2016 an EGD showed normal esophagus but enlarged gastric folds and erythematous mucosa in the antrum and stomach biopsy showed gastric antral mucosa with focal mild increase of eosinophils and congestion. Three nonbleeding angioectasias were seen in the duodenum which were treated with argon plasma coagulation (APC). Mucosa biopsies were negative for H. pylori infection. For evaluation of the AVMs, Small bowel enteroscopy was done on February 2016 which showed mucosal changes in the jejunum and biopsy revealed small bowel mucosa with dilated lymphatics. EGD was repeated for polypectomy in February 2016 which showed enlarged gastric folds and were ligated. There was normal duodenal bulb and mucosal resection was successfully performed. The biopsy was consistent with fundic gland polyps.
He was referred to the gastroenterology clinic after eighteen months for abnormal abdominal computerized tomography findings of gastric wall thickening which he had for abdominal pain. This epigastric pain was gradual in onset, severe in intensity, radiating to right upper quadrant, and progressively worsened. To rule out gastric malignancy, EGD and EUS were done. EGD in September 2017 showed giant gastric folds, much larger than seen on the prior endoscopies. This is shown in . The biopsied enlarged gastric folds revealed gastric fundic mucosa with foveolar hyperplasia, dilated fundic glands and chronic gastritis which is shown in . Another gastric fundus nodule biopsy revealed gastric fundic mucosa with foveolar hyperplasia and mild chronic inflammation.
With the background of thickened gastric folds and episodes of recurrent pancreatitis, the patient underwent upper endoscopy ultrasound for the evaluation of the pancreas as well as the stomach on March 2018 which showed wall thickening in the body of the stomach. The thickening appeared to be primarily within the submucosa (Layer 3) of the stomach (). There was no sign of significant pathology in the common bile duct, gall bladder, and the main pancreatic duct.
Stomach biopsy results were consistent with Menetrier disease. Patient was followed in the clinic and explained the risks of adenocarcinoma associated with this disease.

"A 17-year-old female patient presented with a subcutaneous swelling on the flexor surface of the lower part of the left arm for last 3 weeks. The swelling was accompanied by mild pain. It was 2 cm × 2 cm, spherical in shape with well-defined margins. The swelling was freely mobile without any signs of acute inflammation. The patient did not reveal any other swelling in the body. Routine hematologic tests showed complete blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate within normal limits. Peripheral smear prepared from the patient's blood did not demonstrate any parasite. Absolute eosinophil count and eosinophil count were within normal limits (absolute eosinophil count 200/mm3, eosinophils 2%).
Clinical diagnosis of neurofibroma/lipoma was made by a treating physician and the patient was referred to the Department of Pathology for FNAC, which was done using a 10 mL syringe and a 22 gauge needle under aseptic precautions yielded pus. Aspirated material was spread on slides, air-dried, and stained with Giemsa stain and Ziehl-Neelsen stain for acid-fast bacilli.
Cytological examination of Giemsa-stained smear showed a large number of microfilaria in the background of degenerated inflammatory cells that comprised of neutrophils, eosinophils, histiocytes, and lymphocytes. The microfilaria had typical features of the presence of hyaline sheath, cephalic space, and tail end devoid of nuclei. Thus, these Wuchereria belonged to the species bancrofti [].
Ziehl-Neelsen staining did not show any acid-fast bacilli.

"A 21-year-old primigravida underwent an anomaly scan at 19 weeks of gestation. Her medical and surgical history was unremarkable. Her husband had NPS which was proven by mutation study. He was visually challenged secondary to congenital glaucoma and had undergone renal transplantation for end-stage renal disease due to focal segmental glomeruloscelrosis. He had antecubital pterygium; difficulty in abducting the shoulders; bilateral small and dislocatable patella; swan neck deformity of fingers; triangular lunules in the thumbs; dystrophy and longitudinal ridging in both thumb nails and absent skin creases on distal interphalangeal joints of the second, third and fourth fingers, and bilateral iliac horns.
Ultrasound evaluation showed a single live fetus with parameters corresponding to 19 weeks of gestation. The orientation of the long bones of the lower limbs was abnormal. There was rotational defect at the knee joint in both the lower limbs and feet were pointing towards the gluteal region. The extension at the knee joints was restricted [ and Videos , ]. Throughout the examination both the upper limbs were flexed at the elbow joint with limited extension in between []. A three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound scan was undertaken to better delineate the extent of the limb anomaly, which showed a clearer picture of the abnormal position of the limbs. The upper limb was kept flexed at the elbow and in the lower limbs the feet were pointing towards the gluteal region [Figures and ]. Based on these ultrasound findings the clinical diagnosis was NPS. When counseled regarding the findings, the couple opted for termination.
Post-abortal examination and infantogram confirmed the antenatal findings. In the lower limbs, there was a rotational defect at the knee joint and the feet were pointing posteriorly. The elbows could not be extended beyond 90° due to soft tissue contracture. In the infantogram, the tibia was seen laterally with a medial fibula due to torsion at the knee joint [].","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A six-month-old Caucasian male with no significant past medical history presented to the pediatric emergency department for a chief complaint of frequent unusual eye movements as reported by the parents. The patient began having intermittent rotary nystagmus approximately three weeks ago, and since then it progressed and became more continuous, worsened by changes in position or flashing lights from toys brought in his visual field. The parents also noticed the patient sleeping more than usual, only staying awake for an hour at a time, and had a subsequent severe regression in milestones, with an inability to roll over or sit unsupported.
Initial workup in the emergency department included a CT brain without contrast, which showed evidence of thickening of the bilateral optic nerves with associated masses and diffuse bilateral ventriculomegaly (Figure ). This finding was concerning for possible bilateral optic pathway gliomas, at which point a dedicated MRI of the brain and orbits was recommended, along with further genetic workup for possible neurofibromatosis I.
MRI of the brain and orbits confirmed these findings, showing diffuse enlargement of the optic tracts extending from the lateral geniculate nuclei to the optic chiasm and into the bilateral optic nerves, with a mass demonstrating 270º encasement of the bilateral supraclinoid internal carotid arteries and near circumferential encasement of the bilateral A1 segments of the anterior cerebral arteries (Figures , ).
These imaging findings confirmed the suspicion of bilateral optic pathway glioma, and as a result, the patient was admitted to the hospital and evaluated by both neurosurgery and pediatric hematology-oncology. Neurosurgery did not recommend any surgical intervention at the time, and the hematology-oncology team recommended proceeding with chemotherapy. His genetic testing results showed no evidence of clinically significant variants of neurofibromatosis I or II, suggesting a sporadic bilateral optic pathway glioma. The patient was then discharged and was followed up on an outpatient basis by both ophthalmology and pediatric hematology-oncology for maintenance chemotherapy with carboplatin and vincristine.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 49 years-old woman with ten-year recurrent non-bloody watery diarrhea and abdominal pain came to our observation in 2015. No family history of gastrointestinal disorders was detected. A full ileocolonscopy performed 5 years before (no biopsies collected) was normal, leading to a diagnosis of an irritable bowel syndrome, so managed with symptomatic drugs without significant clinical benefit. She had also an history of repeated endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) because of polyps’ recurrence, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease and severe eosinophilic asthma with frequent exacerbations, requiring short courses of oral corticosteroids. Over the years, it appeared that oral steroids induced also a complete relief of gastrointestinal symptoms, with a relapse at withdrawal. Therefore, the patient had repeated steroids exposure, developing dependence and several side-effects.
At admission to our department, she complained watery diarrhea (5–6 bowel movements/day) preceded by abdominal pain. Her vital signs were: SpO2 95% (room air), Temperature 35.8 °C, Heart Rate 100 bpm, Respiratory Rate 18/m, Blood Pressure 108/60 mmHg.
Physical examination was significant only for mild tenderness in the mesogastric area with intact bowel sounds. No organomegaly was found. Visual analog scale (VAS) score for abdominal pain was moderate/severe (60). Besides elevated peripheral blood eosinophil (0.38 × 109/L) laboratory tests were unremarkable. Stool examinations were negative for parasitic, bacteria and clostridium difficile infections. Pulmonary functional tests revealed a Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV1) of 63% (of predicted value), Asthma Control Test (ACT) score was 13, Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) was 93, Lund–Mackay (LM) score was 20. Baseline mean OCS dose was 15 mg of prednisone per day. Four OCS requiring asthmatic exacerbations occurred during the previous year.
An ileocolonscopy revealed a normal aspect of the mucosa of each explored segment, except for a small polyp (2 mm) in the rectum, that was removed. Biopsies collected from apparently normal mucosa showed instead an important linfoplasmacellular and granulocytic infiltrate in the lamina propria with a predominance of eosinophils (Fig. a, b).
Moreover, no significant findings emerged from gastroscopy, but biopsy specimens, collected in antrum, showed as well as the linfomonocytic and eosinophil granulocytic infiltrate disrupting the glandular structures (Fig. c).
According to the immunopathogenetic mechanisms of the diseases and in order to spare oral steroids, in 2017, we started treatment with subcutaneous MEP at the standard dose of 100 mg every 4 weeks, using the severe eosinophilic asthma schedule.
As expected, blood eosinophil count was reduced after the first administration, and became lower and lower during the next 48 weeks (30 cells/mm3). After 3 months, patient experienced a significant improvement of sinusitic, respiratory as well as gastrointestinal symptoms. FEV1 and SNOT-22 were evaluated at 6 and 12 month, showing a global improvement (75% and 95%; 51 and 21 respectively). ACT raised to 23. LM score reduced to 8 at month 12. VAS score for abdominal pain reduced to 20 after 3 months so gradually all oral corticosteroids were successfully reduced by patient. After 6 months, patient was in steroid-free clinical remission with a stool frequency of 1–2 movements/day of normal feces (type 3 according to the Bristol stool chart) and a complete resolution of abdominal pain. BMI (Body Mass Index) reduced from 28 to 23 and none asthma exacerbation occurred during the first year of treatment and until the last follow-up evaluation (24 months) [].
Endoscopies were repeated in order to obtain new biopsy specimens, showing a remission of the disease in term of eosinophilic inflammation, glands where normal and neither reactive hyperchromatic changes, nor mucin depletion can be appreciated (Fig. d–f).
Basophils activation was evaluated after 12 months of MEP, using the surface molecules CD203c, CD63 and CD125, showing a reduction of activation percentages. Results are shown in Fig. a, b []. Serum IL-5 levels (R&D Systems; sensitivity: 0.29 pg/ml) were measured at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment and are shown in Fig. . Serum IL-5 was non-quantifiable at baseline and showed an increase with peak on 6 months as expected and previously demonstrated by Pouliquen et al. in 2015 (Fig. c) [].","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 65-year-old Caucasian woman presented in March 2007 with a 3-month history of painless left-sided cervical lymphadenopathy. She denied any associated fevers, chills, loss of weight, dyspnea, dysphagia, or any other symptoms. The patient's surgical history was pertinent for a completely resected stage IA melanoma over the left shoulder 16 years before this presentation. Physical exam revealed enlarged and non-tender cervical and axillary lymph nodes without splenomegaly. A skin survey did not reveal any new nevi or concerning lesions. A complete blood picture showed a white blood cell count of 14.7 × 103/μL, an absolute lymphocyte count of 7.35 × 103/μL, hemoglobin of 13.8 g/dL, a platelet count of 258 × 103/μL, and lactate dehydrogenase of 291 U/L. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood demonstrated a monoclonal lymphocyte population expressing CD5, CD19, CD20, CD24, CD43, and CD52 with lambda light chain restriction and no increase in CD34-positive blasts. The cells were negative for CD38 and ZAP-70. Based on the above findings, the patient was diagnosed with Rai Stage I CLL and placed under observation.
Two years after her initial diagnosis, the patient presented with progressive dyspnea, associated with pleuritic chest pain and a 20 lbs weight loss over a period of 3 months. Physical examination revealed increased axillary and cervical lymphadenopathy and decreased breath sounds over the right lung. Chest X-ray revealed a large right-sided pleural effusion (Fig. ). White blood cell count was noted to be 53.4 × 103/μL, and she had an absolute lymphocyte count of 40.7 × 103/μL. The pleural fluid analysis was consistent with an exudative effusion, with increased atypical lymphocytes. Flow cytometry demonstrated a 12% clonal population consistent with the pleural involvement of CLL. The majority of the lymphocytes were CD4+ T-lymphocytes (CD4:CD8 in a ratio of 15: 1), but polymerase chain reaction failed to show any clonal T-cell receptor-γ or T-cell receptor-β gene rearrangements.
Secondary to rapid reaccumulation of pleural fluid, increasing lymphadenopathy, and rapid doubling time of lymphocyte count, the decision to treat symptomatic CLL was made. Chemotherapy with pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab did not result in any meaningful clinical response. As the patient's pleural effusion was refractory to CLL treatment, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was performed, which demonstrated diffuse nodular thickening of both visceral and parietal layers of the pleura (Fig. ). A biopsy of these lesions revealed enlarged cells with an increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and pleomorphic nuclei with occasional cherry red nucleoli (Fig. ). Immunohistochemistry studies demonstrated positive staining with HMB-45 (Fig. ) and S-100 protein. Electron microscopy revealed type II melanosomes with cross-striated lattice in an enclosed membrane (Fig. ), type III melanosomes with increased deposition of electron-dense melanin, and type IV melanosomes with highly electron-dense melanin (Fig. ). Based on the above findings, a diagnosis of malignant melanoma was made. Computed tomography of the chest revealed extensive lobulated tumor lining the entirety of the right parietal pleural surface without any evidence of parenchymal involvement. The patient's medical condition rapidly declined, and she ultimately succumbed to death before initiation of any therapy.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A healthy 37 year old IV gravida II para came to our hospital in 22 + 6 weeks of pregnancy for a second opinion with suspected placenta percreta. She has had two prior caesarean sections (the first one due to breech presentation, the second one planned repeated) and one early abortion followed by curettage. In ultrasound, the placenta praevia totalis of the anterior uterine wall showed distinct signs of placenta percreta with suspected bladder invasion. No myometrium between placenta and bladder and very irregular patterns of perfusion were observed, such as large lacunas and bridging vessels in the interface (Figs. and ). The MRI confirmed the suspected placenta percreta with no valid signs of invading other organs. She was counseled in detail about the serious risks of this diagnosis. Termination of the pregnancy was not an option for our patient. She had the urgent wish to preserve fertility due to unfinished family planning with a new partner. Segmental excision (if possible) or leaving the placenta in situ was planned. For the case of emergency, we also had her consent for hysterectomy, though. At 34 + 5 weeks of gestation, she presented with preterm contractions, secondary caesarean section through a fundal uterine incision after amniotic drainage and exteriorization of the gravid uterus [] was performed in combined neuraxial anesthesia and general anesthesia after birth without complications. Due to high risk of intraoperative bleeding, an arterial line and two 16 G peripheral vein cannulas were placed. Additionally, red blood cell concentrates as well as fresh frozen plasma were provided in theatre and cell savage, and norepinephrine was prepared in case of massive bleeding. Prophylactic tranexamic acid was applied continuously in a dosage of 15 mg/kg/bw during surgery without complications. A healthy boy of 2800 g, Apgar 8/8/8, NapH 7.31 was delivered, estimated blood loss was 500 ml. Due to extensive size of at least 10 × 8 cm of the percrete area, the placenta was left in situ. No transfusions of blood or hemostatic products were necessary and no further postpartum hemorrhage occurred.
The postoperative course remained without complications. She received an antibiotic prophylaxis with metronidazole and cefuroxime, regular blood tests for inflammation parameters and cervical swabs for bacteria were taken and showed no signs of infection, no vaginal hemorrhage occurred. She was discharged into ambulant care on day seven; weekly check-ups for infection and the antibiotic prophylaxis (400 mg of metronidazole two times a day, 500 mg of cefuroxime three times a day, oral application) were continued. Matching the antibiogram of bacteria from cervical swabs, the antibiotic therapy was changed to amoxicillin in the further course.
On day 54, she presented with vaginal bleeding. Blood tests still showed no signs of infection, in ultrasound, the placenta was in situ with reduced perfusion.
The different treatment options were discussed; embolism of the uterine arteries, hysterectomy vs. segmental uterine resection (if possible) or expectant management. On ultrasound examination, the uterus and also the percrete area presented significantly smaller, a surgical approach with uterine preservation (if possible) was planned. The preoperative blood work-up showed a reduced Quick value of 41%, increased d-dimere levels > 20 mg/l (normal range < 0.5 mg/l) and reduced fibrinogen levels of 0.59 g/l (normal range 1.6–4 g/l), so that 1 g of tranexamic acid was administered preoperatively. The hemoglobin level was 13.6 g/dl. Segmental uterine resection was performed and the uterus could be reconstructed. The bladder was not invaded as suspected in ultrasound, but surgical preparation and separation of the bladder wall from placental tissue resulted in a small bladder wall lesion which had to repaired (Figs. and ).
Right from the beginning of the surgery, a diffuse bleeding tendency was observed. The thromboelastometric analysis (ROTEM®, TEM International, Munich, Germany) at the beginning of surgery showed a prolonged clotting time (CT: 126 s (46–83 s)) as well as reduced amplitudes of the fibrinogen related clot formation at different time points [A5: 3 (5–30) mm; A10: 4 (6–21) mm; A20: 4 (6–21) mm; A30: 4 (6–21) mm] in the FIBTEM® Test (Fig. ). These results are in line with the reduced fibrinogen levels of the preoperative blood work-up. Furthermore, the INTEM® and EXTEM® analysis with prolonged clot formation times [CFT INTEM®: 151 (62–130) s; CFT EXTEM®: 178 (46–149) s.], the reduced clotting amplitudes at all time points (A5–A30; Fig. ) as well as the reduced Quick value of 41% in the preoperative blood work-up indicate an impaired coagulation due to fibrinogen consumption and a beginning DIC with a concomitant consumption of clotting factors (Fig. ) []. Hyperfibrinolysis could not be detected; TXA had been administered before, though (Fig. ). Nevertheless, an increased d-dimere level > 20 mg/l in the preoperative blood work-up suggests a sign of initially increased local hyperfibrinolysis before TXA was given. In consideration of the thromboelastometric analysis and the results of the blood work-up accompanied with ongoing intraoperative bleeding, two red blood cell concentrates (RBC) at a further decreasing hemoglobin level of 6.8 g/dl, three fresh frozen plasma units (FFP), prothrombin complex concentrate (PSSB, 1800 IE), 4 g of fibrinogen and tranexamic acid [15 mg/kg body weight (bw)] were administered until the bleeding could be controlled. A continuous application of norepinephrine in a dosage up to 0.2 μg/kg bw/min was temporally necessary for hemodynamic stabilization. Estimated blood loss was 3500 ml.
After surgery, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for 24 h without any signs of recurrent bleeding or cardiorespiratory limitations. Coagulation parameters had already normalized 8 h after the operation (Quick value 87%, fibrinogen 2.41 g/l) and the hemoglobin levels remained stable (around 8 g/dl). On day seven, the cystogram showed no persistent bladder lesion, the catheter could be removed. The patient was discharged on the seventh postoperative day (day 62 postpartum) in good health condition. Due to segmental resection of the uterine wall, we did not recommend a pregnancy for the next two years.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"We present a case of a 62-year-old male with 42-year history of small intestinal CD diagnosed at the age of 20, requiring two small bowel resection surgeries during this course of time. Our patient was solely on prednisone therapy for an extended period of time and switched to AZA (150 mg daily) for the last 21 years with relatively well controlled symptoms. During routine follow-up screening tests, he was incidentally found to have left lobe liver mass and was diagnosed with HCC for which he received left lobe hepatectomy at the age of 58. The AZA dose was reduced to 50 mg daily.
On subsequent follow-up, four years after the initial resection, he was found to have liver mass and was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. On presentation to hospital, the patient appeared well without any evidence of jaundice or stigmata of chronic liver disease. Preoperative blood work including liver profile and viral hepatitis markers was entirely normal: AST 18 U/L (<37 U/L), ALT 16 (<60 U/L), albumin 3.5 g/dL (3.5–5 g/dL), bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL (0.3–1.2 mg/dL), and INR 1.0, alpha-fetoprotein 10.3 ng/mL (<6.1 ng/mL), prothrombin time 13.3 seconds, and platelet count 210/μL.
Triple phase contrast enhanced CT of abdomen showed solitary mass in the segment 5 of the right lobe measuring 2.2 × 1.6 × 2.1 cm, with arterial enhancement and early wash out in the venous phase, and no evidence of lymphadenopathy or extrahepatic metastasis (Figures and ).
The decision toward surgical excision of the tumor was made. Patient underwent laparoscopic resection of segment 5 with no postoperative complications. Microscopically, the resected mass showed moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma without evidence of microvascular invasion ().
There was no postoperative adverse events and AZA was discontinued and patient was kept on oral budesonide.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"Our patient is an 8-year-old girl, with a positive family history for both skeletal malformations and bipolar disorders (BD). Her pre-perinatal history was uneventful. She was referred to our Unit because of learning difficulties and behavioural problems. The neurological examination did not show focal neurological deficits. Dysmorphic features were evident at the first observation. She showed several facial dimorphisms such as flat face, blepharophimosis, hypertelorism, broad nasal bridge, and high palate. Bones and joints defects were also evident: pectum excavatum, single transverse palmar crease, brachydactyly, flat foot, and stature below 25th percentile (). Because of these features, she previously underwent genetic consultation and performed array-CGH analysis revealing a chromosomic 8q22.1-q22.3 duplication (hg19/96.846.254-101.630.576x3, 101.726.279x2) encompassing the GDF6 and SDC2 genes, inherited from her father. Thus, our 8-year-old girl presented with clinical and genetic features of Leri's pleonosteosis, within a larger microduplication involving different genes not strictly related to our patient phenotype. In particular, the hypothesis of autosomal recessive optic atrophy (OPA6) was excluded by a general ophthalmologic examination and a fundus examination, since the contiguous region 8q21.13-q22.1 is responsible for recessive optic atrophy [].
She also met the DSM-5 criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), specific learning disorder, speech sound disorder, and developmental coordination disorder. In particular, she showed a highly pressured pattern of speech, difficulty in sustaining attention, high levels of activity, and low frustration tolerance. Furthermore, she presented a pattern of bipolar-like phenomena that did not meet the criteria for bipolar I, bipolar II, or cyclothymic disorder. Nevertheless, according to DSM-5 category, she met the criteria for the diagnosis of “other specified bipolar and related disorder” owing to the occurrence of hypomania episode without prior major depressive episode or a manic episode.
The clinical features are shared with both her father and her grandfather that present an overlapping duplication in the 8q22.1-q22.3 region. They show facial dimorphism (flat face, blepharophimosis, hypertelorism, and broad nasal bridge) and brachydactyly and are affected, respectively, by cyclothymic disorder and bipolar II disorder. Also her grandfather's brother received a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder. Unfortunately, he has never performed an array-CGH analysis, but he shows skeletal malformations consistent with Leri's disorder. Along paternal line of our patient, more members are affected by mood disorders associated with skeletal deformations. Unfortunately, none of them agreed to perform the array-CGH analysis, thus the information is incomplete to build a family tree chart. Nevertheless, the chromosome 8q22.1 microduplications were documented in our patient and his father and grandfather.
Our 8-year-old girl's developmental milestones had been mildly delayed. In particular, she presented a delayed achievement of the expressive language. Thus she started a speech-language therapy when she was 4-year-old and continued it for two years. During infancy, she also presented a divergent strabismus surgically treated at the age of 3 years. She also had genu recurvatum and hip developmental dysplasia (type-II Graf) within the first year of life. Our first neurological examination failed to detect major focal signs, but gross and fine coordination impairments with orofacial dyspraxia and speech phonological deficits were observed.
The behavioural observation revealed high levels of impulsivity and a persistently elated mood with increased activity and energy for most of the day. She often displayed restlessness, hyperactivity, and difficulty remaining focused. She also was more talkative than usual and prone to engage conversations with strangers in public, with an indiscriminately friendly approach and a high level of enthusiasm. On the whole, her social behaviour towards adults was often inappropriate. Furthermore, the conversation content appeared inappropriate to the contest with flight of ideas and abrupt shifts from one topic to another. She also showed amusing irrelevancies and theatrical mannerisms and an inflated self-esteem with uncritical self-confidence. Moreover, rapid shifts in mood over brief periods of time might occur. During these episodes, her mood became irritable and she presented decreased need for sleep, diminished ability to concentrate, inconclusiveness, and angry bursts when her wishes were denied.
The neuropsychological assessment included the cognitive profile (WISC IV) [], visual perception and motor coordination (VMI) [], executive functions (TOL) [], and verbal and spatial memory (Corsi test) []. The IQ score was in the low average (total IQ score 88), with the lowest score in nonverbal and fluid reasoning (perceptual reasoning index = 80). A moderate impairment was revealed in visuospatial short-term working memory (Corsi backward span = 2; −1.89 SD) and in backward verbal span (digit backward span = 2; −1.29 SD). Planning ability was largely below the average (rule violations = T > 100, >−2 SD; number of additional moves = T > 100, >−2 SD, TOL), suggesting a poor mental planning and problem-solving skills. She also showed deficits in visual perception and motor coordination skills at the visual-motor integration test (VMI Beery, 1997; standard score = 78; 7th percentile). The reading and writing tests scored below the average (oral reading speed of a text: 0.88 syllables/seconds/−2 DS; number of errors = 14/5° percentile; writing errors: −2 DS). She lacked knowledge of spelling rules that made her enable to read and write complex words. In general, she showed difficulties in managing the aspect of phonological processing which underpins the acquisition of literacy. Working out meaning from a whole sentence was another of her weaknesses due to the working memory deficit. Instead, when dealing with words in isolation, she had less difficulty in comprehension. She also showed very low concentration and attention abilities. During the assessment, she had to be constantly refocused and prompted to continue. All in all, our patient's neurodevelopment and psychiatric symptoms caused a marked impairment, especially in social relationship and in academic performance.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 79-year-old Caucasian man presented to the clinic with reduced appetite, unintentional weight loss of approximately 6 kg, and a history of fatty food intolerance. He denied any abdominal pain or febrile episodes, and physical examination was unremarkable. Biochemical investigations, however, revealed deranged liver-function tests with total bilirubin, 66 μmol/L; ALT, 122IU/L; ALP, 274IU/L; and gamma GT, 864IU/L.
An abdominal ultrasound showed a dilated common bile duct (CBD) with stones inside it. The gallbladder was not visualized, but strong echoes with acoustic shadowing were seen, suggesting a contracted gallbladder. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed stenosis of the proximal CBD and dilated intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts. Furthermore, it showed a small pseudocystic structure that was assumed to be a shrunken gallbladder.
The patient proceeded to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which showed multiple stones (the largest measuring 1.5 cm) in the CBD, which could not be removed, and so a stent was inserted (see Figure ). The gallbladder was not visualized, but this was thought to be the result of insufficient contrast. A repeated ERCP a few months later was reported as having cleared the CBD of all stones; the stent was removed, but the gallbladder had still not been visualized. As he had developed some intermittent right upper quadrant pain over this time, he was listed for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for presumed choledocholithiasis.
At laparoscopy, a small fibrous remnant was seen in the gallbladder fossa, but the gallbladder could not be found despite an extensive search of all possible ectopic sites. Conversion to an open procedure and on-table cholangiogram revealed a dilated CBD and confirmed gallbladder agenesis (see Figure ). The CBD was explored, numerous stones removed, and a T-tube was inserted.
Post-operatively, he made an uneventful recovery, and remains symptom free.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 54-year-old female patient presented to our clinic with complaints of occasional pain, numbness, and paralysis of her right hand. She began to notice weakness of her left hand that had begun 2 years earlier. She had no history of trauma and no family history of amyloid neuropathy. She had a history of ovarian tumor 25 years ago and thyroid tumor 5 years ago, both of which healed after surgical resection.
Physical examination revealed a mass 5 × 3 cm in the ulnar side of her left proximal forearm shown in Figure . The lesion was firm, nonpulsatile, and tender on palpitation. She had numbness on the ulnar side of her left hand and fingers. The 2-point discrimination test revealed that 15 mm at the lateral side of the ring finger 10 mm at the little finger. She had muscle weakness with abduction and adduction of the ring finger and the little finger, but no deficit in the range of motion in the elbow. The electrophysiological study revealed a significant decrease in the motor nerve conduction velocity of the ulnar nerve from distal to the mass to proximal to the mass. MRI revealed that the ulnar nerve was swollen longitudinally, had a spindle shape, and measured 3.0 × 2.7 cm in the axial plane and 7.2 cm longitudinally shown in Figure . The swollen lesion had a relatively homogeneous isosignal intensity on T1-weighted images and had relative heterogeneous enhancement after the intravenous administration of gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agent with the findings of flow void. Based on these findings, the differential diagnoses included a vascular malformation that surrounded and compressed the ulnar nerve. Excisional biopsy was not performed because of the risk of hemorrhage and iatrogenic nerve injury. The lesion was instead surgically explored with a longitudinal incision shown in Figure . The operative findings showed no vascular malformation; however, the ulnar nerve fascicles were swollen and degenerated. The affected lesion had changed into a yellow tissue shown in Figure . After the yellow tissue was carefully removed microscopically, approximately 7 cm defects remained between intact nerve fascicles. The resected tissue was hard and had a stick-like shape shown in Figure .
The histopathological examination showed degenerated connective tissue with diffuse eosinophilic deposition, which included calcification, ossification, and chondroid tissue shown in Figure and b. No intact nerve tissue remained. The deposit was positive for Congo red stain and appeared apple-green under polarized light, which suggested the diagnosis of amyloid neuropathy shown in Figure .
Immunohistochemical staining showed that the deposit was immunopositive for light-chain λ antibody shown in Figure . The deposit was immunonegative for amyloid A, transthyretin, and light-chain κ. Therefore, the pathological diagnosis was AL amyloidosis.
To determine the association with systemic involvement, we conducted screening examinations. Bone marrow aspiration, cerebrospinal fluid examination, echocardiography, electromyography of the legs, chest computed tomography, and MRI of the brain and legs showed negative results. Physical examination revealed no sign of macroglossia or purpura on the skin. Autonomic dysfunction, including orthostatic hypotension, was not present. The only positive results were from the blood test, which showed high serum levels of amyloid protein A (159.2 μg/mL [<8.0]).
Two months postoperatively, the patient underwent nerve transplantation for reconstruction of the ulnar nerve. The sural nerve was sacrificed from the left lower leg and transplanted to the defect of the ulnar nerve. One year postoperatively after the nerve transplantation, she had no apparent evidence of metastasis or local recurrence. There was no recovery of numbness in the ring and little finger and the muscle weakness still had no recovery.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 64-year-old man visited Jichi Medical University Hospital complaining of left eye visual loss and floaters in the right eye. He was referred to us by the Department of Allergy and Rheumatism of our hospital, having been administrated 40 mg of oral prednisolone for more than 6 weeks as treatment for interstitial pneumonia accompanying rheumatoid arthritis. His medical history included metastatic rectal cancer, intestinal obstruction, and pericarditis.
Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20 in the right eye and 8/200 in the left eye. Funduscopy revealed round yellowish-white subretinal lesions with retinal hemorrhage in both eyes ().
Laboratory studies showed elevated titers of the anti-Toxoplasma, anti-Herpes simplex virus IgG, anti-Herpes simplex virus IgM, and anti-cytomegalovirus IgG antibodies, as well as low cell lymphocyte and CD4-positive lymphocyte counts. In contrast, the white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and β-D glucan levels were not increased.
No abnormalities were noted on blood culture or whole-body contrast computed tomography.
Administration of oral anti-Toxoplasma (acetylspiramycin 1,800 mg/day) and anti-viral drugs (valganciclovir 1,800 mg/day) was initiated. However, the lesions expanded in both eyes.
Diagnostic vitrectomy of the left eye was performed 4 weeks after the initial examination. Although the vitreous fluid sample was subjected to broad-range PCR, multiplex PCR, and other culture tests, no positive results were obtained.
Based on the fundus findings, broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment (imipenem/cilastatin 2,000 mg/day and amikacin 600 mg/day) was initiated, under suspicion of bacterial infections including Nocardia. However, the lesions did not improve. Thus, antibiotics (ceftazidime 2 mg, vancomycin 1 mg, and voriconazole 0.05 mg/0.1 mL each) were injected into the vitreous cavity 6 weeks after the initial examination, and a vitreous tap was simultaneously performed. Broad-range PCR of the vitreous fluid showed 3.75×104 copies/mL of bacterial 16s ribosomal RNA, strongly suggesting bacterial infection. Albeit with antibiotic treatment, the lesions further deteriorated BCVA to light perception ().
Seven weeks after the initial examination, exenteration of the left eye was performed. Immediately after the operation, microscopic observation of the removed and then Gram-stained tissue revealed Gram-negative rods. However, no bacteria corresponding to these organisms grew in culture of either the removed tissue or vitreous fluid, and only C. albicans was isolated. Sheep blood agar and chocolate agar were used for culture and intubated with 5% carbon dioxide at 35°C for 48 hours. The picture of the Gram-stained sample was taken from this culture (, left). Then, the colonies grown on these cultures were harvested and cultivated on the CHROMagar® for identification. The picture of the agar plate shows the colonies that are green in color on the CHROMagar® suggesting the species of C. albicans based on its color (, right).
Based on these findings, mixed bacterial and fungal infection was considered, and simultaneous systemic administrations of antibiotics (levofloxacin 500 mg/day) and maximum-dose antifungal agent (fosfluconazole 600 mg/day) were initiated. In addition, antibiotics (ceftazidime 2 mg, vancomycin 1 mg, and voriconazole 0.05 mg/0.1 mL each) were injected into the vitreous cavity of the right eye three times from 8 weeks to 10 weeks after the initial examination. Broad-range PCR of the vitreous fluid obtained from simultaneous vitreous tap 8 weeks after the initial examination revealed 7.19×104 copies/mL of bacterial 16s ribosomal RNA, and 1.85×105 copies/mL of fungal 28s ribosomal RNA, suggesting a fungus-dominant mixed infection.
The subretinal abscess in the right eye expanded, approaching the central fovea (), and BCVA decreased to 2/200. Vitrectomy combined with cataract surgery and silicone oil injection was performed 10 weeks after the initial examination. C. albicans was detected by vitreous fluid culture. Systemic administration of the antifungal agent was continued after surgery, and the lesions healed under silicone oil (). The fundus had stabilized 1 year and 4 months after the initial examination, and BCVA was maintained at 4/200.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"This is a 15-year-old boy with compound heterozygous LDLR c.313+1G>A and a deletion spanning exon 1–6. Both parents have HeFH with no evidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The patient was diagnosed at the age of 2 years old as a result of the presence of xanthomas. LDL-C levels were found to be elevated to 982 mg/dL, and diagnosis was confirmed via genetic testing. Asymptomatic aortic insufficiency was evident. Medication was commenced with atorvastatin 40 mg/day plus ezetimibe 10 mg/day. The patient received once-weekly lipoprotein apheresis, but LDL-C levels remained elevated (mean interval LDL-C 197 mg/dL). At the age of 8.5 years, chest pain led to a diagnosis of angina and a coronary bypass operation. LA was intensified to two times per week.
At 13.5 years of age, prior to the initiation of lomitapide, mean interval LDL-C levels were at 85 mg/dL with LA twice weekly, and therefore well below current treatment target. Unlike the other patients in this case series, the treatment plan for this patient was to attempt to maintain the LDL-C levels at target but to reduce the apheresis burden. Lomitapide was commenced at a dose of 5 mg/day and apheresis was decreased to once weekly. After 6 months, the lomitapide dose was intensified to 10 mg/day followed by 15 mg/day and after an additional 5 months, apheresis was reduced to Q2W. Through these modifications, LDL-C levels remained under control (nadir 62 mg/dL) (Fig. ).
No adverse events have been reported for lomitapide, liver enzymes and imaging are normal, and the patient has reported improved quality of life due to less disruption from apheresis sessions resulting in less time away from school, sports and other leisure activities. As a result, the LDL-C target levels have been maintained despite reducing apheresis burden by 75%.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 31-year-old primigravida in her 36 weeks of gestation came to our hospital with sudden dizziness, three episodes of seizure within 20 minutes followed by unconsciousness. Seizure was generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) type and each lasted for approximately 15 second. She was known case of gestational hypertension under medication of tablet Labetalol 5 mg daily. At presentation her blood pressure was 170/110 mm of Hg pulse rate 138/minute, bilateral pedal oedema with fetal heart sound 142/min. Immediately Injection Diazepam 10 mg and Magnesium sulphate 5 gm. Bolus dose followed by 2 gm. Over 40 minutes in i/v infusion was given. Patient was admitted and shifted to obstetrics Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with diagnosis of eclampsia and differential diagnosis of intracranial hemorrhage, PRES. Biochemical and laboratory tests were unremarkable except with 3+ proteinuria on urine deep stick test. Patient had recurrent seizure in ICU so, and urgent CT was advised. CT head showed low density shadow on bilateral parietal lobe, high density shadow near the top of the cerebral sulcus (shown in ). So with respect to the CT findings and clinical presentation, RPLS was diagnosed and prompt caesarian section was done without any complication. Post operatively patient had no episodes of seizures and blood pressure was controlled with medication.

"A 32-year-old Caucasian man from Switzerland was referred for further evaluation of an elevated serum ferritin, the test for which was ordered because of tiredness. His serum ferritin concentration at presentation was markedly elevated at 1314 μg/L (normal range 30-400 μg/L), but the serum transferrin saturation of 23.3% was within our laboratory reference interval (normal range 15-50%).
Our patient had no history of alcohol abuse or other metabolic diseases and no family history of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). Clinical examination revealed no abnormalities. Further laboratory evaluation showed normal liver enzymes and normal hematological parameters.
Genetic tests for HH showed a heterozygous H63D substitution in the HFE gene but wild-type sequence at the HFE C282Y locus. The histology of a liver biopsy specimen was normal, and did not show iron accumulation or steatosis. Together, these findings exclude a diagnosis of HH.
Upon further evaluation, our patient revealed a history of bilateral cataracts at four years of age. His mother, his maternal aunt and maternal grandfather had all had nuclear cataracts at an early age (Figure ). Slit-lamp examination, direct illumination and retro-illumination of his lenses showed scattered, radially oriented flecks and crystalline deposits in both lenses (Figure ).

"We report the case of a 25-year-old African-American male with OCA2, who was admitted in response to a phone call his mother made to emergency services after making threats to kill himself. The patient was admitted with symptoms of auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions of people stalking him and stealing his thoughts, self-neglect, depression, and suicidal thoughts, which, according to his mother had increased when he became medication noncompliant. He had been hospitalized and discharged one month prior at a different facility, when he had shot himself in the forehead with a BB gun in response to command auditory hallucinations. His mother called 911 when she discovered two BBs lodged in his forehead. He had been released after a two-week stay, but continued to experience command auditory hallucinations to kill himself. His mother again called 911 when he expressed his urges to attempt suicide again. Physical examination revealed the presence of one BB in his forehead, as well as nystagmus and hypopigmentation over his entire body. Social history revealed no smoking or alcohol usage, but a urine test was positive for cannabis. An inquiry into family history was made, and it was noted that the patient has a paternal female cousin with albinism (with no current signs of schizophrenia) and maternal grandmother with schizophrenia. As for his immediate family, there were no other cases of either schizophrenia or albinism among his biological parents or three siblings. According to his mother, he had previously lived a rather normal life (although more on the withdrawn side) and schizophrenic symptoms had only developed a few years prior, when he was around 22 years old.
The patient was started on risperidone, which was uptitrated to 6 mg daily, and escitalopram at 10 mg daily for ongoing depressed mood. This medication combination lessened the intensity of auditory hallucinations significantly, but he remained very depressed and isolative on the inpatient psychiatric ward, and continued to express thoughts of hopelessness. Lithium augmentation was started, and lithium was uptitrated to 900 mg daily. With the addition of lithium, the patient’s neurovegetative symptoms of depression and his sense of hopelessness lessened. He ceased to have thoughts of suicide, and began to interact with treatment staff, as well as psychotherapeutic rehabilitation activities offered on the ward. He also allowed treatment team to consult with ENT (ear, nose, and throat) services to have the BB removed from his forehead. He agreed to engage with intensive wrap-around mental health services, along with ongoing psychosocial rehabilitative treatment offered as part of outpatient mental health treatment. He returned home with his mother after his positive, cognitive, and negative symptoms of schizophrenia lessened to a degree that he no longer expressed any hopelessness or wishes to die.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 4-year-old girl was considered as having phenylketonuria (PKU) at the age of 1 month due to her less dark pigmented hair and a positive neonatal screening for Phe.
Her condition was confirmed by detecting homozygous mutation of PAH at nucleotide c.331 in exon 3 (c.331T > C) in the patient and heterozygous in both parents. The genetic sequencing was made in Beijing Kangxu Medical Research Center, Haidian District, Beijing, China. She was a term infant with a birth weight of 2700 g. There was no family history of arthritis or PKU. The baby was given a Phe-restricted diet. L-Amino acid-based medical foods (without Phe) provide ~ 80 % of the protein needs. The proportion of modified low-protein food was adjusted according to the concentration of regularly monitored blood Phe. She presented with normal motor development including walking and running, slight language delay and intellectual disability at 2 years old. At the age of 3.5 years, she presented with pain and swelling of her right ankle, right knee, and right hip joint (see Fig. ). At that time, serum Phe concentration was 22.8 mg/dL. Unresolved ankle pain and elevated serum Phe concentration prompted referral to West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University at the age of 4.5 years. She had severe pain of bilateral ankles, knees, and knuckles. She could not walk or jump. The affected joints were swollen, hot, and painful. A radiograph of the lower limbs showed bone demineralization. Laboratory investigation demonstrated an increase in Phe (19.52 mg/dL reference range: < 1.8 mg/dL), C-reactive protein (33.6 mg/L; reference range: 0-5 mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (36mm/h; reference range: < 21mm/h), tumor necrosis factor alpha (10.9pg/ml; reference range: <8.1pg/ml), and interleukin 6 (41.87pg/ml; reference range: < 5.9pg/ml), and a positive rheumatoid factor. Liver function, renal function, bone marrow biopsy smear and bone marrow culture were normal. Autoantibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anticardiolipin antibody, mycoplasma pneumoniae antibody, HLA-B27, and PPD tests were all negative. She was diagnosed with JIA and treated with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (naproxen), methotrexate and low dose prednisone. Her joint pain responded well to the therapy. The patient has had followed-up appointments every 3 months for 1 year. Now she is thriving and can walk normally, with no further complaint of joint pain.

"Patient (1) is a 3 years old female, the second in order of birth of a first cousin marriage (Figures and ). She was referred to the genetic clinic at the age of one year with a provisional diagnosis of congenital Rubella syndrome. At presentation she had jaundice of one week duration, her length was 71.5 cm (less than - 4 SD), weight was 7 Kg (less than - 4 SD), and skull circumference was 39 cm (microcephalic). She had global developmental delay (that progressed in the next years), enophthalmia with characteristic physical appearance and cutaneous photosensitivity. Abdominal examination revealed an enlarged liver (8 cm below the costal margin) firm in consistency, with rounded border and smooth surface. She had moderate ascites with bilateral shifting dullness and bilateral lower limb oedema.
ALT was 94 IU/L (normal: 37), AST: 143 IU/L (normal: 40), total bilirubin: 5.9 mg/dl, direct bilirubin: 5 mg/dl, albumin: 1.5 g/dl. Prothrombin time (PT) was prolonged with INR: 1.7. Hepatitis A virus IgM, HBsAg, HBcAb IgM, hepatitis C virus antibodies were negative; CMV, EBV and rubella (IgG and IgM) were also negative. Plasma aminoacids revealed a mild elevation of methionine: 1.3 mg/dl (normal < 0.8) and an elevation of methionine/phenylalanine ratio: 1.41 (normal < 1.0). Acylcarnitine profile was normal. Total galactose (galactose and galactose 1- phosphate combined): 1.7 mg/dl (normal <15). Galactose 1- phosphate uridyle transferase was: 71.2 uM (normal >60). DNA testing for galactosemia mutation revealed no copies of the Q188r, S135L, K285N, or L195P (classical galactosemia) or N314D (Duarte galactosemia).
Slit lamp examination revealed clear corneas and lens. Fundus examination showed pigments around the disc (bilateral retinal dystrophy). CT brain revealed central and cortical involutional brain changes. MRI brain revealed mild prominence of the brain sulci, fissures and basal cisterns with mildly dilated ventricular system more appreciated at the cerebellar hemispheres with mildly prominent cerebellar fissures. This is in addition to evidence of dysmyelinating process in the form of periventricular hyperintensity. Nerve conduction velocity and EMG showed normal studies.
The patient received ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day, vitamin E (100 mg/day), aldactone (2 mg/kg/day), vitamin K (10 mg/day) and albumin transfusion. She gradually improved over one month and was discharged from the hospital on aldactone (12.5 mg/12 hrs) and vitamin K (10 mg once daily). Her investigations on discharge were: total bilirubin: 3.6 mg/dl, direct bilirubin: 2.1 mg/dl, albumin: 4 g/dl, AST: 54 IU/L, ALT: 100 IU/L, and normal PT.

"A 26-year-old female with NYHA class III dyspnea on exertion and easy fatigability was referred for surgery with the diagnosis of congenitally corrected transposition of great arteries (CCTGA), restrictive subaortic ventricular septal defect (VSD) and severe subpulmonic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. She was on Propranolol. Clinical examination showed an acyanotic patient with low volume pulses and a grade 3/6 ejection systolic murmur over the left sternal border. Chest X-ray revealed normal heart size, left ventricular (LV) type of apex, right aortic arch, and convex left upper border, suggestive of dilated ascending aorta and normal lung vascularity.
Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed situs solitus, levocardia, AV concordance, side by side orientation of the ventricles, and an anterior leftward aorta. The aorta appeared to override the interventricular septum but no definite VSD could be seen probably because of poor echo window. The pulmonary artery was seen to arise from the right ventricle with no evidence of pulmonary stenosis. A high velocity jet was seen in the subaortic region with a gradient of 100 mmHg. Double outlet right ventricle (DORV) with severely restrictive VSD, L-malposed aorta and unrestricted pulmonary blood flow was suspected on echo.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus rhythm, right axis deviation and LV dominance. The right axis deviation in the ECG was probably due to the side by side orientation of the ventricles. Catheterization showed situs solitus, atrioventricular (AV) and ventriculoarterial (VA) concordance with L-malposed aorta, LV pressure of 215 mmHg and RV pressure of 25 mmHg. There was a gradient of 140 mmHg during pullback from LV to aorta, suggesting severe subaortic LVOT obstruction. LV angiogram [] showed severe hypertrophy of LV, long tunnel-like fixed subaortic stenosis and mid-ventricular systolic narrowing. A diagnosis of ACMGA with severe tunnel-like obstruction of the LVOT was made after catheterization. She underwent LVOT resection and LVOT enlargement with modified Konno technique (ventricular septum opened below the subaortic area with resection of hypertrophied septum, followed by closure of iatrogenic VSD with bovine pericardial patch). The abnormal segmental relationship [] necessitated a combined transaortic and transatrial approach. She had an uneventful postoperative period. Postoperative echocardiogram revealed good relief of LVOT obstruction with residual gradient of 45 mmHg, mainly at mid cavity region []. On 6 months follow up, she was asymptomatic with mild to moderate AR and LVOT turbulence with a gradient of 20 mmHg.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 37-year-old African American female with a history of two unprovoked deep venous thromboses (DVT) treated with apixaban was evaluated for a pruritic rash of two weeks' duration. She had started apixaban two months prior to the rash onset; there were otherwise no changes in her medication regimen. The exam showed hyperpigmented brown scaly plaques with central atrophic patches on the conchal bowl of the ears (Figure ), violaceous nodules, and indurated plaques with scattered flaccid vesicles on the medial thighs, knees, and antecubital fossae (Figures , ), and eroded plaques with dry, serosanguinous crust on the elbows. Vesicles were not appreciated on non-lesional skin and there was no mucosal involvement. She endorsed hematuria and weight loss but denied lesion photosensitivity. Laboratory analysis was significant for leukopenia (WBC of 3.4 thousands/μL), anemia (hemoglobin of 5.6 g/dL), and proteinuria. Serology was positive for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (>1:160), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), anti-Smith, anti-Ro/SSA, cardiolipin antibody, beta2 glycoprotein antibody, and low C3 and C4 complement.
A 4-mm punch biopsy of a representative lesion from the medial knee was performed. Histopathologic findings suggested early SCLE and consisted of basilar vacuolar degeneration with scant dermal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate (Figure ). Colloidal iron staining highlighted mucin deposition throughout the superficial and deep dermis (Figure ). Apixaban was discontinued and warfarin initiated. Triamcinolone 0.01% was used as needed for her skin.

"A 65-year-old obese woman (gravida 3 and para 2) presented to a private clinic with a complaint of vaginal bleeding for 3 months, having been menopausal since age 55. The result of Pap smear was atypical glandular cells, favor neoplastic with negative HPV (human papillomavirus) DNA test. The patient had history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Her medications included estrogen replacement therapy and aspirin for 4 years.
She was referred to the Yonsei University Wonju Severance Christian Hospital for definitive diagnosis and therapy. Abdominal computed tomography revealed uterus didelphys with complete duplication of uterine horn and cervices and suspicious 2.0×1.7-cm-sized, oval-shaped relatively soft tissue mass in right cervix. Abdominal ultrasonography result showed mild fatty liver change with two hepatic cysts in S6 (0.7 cm) and S7 (2.2 cm). PET-CT (positron emission tomography-computed tomography) revealed focal FDG (fludeoxyglucose) uptakes in the left uterine cavity.
Uterine endometrial and cervical biopsies were performed. The endometrial biopsy revealed malignant tumor, suggestive of undifferentiated carcinoma while cervical and endocervical biopsies showed inflammatory change.
Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and staging workup (bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection and pelvic washings) were performed. At the time of surgery, it was determined that the patient had a bicornuate uterus. Gross examination revealed a bicornuate uterus () (left horn 6.5×4×3.5 cm, right horn 7×4×3 cm) with a single cervix (4×3.5×3 cm). On opening, the entire endometrium of left horn showed an ill-defined white-gray granular mass, measuring about 6×4×0.5 cm (). The endometrium of right horn was grossly unremarkable with focal granular irregularity in the lower uterine segment. The myometrium revealed two small leiomyomas in the right horn, measuring 2 cm in diameter in the larger one. The attached bilateral ovaries and tubes showed no gross abnormality.
Microscopic examination revealed a mixed endometrioid adenocarcinoma (80% component) () and undifferentiated carcinoma (20% component) () in the left endometrium. The endometrioid adenocarcinoma had less than 50% solid areas, hence designated as International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) grade II. Immunohistochemical stains showed positivity for EMA, CAM 5.2, estrogen and progesterone receptors in endometrioid adenocarcinoma component while undifferentiated carcinoma component showed no positivity (). The Immunohistochemical stain for cytokeratin showed diffuse positivity in endometrioid adenocarcinoma component and focal positivity in undifferentiated carcinoma component (). The tumor showed superficial invasion (0.4 cm in maximum depth) into the myometrium (2.5 cm in thickness). The endometrium of right horn showed a tiny focus of endometrioid adenocarcinoma, measuring less than 1 mm in diameter. The bilateral adnexae, parametria and pelvic lymph nodes were all free from tumor. The disease was consistent with FIGO stage IA (T1aN0Mx). Other histological findings were adenomyosis and leiomyomas in myometrium.

"Patient I was a 73-year-old man who experienced right shoulder pain for >2 months without any history of trauma. His pain progressively worsened with a waxing and waning course, despite use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and supportive physical therapy. There was no obvious improvement after injection of intra-articular corticosteroids from another hospital in the previous month. He subsequently experienced limitation of activities of daily living and night pain that worsened over time and made it impossible to sleep at night. Shoulder pain on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was 5 at rest and 7 during motion. There was no history of trauma, known chronic diseases, or alcohol and drug abuse.
On physical examination, the skin over the shoulder joint was normal, and gentle palpation around the shoulder joint did not elicit pain. There was no loss of passive motion of his shoulder joint. However, the empty-can, Neer, and Hawkin's tests were positive. All laboratory results were within normal limits. Plain radiographs revealed a hooked acromion in the supraspinatus outlet view. US revealed marked SASD bursal effusion with a full-thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon (Fig. A). To ensure an accurate diagnosis, he underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that revealed a full-thickness tear along the supraspinatus tendon with SASD bursitis.
Because the symptoms failed to resolve with conservative management, including corticosteroid injection, the authors attempted to aspirate fluid from the SASD bursa to the greatest extent possible (Fig. B). Under US guidance, 8 mL of clear bursal fluid was aspirated, and the specimen was sent for analysis. US-guided intra-articular corticosteroid injection was administered by penetrating the posterior joint capsule. A mixture of 0.5% lidocaine and 40 mg triamcinolone was injected into the shoulder joint space by visualizing the posterior intra-articular space.[ Distension of the joint cavity and SASD bursa after injection was checked to confirm that the procedure was accurate.
Bursal fluid analysis revealed normal white cell counts without crystals. Acid-fast bacillus stain and gram stain were negative. Fluid culture grew no microorganisms.
After aspiration and intra-articular injection, the symptoms abated. One month later, his pain score on VAS decreased from 5 to 2 at rest and from 7 to 3 during motion. Upon recheck 2 months after the combined procedure, patient I was satisfied with the pain relief; therefore, surgical management was not indicated.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

Extracapsular cataract extraction was done, and the capsule was spontaneously expressed. An anterior chamber implant was placed. Under topical anesthesia also, the left eye underwent phacoemulsification of the very dense nucleus. The cortex was aspirated from the center as described in the technique. A CTR was not placed as its insertion would traumatize the loose zonules. One day postoperatively the cornea was clear, and uncorrected visual acuity was 20/25. The implant was well centered. At the 1-month follow-up, moderate capsular phimosis () was observed with preservation of the central visual axis and absence of implant-donesis. This persisted at the last follow-up 6 months postoperatively.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 58-year-old female patient presented to the outpatient clinic complaining of a gradual onset of constant left knee pain of a 9-week duration after several visits to her primary care provider as well as an orthopaedic surgeon without improvement. No history of trauma was noted, and her pain was localized to the medial and anterior aspects of the knee. On examination, the patient walked with antalgic gait. Localized medial tenderness was elicited. No swelling nor signs of internal derangement were noted. She was able to extend to 0° and flex to 135°. Knee radiographs were negative with maintained joint space and without evidence of fracture or notable osteoarthritis (Figure , A). The patient was presumed to have mild degenerative joint disease; therefore, she was prescribed naproxen and was sent to physical therapy for 4 weeks. On the follow-up, the pain did not improve, and she started to complain of similar pain affecting her right knee. MRI of the left knee was done that showed a large area of acute bone marrow edema with abnormal signal intensity in the medial tibial plateau measuring 6.5 × 5.2 cm, suggestive of insufficiency fracture (Figure , A and B). The knee was placed in a hinged brace, and the patient started to use a walker for protected weight-bearing. Medial history and medications were reviewed. She had hypothyroidism, hypertension, depression, and allergic rhinitis. Her medication included levothyroxine, escitalopram, hydrochlorothiazide, and intranasal corticosteroids (fluticasone propionate [Flonase] two puffs each nostril twice a day) for several years. She never smoked and often drank 1 to 2 glasses of wine a day.
Because of persistent pain of the right knee, MRI of the right knee was done that showed similar findings but more extensive compared to the left knee with partial collapse of the medial tibial plateau (Figure , C and D). A linear T2-hyperintense signal was identified in the medical and lateral meniscus as well but without definite articular surface tear. At that time, hip radiographs were done that showed no evidence of ON, and new knee radiographs showed bilateral subchondral sclerotic lesions, with collapse of the medial tibial plateau more severe in the right knee (Figure , B). She was treated conservatively with ibuprofen, gabapentin, diphosphonate (alendronate 70 mg once a week), and physical therapy. At 8 weeks of follow-up, her knee pain had become less intense, but she started to experience disabling pain in her left ankle. Ankle radiographs were negative. She was thought to have L5/S1 left radiculopathy; therefore, she underwent left L5/S1 transforaminal epidural steroid injection under fluoroscopy, which did not provide any benefit. Because of continuing pain, MRI of the left ankle was done that showed extensive ON involving the talus and navicular bones (Figure ). The patient received additional tests including connective tissue disease workup (complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, urine analysis, serum creatinine, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, antidouble stranded DNA, lupus anticoagulant, and anticardiolipin antibodies), coagulation profile (prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen), and thrombophilia workup (antithrombin, protein C, protein S, factor V Leiden, and factor VIII) to exclude underlying diseases that were negative.
Follow-up knee radiographs showed progressive collapse of the medial tibial plateau with varus malalignment and secondary osteoarthritis bilaterally. The disease progressed to stage IV according to the Ficat and Arlet classification (Figure ) over 2 years. Staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) was performed because of progressively worsening knee pain recalcitrant to conservative treatment (Figure ). Bone histopathology confirmed bone ON. The patient recovered well after TKA, with great improvement of pain and function at the 6-month follow-up. The mean knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) pain scale improved from 38 before surgery to 83. Similarly, the mean KOOS function in daily living (ADL) scale improved from 37 before surgery to 85. The patient achieved an active range of knee motion from 0 to 128° of flexion, with no extension lag. The left ankle was treated conservatively with solid ankle-foot orthosis to provide some comfort and to postpone the ankle surgery until she recovers from the TKA. The ankle ON progressed with talar collapse and secondary degenerative arthritis of the tibiotalar and subtalar joints (Figure ).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year. Exclusion Criteria: Younger than 65 years old, having decompensated liver disease, psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance, having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy.",1
"A 50-year-old-male, presented with the complaints of left flank pain of 1 month duration. He denied having any constitutional symptoms, voiding difficulty, ejaculatory disturbances, hematuria or constipation.
Digital rectal examination revealed a mass in the region of left seminal vesicle separate from the prostate. The total leukocyte counts were within the normal limits, serum prostate specific antigen was 0.759 ng/ml and urine culture was sterile. Serum urea and creatinine values were 20 mg/dl (8-23 mg/dL) was 1 mg/dl (0.6-1.2 mg/dL), respectively. Repeat transabdominal and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) [] revealed a well-defined mass lesion, measuring 13.5 cm × 9.9 cm × 5.4 cm in size, posterior to the urinary bladder with homogeneous, hypoechoic echotexture in the region of left seminal vesicle. Prostate was normal in size and echotexture. There was moderate left hydroureteronephrosis with near normal renal parenchymal thickness and echotexture. The distal ureter was disappearing into the mass lesion. Computed tomography (CT) with contrast [Figure and ] revealed a mass with mixed cystic and solid densities in the location of left seminal vesicle. The lesion showed good post-contrast enhancement and no evidence of calcification. The terminal part of the left ureter appeared embedded within the mass lesion. The lesion was seen separate from the prostate and the left seminal vesicle wasn’t distinctly visible on the TRUS and the CT scans. Radiological opinion in view of the well-defined nature, solid-cystic, homogeneous and hypoechoic texture was that of a benign mass lesion. Since TRUS and CT gave adequate anatomical information of the lesion, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was not requested for, though that would have been the next logical step. Cystoscopy showed a trigonal bulge in the left side. Retrograde catheterization was not possible implying obstruction and or distortion of the juxtavesical ureter. Per-rectal fine needle aspiration of the mass yielded only blood and cytology of the same was inconclusive.
The lesion was explored through a lower midline incision on the abdomen. A huge mass lesion was encountered in the retrovesical location, obscuring the left seminal vesicle and involving the left ureter causing proximal dilatation. In the beginning ureter was liberated by meticulous dissection. This was followed by decompression of the tumor by scooping out of myxoid, jelly-like material after a capsulotomy. The capsule was carefully excised throughout taking care to preserve the neurovascular structure at the bladder neck. No separate seminal vesicle was made out at the culmination of tumor excision, suggesting that the former structure is the organ of origin. The right seminal vesicle was normal in appearance.
There were no post-operative complications and patient was discharged on 10th post-operative day. Histopathological examination revealed a benign schwannoma [] with degenerative changes such as foamy macrophages [] and cholesterol clefts [] and characteristic Verocay bodies []. Multiple sections did not reveal any seminal vesicle tissue within the tumor, suggesting that the tumor had completely effaced the organ. Patient was voiding well without incontinence and his erectile and ejaculatory functions are preserved. There has been no recurrence of tumor until date, that is, 2 years and 10 months after surgery.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 42-year-old previously healthy male was referred to our tertiary center complaining of high-grade fever accompanied by chills over the last 20 days. He also complained of progressively increasing breathlessness, nonproductive cough, and right-sided chest pain. There was no history of weight loss or abdominal pain. He denied smoking tobacco. On arrival at our center, he was found to be febrile and dyspneic. His pulse was 120/min, respiratory rate 28/min, and SP02 was 95% at room air. The systemic examination of the chest revealed decreased breath sounds in the right lower zone and coarse crackles in the right infrascapular region. No peripheral or deep chain lymphadenopathy was detected on physical or imaging examinations. The hematological workup showed a leukocyte count of 18,000/µl (reference range [RR]; 4000-12000/μL) with 80% polymorphs. Liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. The serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 1650 U/L (RR; 150-250U/L). The chest X-ray revealed a heterogeneous opacity in the right pulmonary lower lobe and pleural effusion, which showed to be hemorrhagic after diagnostic thoracocentesis (A). The computed tomographic (CT)-guided Tru-cut biopsy attempted in the original-attending hospital showed necrotic tissue. The thoracic CT scan after the second hospitalization revealed a well-defined irregularly, marginated, complex, non-enhancing mass in the right lung, likely pleural based with thickened visceral pleura causing collapse and consolidation of the right lung (B). The radiological differentials comprised malignant mesothelioma versus a synovial sarcoma.
A new CT-guided biopsy was attempted and showed atypical cells consistent with an underlying malignant lesion (A). The thoracocentesis revealed an exudative and hemorrhagic pleural effusion without malignant cells.
Meanwhile, the patient’s clinical condition deteriorated, he became tachypneic and developed puffiness of the face and altered sensorium and a clinical diagnosis of superior vena cava obstruction was made. He was kept on an antibiotic regimen with Piperacillin-Tazobactam, corticosteroids and controlled ventilation. Bedside 2D echocardiogram failed to evidence a pericardial tamponade, but the mass was seen compressing the right atrium and superior vena cava. On the eighth day of hospitalization, his general condition suddenly worsened, and he expired. Immediately. the autopsy was performed with the working diagnosis of a right lung mass with SVC syndrome, probably due to malignant mesothelioma or a high-grade sarcoma.
External examination revealed proptosis of eyes and midline shift of trachea to the left. On the opening of the chest cavity, the right hemithorax was replaced by a massive hemorrhagic and necrotic tumor mass, which was adherent to the chest wall. In comparison, on the left side, there were 25 ml of straw-colored pleural fluid noted with pleural sheen (A). The right lung weighed 1200 g (RR; 360-570 g), and Left lung weighed 550 g (RR; 325-480 g). The right lung was replaced by a large tumor, which was chiefly necrotic, hemorrhagic, and pulpy. Only a portion of the posterior segment of the middle lobe was noted to be intact. The tumor mass pushed the trachea to the left. The left lung was boggy and was oozing frothy blood-stained fluid. The cut section did not show any cavities, abscesses, or tumor deposits (B).
The liver was enlarged and weighed 1800 g (RR:1500-1800 g). The external surface was smooth and glistening. No nodularity was noted. The cut surface showed a nutmeg appearance suggestive of passive venous congestion. No mass lesion was identified.
The spleen was enlarged, and weighed 230 g (RR:150-200 g). External and cut surface showed congestion. Both kidneys, pancreas, stomach, intestines, heart and brain were externally and on cut sections unremarkable.
Histological examination of the lung depicted tumor cells in cohesive sheets, having a peritheliomatous arrangement amidst predominantly necrotic areas. The tumor cells were round to oval, had coarsely stippled chromatin with scant to mildly eosinophilic cytoplasm. Nucleoli were inconspicuous, and mitosis was brisk. Numerous apoptotic bodies were also noted (2C).
IHC reactions showed the tumor cells to be diffusely positive for Vimentin (strong cytoplasmic positivity), CD99 (strong membranous positivity), and FLI 1(strong nuclear positivity). The tumor cells were diffusely negative for calretinin, WT1, D240, synaptophysin, CD56, TTF1, Tdt, S-100, desmin, myogenin, BCL-2, LCA, and EMA. On Periodic Schiff stain (PAS), the cytoplasm of tumor cells showed strong magenta cytoplasmic positivity (AD). Sections from the left upper and lower lobe showed normal air-filled alveoli lined by type II pneumocytes.
No tumor deposits were seen. Sections from the right and left lobe of the liver showed features of passive venous congestion. No tumor deposits were noted. Sections from the spleen showed expansion of red pulp with attenuation of the white pulp. Final diagnosis was primary Ewing sarcoma of right lung causing SVC syndrome.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 35-year-old right-handed man who worked in a bank was admitted to hospital with complaints of neck pain and left-sided weakness. The patient had developed a sharp pain in the left side posterior aspect of his neck and occiput after a 4-hour flight, 4 weeks before presentation. At the time he felt nauseated but did not vomit, and he was treated conservatively with ultrasound and massage. The weakness began acutely after he had turned his head to one side and rapidly progressed from his left leg to his left arm. He was immediately unable to walk and subsequently began to experience tingling sensations in his right arm and leg.
There was no history of head trauma or neck manipulation, no past medical or surgical history, and no previous use of medications or previous infectious symptoms. The patient was a non-smoker, did not have diabetes and was normotensive. There was no family history of thrombophilia or venous throboembolism. Both his father and uncle had suffered from ischemic strokes in their late forties. He was born in the Philippines and had lived in Canada since early childhood.
On examination, level of consciousness, cognition and speech were normal. His blood pressure was 144/96 mmHg. The cranial nerve examination was normal. There was Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 4 out of 5 weakness affecting the left arm and left leg, with active movement possible against gravity and minimal resistance. Pinprick and temperature sensation were diminished on the right side from the second cervical vertebra (C2). Vibration and joint position were diminished on the left side below C2. The left plantar reflex was equivocal and the right was flexor. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The results of the examination were consistent with a Brown-Séquard syndrome on the left at the level of C1-C2.
Hematologic, biochemical and immunologic investigations were normal and electrocardiogram and chest radiography were unremarkable. The lumbar puncture cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein was 0.22 g/l and glucose was 4.9 mmol/l (blood glucose 8.8 mmol/l). There was one white cell, two red cells, no oligoclonal banding and no xanthrochromia in 10 ml of CSF.
T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging performed 2 days after presentation revealed a hyperintense signal associated with restrictive diffusion from the left inferior medulla and obex to the level of C2-C3, consistent with infarction (Figure ). Three-dimensional time-of-flight MR angiography showed narrowing of the left vertebral artery over the arch of C1 with a high signal parallel to the narrowed lumen, consistent with intramural hematoma and dissection (Figure ).
The patient was started on anticoagulation therapy with heparin and bridged to warfarin as secondary prevention. When the patient was discharged one month later, he was doing well, with improving, although not yet normal, strength in his left arm and leg.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 60-year-old woman presented with one year of worsening throat discomfort, intermittent cough, and dyspnea with exertion. She denied any hemoptysis, otalgia, or odynophagia. She had no other significant past medical or social history including no history of tobacco use.
A CT neck with contrast demonstrated a mass involving the anterolateral right subglottic larynx with extension along the upper cervical trachea ().
In-office flexible nasolaryngoscopy identified a fleshy pink-colored mass in the immediate right subglottis obstructing approximately 50% of the airway. She then underwent microdirect laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy for debulking and biopsy ().
Operative findings were notable for extension of the mass approximately 1 cm below the true vocal fold.
Pathologic analysis noted small B-cells positive for CD19, CD20, and PAX5 and negative for CD5, CD10, and cyclin D21. FISH was negative for the 18q21 MALT1 gene. The combination of these findings confirmed the diagnosis of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type was made.
A staging CT neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis scan was negative for metastatic disease. Following multidisciplinary tumor board review, she was recommended low-dose radiation at 24–30 Gy in 2 Gy daily fractions for approximately 3 weeks contingent upon review of a bone marrow biopsy. Bone marrow biopsy was negative, and radiation treatment was finalized as 30 Gy in 15 fractions over the course of 1 month. Treatment was completed by May 2018. Following radiation treatment, she reported mild dysphagia and dysgeusia which has improved. Her breathing has improved, and she has returned to her normal exercise tolerance. At 21-month follow-up, there was no evidence of disease on exam or imaging; however, she continues to report a mild cough intermittently with no issues with eating, drinking, or breathing.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 49-year-old woman with a medical history of hypertension, prediabetes, dyslipidemia, and histologically confirmed NASH (80% diffused steatosis with pericellular inflammation) was referred by her primary care provider for endocrine evaluation for complaint of persistent weight gain with central obesity. Two years prior to the referral she was discovered to have a left adrenal adenoma on a routine abdominal CT scan for evaluation of nephrolithiasis. Phenotypic features of overt CS (i.e., moon face, striae, buffalo hump, etc.) were not present, and biochemical evaluation of the adenoma was not performed at that time. At referral, the patient still did not have overt phenotypic features of CS. A follow-up scan revealed a stable benign left adrenal adenoma (2.9 × 1.9 × 2.5 cm) measuring 14 Hounsfield units on noncontrast CT (). The adenoma was described as lobulated with a high fat content. Baseline clinical characteristics and laboratory findings are listed in .
Results of hormonal testing were negative for pheochromocytoma and primary aldosteronism. Testing for autonomous cortisol secretion showed mildly elevated urinary free cortisol (UFC), failure to suppress cortisol on multiple 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression tests (DSTs), elevated late-night salivary cortisol, suppressed adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) on multiple tests, and low dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) ().
The patient declined adrenalectomy. Ketoconazole was not considered because of the patient's fatty liver and elevated liver enzymes. Medical therapy with mifepristone (Korlym®, Corcept Therapeutics, Menlo Park, CA) was initiated at 300 mg per day and increased to 900 mg during the 34 weeks of treatment. After 4 weeks, her antihypertensive medication (amlodipine/olmesartan medoxomil 10/20 mg) was discontinued and her blood pressure remained stable (). During the course of mifepristone treatment, she lost 16 lbs and marked improvement in her liver enzymes was noted, with complete normalization by week 20 ().
At week 20 she complained of vaginal spotting, and a pelvic ultrasound showed multiple uterine fibroids. Subsequently she elected to undergo a hysterectomy and a left adrenalectomy. Mifepristone was discontinued 2 weeks prior to the adrenalectomy. Her prediabetes remained stable during mifepristone treatment; HbA1c was 40 mmol/mol before surgery.
During the 34-week course of medical therapy with mifepristone, the patient's hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis recovered, as indicated by increases in ACTH levels from undetectable at baseline and week 16 to 2.4 pmol/L at week 24 (). She was treated postoperatively with glucocorticoid replacement (hydrocortisone 50 mg), which was tapered and discontinued within 6 weeks. Her liver enzymes remained within the normal range and there were no further changes in blood pressure and weight 1 year postoperatively. Her most recent HbA1c was 33 mmol/mol (5.2%).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 56-year-old Caucasian male presented with a sensation of swelling in the throat, hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, and slight soreness in the right side of the throat. The symptoms were present when the patient awoke in the morning and progressed in a few hours, which caused him to seek medical assistance. At the local emergency department, a swollen tongue was found and the on-call otorhinolaryngologist was contacted. The patient had no known food allergies and no previous history of angioedema or urticarial eruptions. The patient did not present any signs of anaphylaxis (e.g., urticarial eruption, pruritus, hypotension, bronchospasm, or vomiting). It was unravelled that the patient 5 years ago was taking an ACE-inhibitor as an antihypertensive drug on a daily basis and thus bradykinin mediated angioedema was suspected. The patient was immediately transferred to the department of otorhinolaryngology. On admission, the symptoms were unchanged and the vital signs were normal. Lung and heart auscultation were normal. The clinical otorhinolaryngological assessment showed a moderate angioedema of the right side of the base of the tongue, the uvula, and the right palate-pharyngeal arch. Fibre-optic assessment of the pharynx showed a moderate swelling of the right side of the lingual tonsil and a severe mucosal swelling of the right side of the hypopharynx, the piriform sinus, the right aryepiglottic fold, and the right ventricular fold. The vocal folds were unaffected. Articulation was slightly impaired by the swelling. The voice was hoarse, but the respiration was unaffected. Besides a single small and sore lymph node on the right side of the neck, there were no palpable cervical lymph nodes. A bedside sonography of the neck revealed an inconspicuous lymph node with normal hilar flow in level Ib/II equivalent to the palpable lymph node. Blood samples (electrolytes, red and white blood cell count, and C-reactive protein) were normal except for a subnormal level of P-potassium 3.0 mmol/L (3.5–4.5 mmol/L). Since there were no signs of an anaphylactic reaction, tryptase was not measured. The patient did not present with symptoms and clinical findings compatible to upper airway infection (no fever, odynophagia, mucosal hyperaemia, or lymphadenitis). The patient had earlier suffered from a single deep vein thrombosis and was known to have type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and secondary polycythaemia due to smoking. He had no positive family history for angioedema and no prior swelling episodes. The medical history did not reveal any signs of allergic disease or malignancy. Complement analysis was not performed in the acute phase, as the biochemical analysis requires several days.
On admission, 40 milligrams of corticosteroid (Solu-Medrol®) had initially been administered intravenously. However, as the history revealed, ACEi-AE was suspected and an effect of corticosteroid could not be expected and was not awaited. Treatment with antihistamine was expected to be ineffective; thus, an antihistamine was not administrated. On suspicion of ACEi-AE, 2000 units of (18 units/kg) plasma-derived C1-inhibitor concentrate (Berinert) was administered intravenously over a course of 10 minutes. The patient rapidly reported to have decreased symptoms, but a fibre-optic reassessment was not performed until 5 hours after the infusion. A significant decrease in severity of the angioedema was observed. The patient was observed in the in-patient department for 24 hours and at discharge the angioedema had completely resolved, which was confirmed by fibre-optic reassessment. At the time of admission, the patient received an ACE-inhibitor, a calcium-antagonist, acetylsalicylic acid, a statin, and a non-beta-cell stimulating antidiabetic drug (Metformin®). The patient was thoroughly instructed never to take ACE-inhibitor again. The patient was enrolled in a large international multicenter DNA sequencing study (Prediction-ADR) in which further evaluation, including DNA testing for genetic mutations in the bradykinin pathway, is currently performed.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 35-year-old mentally disabled woman with a psychiatric history of obsessive behavior in childhood and anxiety disorder consulted the dermatology department for generalized pruritus. She was diagnosed with atopic dermatitis which resolved after corticoid-based therapy. In 2005, she was referred to our department because of laterocervical lymphadenopathies and night fever with intense sweating. Body computed tomography (CT) showed supra- and infra-diaphragmatic lymphadenopathies with various abdominal masses, the most relevant being 8×6×8 cm3. A biopsy of a lymphadenopathy revealed NS classic HL. With a final diagnosis of NS HL stage IIIB with an International Prognostic Score 2, she received six cycles of ABVD chemotherapy regimen with partial response and an early relapse in March 2006 (primary refractory to ABVD). This was followed by a salvage chemotherapy regimen (two cycles of ESHAP) with no response. In September 2006, a third chemotherapy regimen (four cycles of GemOx) was initiated with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia grade 4, which led to dose-intensity failures followed by chemotherapy discontinuation and radiotherapy consolidation. One month after the last radiotherapy session, the HL progressed; so, two cycles of IFE regimen were given with stable disease. Considering the basal comorbidities of the patient, we decided to pursue a watch-and-wait policy from 2008 to 2010, treating localized areas of progression with radiotherapy and obtaining transient partial responses (). In October 2010, a new mass appeared in D8–D9, presenting with a medullar compression syndrome. After a biopsy that confirmed HL relapse, it was treated with radiotherapy and six cycles of GemOx, which led to a partial response. However, a new progression occurred in the left cervical and axillary nodes within 1 month, which was observed with a watch-and-wait policy with the consent of the family.
In May 2012, our patient presented a new clinically symptomatic disease progression confirmed by positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, requiring bendamustine 90 mg/m2 and finally reaching disease stability. In August 2014, the HL progressed again with significant B symptoms and worsening clinical status (). At this point, based on our experience of the potential role of COX-2 expression in HL, and that the patient was not a candidate for intensive chemotherapy and brentuximab was still not available in our center, we decided to start an experimental treatment with celecoxib 200 mg every 12 hours and lenalidomide 20 mg (for 3 of every 4 weeks). This regimen was obtained through a compassionate use request. Our patient received this treatment from August 2014 to January 2015 (six cycles) with unremarkable toxicity and excellent tolerance, finally showing a CR for the first time in both the interim after three cycles and the final CT/PET after six cycles (). This response was maintained in a new CT scan in August 2015. After this induction, we started 1 year of celecoxib maintenance (200 mg/12 hours) that had to be stopped because of anemia due to gastrointestinal bleeding in March 2016.
In July 2016, with the most durable response until that moment being 22 months, our patient presented a new disease relapse. CT/PET showed supra- and infra-abdominal adenopathies with associated hepatic and splenic lesions. As two different biopsies of hypermetabolic locations resulted negative and keeping in mind the asymptomatic situation of our patient, we decided to restart celecoxib 200 mg every 12 hours. In this context, the disease progressed to ascites requiring paracentesis. Biopsies were constantly negative until February 2017, when a final biopsy confirmed the persistence of HL. At that point, we decided to start brentuximab vedotin (two cycles). During the second cycle of brentuximab, the patient required intensive care admission due to a sepsis with a fatal outcome.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 62-year-old lady was found wandering in the premises of a famous temple town in Kerala. When the local police questioned her, she said that she had left her home a few days ago and would now like to return. She provided them with the telephone number and address of her residence based on which the police were able to reunite her with her family.
On her return, the family discovered that she quickly got back to her old household routine, but was unable to remember people (neighbors, local shopkeeper) and events that had taken place in the preceding weeks. She was also confused about where she had gone and what she had done when she left home, but was able to furnish proof that she had traveled by train to a temple in a neighboring state, where she had spent her childhood. As they could not understand her patches of memory loss, the family brought her for a neurological evaluation.
An interview revealed that she was treated in the outpatient unit of the hospital for a fall six weeks ago. She had fallen from the pillion seat of a scooter and had been brought to the Casualty Section for first aid. There was no loss of consciousness, headache, blurring of vision, or vomiting. She was evaluated as an in-patient for possible post-traumatic sequelae. Medical examination revealed that she was hypertensive, but not on regular treatment. A neurological evaluation at that stage revealed no anomalies in her cognition or behavior. The CT scan and profile on blood investigations were within normal limits.
On this follow up, the Mini Mental State Examination score was 27. With no neurological problems elicited on examination and investigation, a working diagnosis of pseudo-dementia was made and a course of anti-depressants was prescribed.
On follow up, there was improvement in her mood, but the amnesia persisted. She was therefore referred for evaluation, to the clinical psychologist.
In this patient, there were no neurological or behavioral symptoms in the immediate post-traumatic period, except for mild features of a depressive disorder. The question here would be whether absence of “positive findings” could truly rule out organic causes for such impulsivity in behavior. A referral to the mental health practitioner is sometimes a resisted step in the treatment process, especially in a country such as India. It is only when the investigations rule out organicity, that “psychogenicity” of a symptom is considered.
In appearance, she was an obese lady who appeared anxious and tearful. She was initially unwilling to answer questions and repeatedly said that she could not remember what had happened. Speech was slow, but relevant and coherent. Mood was depressed; there was guilt and ideas of hopelessness. There were no hallucinations or delusions. Apart from deficits in semantic memory, there were no anomalies in primary mental functions.
On account of her apparent distress while answering questions, sessions of hypnosis were attempted. However, we encountered resistance and therefore, a supportive client-centered approach was adopted, with which she appeared to be more comfortable.
Formal psychometric assessment was deferred, in favor of serial Mental State Examinations.
Over the next three sessions, she was able to recall incidents of the preceding weeks. The most distressing episode according to her was the argument she had had with her husband. She felt that despite decades of managing the household and coping with several psychosocial stressors, the husband was overly critical of her. She described the intense grief she experienced that had prompted her to walk away from home. She visited several local temples before boarding a train to a famous temple town. After a day's stay there, she traveled by train to a temple in a neighboring state. It was the first time she was traveling alone by train, and she reported that she traveled ticketless on certain parts of the travel. She reported that she did not plan her movements, but seemed to instinctively move from one place to the other. It was only upon her return to her home state, after a few days that her memory “returned” and she went up to a local policeman and asked for help. She reported feeling very guilty over her “flight,” but insisted that there was no deliberate attempt to cause distress to her family. She did not remember people whom she was in contact with, during the travel, but could produce some of the tickets she had used. She had a purse with some money, but had pawned jewellery to purchase clothes and a few other necessities for herself. On her return, she was also very perplexed about the identity of some of the people around her and did not understand why she could not identify them.
There had been no incidents of similar behavior in the past; there were no reports of seizures, somnambulism, or other parasomnias. There were no differences in behavior and cognitive functions following the injury. The family described her as a quiet, responsible individual who had efficiently managed the household. Prior to her flight, she had participated actively in a family function; on her return, despite several cues, she could not recall the event or her family members who had reunited after a long while.
We considered the diagnosis of fugue because of the organized flight from home with significant disruption of her social and occupational routine, as also the absence of pre-morbid neurological or psychiatric problems and the self-remitting course of the altered behavior. The amnesia noted on her return was episodic and circumscribed (restricted to a few select people). The odd points in the case were the age and the absence of severe psychological trauma that could have precipitated the flight.
As we report the case, the client has returned to her pre-morbid level of functioning and comes regularly for follow up. She continues to be on a mild course of anti-depressants and supportive therapy. We plan to monitor her cognitive and psychiatric status over regular follow-up sessions and taper the sessions gradually if she maintains this improvement.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"An 83 year old retired Caucasian lady was admitted to a UK hospital with a recent history of back pain without any trauma. She had no significant past medical history of note and her only regular medication included a statin for cholesterol. She was a non-smoker and drunk only minimal amounts of alcohol. X-rays on admission demonstrated severe osteoporosis with multiple collapsed lumbar vertebrae. Whilst awaiting a brace and social support she developed diarrhoea and vomiting. An initial stool sample was negative for clostridium difficile serotoxin. Over the next few days her clinical condition deteriorated and by day 6 her C-reactive protein was 357. She developed abdominal distension, pain and a plain x-ray showed centralised dilated small bowel loops. A subsequent CT scan of her abdomen revealed small bowel obstruction together with mural thickening of the distal ileum (see Figure ).
Following CT the patient developed signs of localised peritonitis and underwent a laparotomy. At surgery necrosis and ischaemia was seen in a large portion of mid-ileum together with large quantities of pus and a localised perforation. A small bowel resection of 60 cm was performed. Histology revealed an acute gangrenous ileitis. Blood, urine and stool cultures were all negative but reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of stool cultures revealed Norovirus genogroup II. Immunoassay of the stool was negative for rotavirus and adenovirus. No specific testing for astrovirus was performed. Immunological testing of the histological specimens was not performed.
The patient had no prior history of vascular disease to suggest the cause of the ileitis was ischaemic enterocolitis. Furthermore despite the patient's back pain she had been mobilising around her bed in the hospital therefore it is unlikely that the cause of the ileitis was paralytic ileus secondary to immobility. The patient received only as required opiate analgesia and this was co-administered with appropriate laxative cover to avoid constipation. A diagnosis of acute gangrenous ileitis secondary to Norovirus was therefore made. It was postulated that the virus had triggered a localised inflammatory response leading to necrosis which had continued despite clearing of the virus by host immune responses. The virus was thought to be a nosocomial infection as there was no recent history of foreign travel or contact with individuals demonstrating the symptoms of gastro-enteric disease prior to admission. However antibody testing for IgG and IgM was not performed therefore the length of infection with the virus was unclear.
Following surgery the patient developed a pelvic collection requiring CT guided drainage which matured into an enterocutaneous fistula. The fistula was treated conservatively and sealed spontaneously at 10 weeks at which point she was discharged.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 57-year-old male patient presented to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, of a dental institution with a swelling in the left lower lip region for about 6 months. Swelling was uniform in consistency and painless with no other signs of inflammation. Clinical examination revealed an exophytic, nodular, reddish-purple, well-outlined lesion measuring about 1 cm × 1 cm in diameter, located on the left lower lip []. The patient had no other dentoalveolar symptoms and no sign of local infection.
Surgical excision under local anesthesia with diode laser (980 nm) was done. An elliptic incision was made to fully enucleate the lesion along with the overlying mucosa [Figure and ]. Antibiotic and analgesic therapy was given to the patient for 5 days. Antibacterial chlorhexidine gluconate rinse (0.12%) was prescribed for one week.
The specimen was fixed in 10% formalin solution. The histological examination made with hematoxylin and eosin [] and smooth muscle actin staining [] revealed the diagnosis of angioleiomyoma. The lesion was composed of large vascular channels of varying caliber, surrounded by thick walls of irregularly arranged, spindle-shaped cells []. The spindle-shaped cells showed elongated blunt-ended nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm-forming smooth muscle bundles showing interlacing patterns with collagen fibers between dilated and slit-like vascular spaces []. Whorled bundles of muscle fibers were seen fused with the vessel walls. Necrosis, atypical mitosis, and pleomorphism were not observed in the histological examination. The postoperative course of the patient was uneventful with 7 days of follow-up []. The tissue was completely healed and there was no sign of scar. There was no recurrence at 3 months of follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 78-year-old male presented with chief complaint of chronic and worsening left hip pain. Relevant history included an intertrochanteric hip fracture that had been treated one year prior with a cephalomedullary nail. Prior to hip fracture, the patient could walk without any assistive devices and was a high-functioning community ambulatory. Following the injury, the patient was limited to ambulation with the assistance of a walker. On physical examination, the left leg was significantly shorter than the right leg. Range of motion revealed an extremely limited range of the hip and impingement testing was positive. Infectious workup was negative for an infectious source. Neurological testing was unremarkable. Radiographs of the pelvis were obtained and demonstrated a hip fracture with a non-union of the intertrochanteric region of the femur, as well as penetration of the head screw through the femoral head. There was also screw penetration into the acetabulum and an LLD radiographically measured at 45 mm (Table ).
The preoperative plan included left hip THA. During surgery, computer-assisted navigation was used to assist with component placement and monitoring of changes in leg length. Intraoperative navigation measurements indicated a lengthening of 35 mm, which was confirmed on post-operative radiographs. Surgery was successful and the patient progressed well, experiencing significant pain relief and satisfaction with his surgery. He was discharged to home with a walker and within six weeks of follow-up, the patient had transitioned to walking with only a cane. At three months the patient was no longer using any assistive walking devices and at one year follow-up the patient was pain free and returned to his previous level of function prior to the hip fracture. Radiographs revealed that the left hip was well-aligned, with the left leg lengthened by 35 mm for a significantly improved post-operative LLD of 10 mm (Table , Figure ).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 39-year-old woman with history of hypercholesterolemia referred asthenia and heaviness in both legs. She had sedentary lifestyle, balanced diet and did not complain intestinal issues.
Her weight was 56 kg, height 170 cm, body mass index 19 kg/m2, waist circumference 73 cm and her blood pressure was tested at a value of 13/10 KPa.
She was born from healthy and non-consanguineous parents and her development was normal. She had not familiarity for early cardiovascular disease, and did not report personal history of hypertension, chronic kidney or liver diseases.
During her life she needed hospitalizations for a miscarriage (28 years old) and a delivery of a healthy male newborn by caesarean section (30 years old). The pedigree of her family is reported in Figure and shows the premature death of one of her brothers for unknown reasons at the age of 1 wk.
The patient’s lipid profile showed a significant elevation of the total (321 mg/dL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (161 mg/dL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (118 mg/dL) cholesterol, whereas triglyceride levels were normal. Serum apolipoprotein-A and -B were 291 mg/dL (n.v. 115 mg/dL-210 mg/dL) and 145 mg/dL (n.v. 55 mg/dL-135 mg/dL) respectively.
Since the patient and her relatives had neither clinical history nor physical signs (xanthoma and xanthelasma) of a genetic hypercholesterolemia, we studied other possible causes of her dyslipidemia through further laboratory tests. Blood count, liver and kidney function, coagulation tests, autoimmunity assays, PCR and urine dipstick were normal. Thyroid function tests displayed a subclinical hypothyroidism. Albumin level, detected by nephelometric method, was critically reduced (0.2 g/dL, n.v. 3.4 g/dL-5 g/dL) and total bilirubin was undetectable. Calcium level was 7.5 mg/dL (n.v. 8.5 mg/dL-10.1 mg/dL), total protein 5.8 g/dL (n.v. 6.4 g/dL-8.2 g/dL), pre-albumin 0.46 g/L (n.v. 0.2 g/L-0.4 g/L). Finally, serum protein electrophoresis (Figure ) showed the presence of a minimal amount of serum albumin (1.6%, n.v.55.8%-66.1%), with a simultaneous increase of the other serum protein fractions (alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2 and gamma), including transferrin (607 mg/dL, n.v. 200 mg/dL-360 mg/dL), alpha 1-antitrypsin (2.56 g/L, n.v. 0.9 g/L-2.0 g/L) and complement C4 (0.46 g/L, n.v. 0.10 g/L-0.40 g/L). Those seemed to compensate the lack of albumin[] .
These findings led us to investigate on the patient’s hypoalbuminemia. Proteinuria was excluded by normal spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio and total protein/creatinine ratio. Other possible secondary causes of hypoalbuminemia, such as inflammatory state and insufficient hepatic synthesis, were ruled out by normal laboratory tests and abdominal ultrasonography. The latter was negative except for mild hepatic steatosis. All the other examined members of the family (her parents, her brother, and her son) showed albumin level close to the upper limit of the normal range, suggesting that they may be heterozygous for a variation in the ALB[] . For the above reasons, we tested the hypothesis of CAA by mutation analysis of the ALB[]. After we obtained informed consent, we collected blood samples from all the available members of the family and two unrelated healthy volunteers as a control, and extracted genomic DNA from whole blood. For a rapid identification of variations in the ALB, we used a gel-based mutation detection strategy, which we developed and applied to the identification of many other cases of CAA[]. Shortly, we PCR amplified the fourteen genomic fragments of the ALB encompassing the fourteen coding exons and their intron-exon junctions, using the specific primer pairs described by Watkins et al[] . The fragments were then examined by heteroduplex and SSCP analysis: The combination of these two techniques usually allowed us to identify the region of ALB containing the molecular defect, which was then submitted to direct DNA sequencing[]. In the present case heteroduplex analysis clearly indicated that the only detectable change in both homozygous and heterozygous samples occurred in the 386 bp long region amplified by using PCR primers A23A and A24A encompassing exon 12 and the intron 11-exon 12 and exon 12-intron 13 junctions (Figure ). All the other members of the family are heterozygous, since they show the presence of four bands corresponding to homoduplex and heteroduplex PCR products (Figure , lanes 2, 2′, 3, 3′, 4, 4’ 5, 5’). The homozygous sample (Figure , lanes 1 and 1′) revealed only one band but with a different mobility when compared with controls (Figure , lanes 6, 7, 6′, and 7′). No variation due to conformation polymorphism could be seen under these electrophoretic conditions (data not shown). The results of the DNA sequence analysis performed on the abnormal fragment showed that our patient is homozygous for a CA deletion near the 3′ end of exon 12, at nucleotide positions c. 1614-1615, according to the Human Genome Variation Society rules, i.e,. starting from the initiator codon (Figure ). The subsequent frame-shift should give rise to a predicted translation product of 516 amino acid residues instead of the 585 found in the mature protein (p.Leu540Phefs*2), in which the sequence Cys(538)-Thr-Leu-Ser has been changed to Cys(538)-Thr-Phe-Stop. Unfortunately, we could not perform a search for this truncated variant in the serum of our patient, but no evidence was found so far for the presence of the putative albumin molecule produced in all the cases of CAA studied at the molecular level[,]. The electropherograms from the parents confirmed that they are both heterozygous for the same mutation (data not shown). This result brought to the molecular diagnosis of CAA in our patient.
Based on the biochemical findings and on the mutation analysis of the ALB the final diagnosis was CAA and hypercholesterolemia, the latter not of genetic origin.
CAA did not require albumin infusions, while hypercholesterolemia was successfully treated with atorvastatin. A low-cholesterol, low-saturated fat diet was prescribed without any significant effect on serum lipid (total cholesterol increased from 321 mg/dL to 334 mg/dL, LDL from 161 mg/dL to 192 mg/dL). Successful and well tolerated treatment with atorvastatin was started at the initial daily dose of 10 mg od, increased to 20 mg od: From baseline total and LDL cholesterol dropped by 23% and 47% respectively, HDL cholesterol increased by 22% while apolipoprotein-B decreased by 25%. Apolipoprotein-A showed no relevant modifications. This observation together with the low blood pressure might explain why, despite the high lipid levels, evident clinical signs of early atherosclerosis have not been observed in the patient[]: No plaques on carotid artery walls where found at ultrasound imaging study.
The patient undergoes clinical and laboratory follow-up twice a year. Atorvastatin treatment appears to be successful and well tolerated and so far she never needed albumin infusions.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"About 6 months before at 22 weeks of gestation, a cystic lesion was identified during a routine obstetric ultrasound examination of the pelvic area in a 23-year-old female patient without any previous discomfort. Due to the compression of the cyst on the cervix, the delivery was achieved by caesarean section. Postpartum ultrasonographic examination showed that there was a 7.5 × 8.5 cm sized thin-walled cystic lesion in the midline of the pelvic region compressing the rectum, uterus and bladder (). The origin of the lesion could not be determined during the ultrasonographic examination. The T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a thin-walled hyperintensity in the uterus, and the rectum posterior while T1-weighted images revealed a hypointense cystic lesion. The cyst was not associated with the ovaries. The fourth and fifth sacral bones were not seen. In the posterior, the cyst was communicating with the spinal subarachnoid space (). Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with sacral agenesis and anterior sacral meningocele. In addition, MRI showed that the conus medullaris ended at the 4th lumbar spine level and a distinct arcuate uterus was observed. The patient's neurological examination was normal. Complete blood count and serum biochemical tests were within normal limits.
Because she planned another pregnancy, gynecological surgeons and neurosurgeons suggested to the patient a surgical management. But she denied.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 7-year-old girl presented with a 2-week history of shoulder-tip pain, progressive fever and right upper quadrant pain. She had no history of vomiting, diarrhea or weight loss.
On examination, she was febrile and had a palpable, firm mass in the right upper quadrant. She had a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 145/min and respiratory rate of 28/ min. Blood culture was negative and did not grow any organism. Serology for cytomegalovirus (CMV), Ebstein-Barr virus, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C and hydatid was negative. Serum α-fetoprotein levels of 0 and serum HCG <2 were recorded.
USG of the abdomen [] showed a large, mixed, complex solid-cystic lesion, which was predominantly a solid lesion with a heterogenous cystic component, within the right lobe of the liver with no flow or increased vascularity on color Doppler examination. CT scan revealed a well-defined, solitary, cyst-like hepatic mass []. No definite solid mass-like component, enhancing nodule or calcification/fat was appreciated. A few hyperdense areas were seen within this cystic-looking lesion. No vascular compromise or invasion was seen. No contrast enhancement was seen. Subsequently, an MRI of the abdomen was also performed [], which revealed the hepatic lesion to be predominantly hyperintense on the T2W images, but with central areas of low signal intensity. The T1W axial images [] revealed the lesion to be iso to heterogeneously hypointense and did not show any enhancement after intravenous contrast administration []. There was thus a discordance between the predominantly solid appearance on USG and the predominantly cystic appearance on CT scan and MRI.
She underwent surgical biopsy. Immunohistochemistry was performed, which revealed that tumor cells were positive for α-1-antitrypsin and α-1-antichymotrypsin and some cells were also positive for cytokeratosis. No positivity was seen for CD10 or desmin. Several CD68-positive macrophages were found. The myxoid morphology of the lesions, the presence of eosinophilic hyaline bodies and the immunohistochemical spectrum were typical for UES of the liver []. Rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation was not seen. Based on these findings, we arrived at a final diagnosis of UES of the liver.
This patient is presently on chemotherapy (ifosfamide, doxorubicin and ondansetron) and follow-up imaging (CT scan) has revealed mild reduction in size. Future plans include surgery, if feasible, followed by radiation and postoperative chemotherapy. This is the currently accepted clinical practice.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 39-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of skin lesions involving the face, neck and extremities. The patient was diagnosed as being HIV-positive a month earlier and was commenced on antiretroviral treatment abacavir 300 mg bd, lamivudine 300 mg bd and efavirenz 600 mg once daily, because of impaired renal function or pre-renal failure. The patient was hydrated with an improvement in the renal function. Two weeks after the development of the skin lesions, the patient complained of a sore throat and hoarseness of his voice.
On clinical examination, the patient had multiple translucent, clustered, umbilicated papules and nodules in the centrofacial region and neck with necrotic centres. In addition, there were verrucous plaques and nodules on the ears and upper limbs ( and ). Chest X-ray was normal with no lung, hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes. A fibre-optic laryngoscopy revealed a supraglottitis with ulceration on the lingual surface of the epiglottis ().
Routine blood investigations demonstrated elevation of the liver enzymes with an infiltrative pattern (AST-63/ALT 70/ALP -219/Gamma GT-291). Abdominal ultrasound revealed an enlarged liver with abnormal parenchyma. The kidneys and the rest of the abdomen were normal. The initial CD4 count performed prior to the commencement of antiretrovirals was 2 cells/µL with a viral load greater than one million copies/mL. A repeat test (eight weeks later) showed a CD4 count of 124 cells/µL with a viral load of less than 20 copies/mL. Urinalysis and urine histoplasma antigen test were negative. Histology of the liver, larynx and sections of the skin demonstrated pandermal necrotising granulomatous inflammation. Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver and PAS stains revealed a relative paucity of intracellular oval, narrow-neck budding fungal organisms morphologically in keeping with Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum ( and ). Fungal culture of liver, epiglottis ulcer and skin confirmed the diagnosis of histoplasmosis.
On the basis of the clinical presentation, initial worsening of the disease and rapid elevation of the CD4+ T-cell count with lowering of the HIV viral load, the patient most likely has histoplasmosis associated IRIS. The patient was commenced on intravenous amphotericin B (0.8 mg/kg/day) for two weeks and continued with his antiretroviral treatment. He had an excellent response to this treatment and was discharged on itraconazole 100 mg twice a day.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 6-year-old boy was referred with double stream urination. Physical examination revealed the presence of the double glans accompanied by second urethral meatus positioned dorsally (). Further evaluation by voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) showed duplex bladders in the coronal plane (). The accessory bladder lies anterior to the main bladder with no evidence of vesicoureteral reflux. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan showed horseshoe kidney with acceptable cortical function in the right kidney (60%) and diffuse decrease in the cortical function of the left kidney (40%). Cystoscopy was performed and the cystoscope easily passed through the ventral meatus unlike the dorsal orifice due to severe stenosis. The right ureteral orifice drained at the entrance of the accessory bladder to the main bladder while the left orifice entered the main bladder at its normal position. However, both urethral orifices originated from the main bladder. Further study by spinal magnetic resonance imaging revealed butterfly vertebrae in L1, L2, and L3 (). Overall, the patient had bladder duplication in the coronal plane with two distinct urethras, both originating from the main bladder, accompanied by glans diphallia with dorsal stenotic urethra (). The patient was taken to surgery and the bladder was exposed through a lower midline incision. The main and accessory bladders were separated by adjacent fascia. After opening the main bladder, the septum between the two bladders was resected and the two lumens were anastomosed (). Due to the patent ventral urethra and stenotic dorsal urethra, the closure of dorsal urethra was planned. A catheter was placed in the stenotic dorsal urethra to demonstrate the orifice, and the orifice was subsequently ligated and cauterized. The biopsy of the intravesical septum revealed a muscular tissue lined by a transitional epithelium with congestion and hemorrhage. Postoperatively, the patient had good caliber urination at ventral orifice with no stream at dorsal orifice and he was discharged with good condition. The patient has no complication after 1 year follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 45-year-old male underwent a left upper lobectomy and postoperative pathology revealed invasive stage IIIA lung adenocarcinoma (). Targeted next- generation sequencing (NGS) with a customized panel (Geneseeq Prime panel) designed to target 425 cancer-specific genes was performed, and four somatic mutations and copy number alterations (CNAs) were identified, including EGFR-KDD of exon 18-25 [mutant allele frequency (MAF): 13.5%], EGFR amplification (4.5-fold), TP53 p.Y220C (MAF: 37.0%), and RB1 single copy loss (). The tumor mutation burden (TMB) was estimated to be 1.1 mutation/Mb. The patient received pemetrexed and cisplatin as adjuvant chemotherapy. Four months later, he progressed with liver metastasis in left lobe ().
Then, the patient was treated with Icotinib and the metastasis shrunk. Unfortunately, the drug resistance was observed only after 4 months, as evidenced by the fact that previously responsive liver lesion progressed. Left hepatic re-biopsy confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma and target sequencing (Geneseeq Prime panel) detected the same EGFR-KDD (MAF: 4.9%) as well as mutation of TP53 p.Y220C (MAF: 0.5%) (). The TMB was calculated as 2.2 mutation/Mb.
Docetaxel and cisplatin were initiated as the second-line therapy. However, the left hepatic metastasis enlarged rapidly after 2 cycles of chemotherapy. The blood carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level increased from 9.5 mg/ml (before chemotherapy) to 22.7 mg/ml. Even worse, a right hepatic metastasis appeared soon afterward. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of liver was conducted on both of the left and right hepatic metastases, but no reduction in liver lesions was observed, and the CEA level showed a slight increase from 7.3 to 10.3 mg/ml.
Afterward, the patient started taking Osimertinib (80 mg once daily). Encouragingly, both liver lesions showed significant regression (). One month after initiation of Osimertinib, the CEA level decreased to 5.4 mg/ml, and remained at normal level for 18 months. Moreover, the progression-free survival (PFS) reached 21 months. However, the CEA level increased to 23.1 mg/ml at the 19th month after the initiation of Osimertinib treatment, and 2 months later, the patient progressed with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes () with the CEA level of 73.9 mg/ml. Resampling and targeted sequencing (Geneseeq Prime panel) consistently identified EGFR-KDD (MAF: 33.9%), as well as EGFR amplification (6.6-fold), TP53 p.Y220C (MAF: 53.3%), and a new mutation of RELN p.G1774E (MAF: 45.4%) (). The estimated TMB increased to 3.4 mutation/Mb. In addition, the assessment of PD-L1 expression using antibody 28-8 (pharm Dx, Dako’s Platform) showed tumor proportion score (TPS) of 1%.
On these bases, the fourth-line salvage therapy using Nivolumab was prescribed and the therapeutic efficacy was considerable, as evidenced by the decreased CEA, regressed mediastinal lymph nodes, reduced metastases in both left and right liver (). Specifically, the CEA level decreased from 143.6 to 41.8 mg/ml one month later. The PFS reached 7 months and no obvious adverse effects were observed. The quality of life was in good status during the Nivolumab treatment. After that, the patient progressed with enlarged liver metastasis. Unfortunately, the patient was also infected with tuberculosis, and his condition took a sharp turn for the worse due to both tumor progression and tuberculosis. The families gave up further treatment and the patient died 4 months later.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"Menarche at age 13 years in 2007 was followed by light periods, which became heavier and regularized over the next 12 months. HPV4 was administered in February, May, and August of 2008 (Department of Health New South Wales. 2011). Cycles became irregular early in 2009 and become scant and infrequent in 2010. Menstruation ceased in January 2011 and hot flushes commenced. There was no past history of significant illness or surgery. She was a nonsmoker, took no medications, and had no history of injury. Body mass index was 22.6 kg/m2. There was no family history of premature menopause. At her initial consultation for oligomenorrhea becoming amenorrhea, she was prescribed the OCP without investigation. She was not sexually active.
She declined the OCP and consulted a second clinician. Investigations revealed that follicle-stimulating hormone was 108 U/L (menopausal range 20-140 U/L); luteinizing hormone was 31 U/L (menopausal range 10-65 U/L); estradiol was low at 63 pmol/L (normal follicular range >110 pmol/L, menopausal range = 40-200 pmol/L). Progesterone was 1.1 nmol/L (menopausal range <2.2 nmol/L). Anti-Müllerian hormone was <1.0. There were no antiovarian antibodies or antiadrenal antibodies detected. Thyroid peroxidase antibodies were 2 IU/mL and thyroglobulin antibodies were 44 IU/mL (levels up to 100 IU/mL can occur in normal subjects). A pelvic ultrasound was reported normal. Full blood count, renal, liver and thyroid function, and prolactin were normal. Premature ovarian failure was diagnosed at age 16 years. Some irregular anovulatory pattern bleeds occurred before commencement of hormone replacement therapy.
Karyotype was 46XX. Galactosemia testing was negative. Fragile X testing was normal.
This girl was counseled about the need for bone strength preservation. Her bone mineral density testing suggested femoral neck to be in the low range for age, height, and weight at 0.766 g/cm2 and lumbar spine bone mineral density to be normal for height and weight but lower than the expected range for age at 0.903 g/cm2. She is considering ovarian tissue cryopreservation.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 16-year old male presented with severe pain and swelling of right elbow joint with restricted motion for past 4 months. The pain was not controlled by medication and was worse at night. Patient underwent both MRI and 99mTc-MDP bone scans. A 99mTc-MDP bone scan showed increased flow, blood pool, and tracer uptake in the region of right elbow []. MRI showed significant joint effusion and focus of low-signal intensity on T1 [] in olecranon fossa of right humerus. A review of bone scan also revealed a tiny focal uptake in olecranon fossa [arrow, []. Thus, a diagnosis of osteoid osteoma was made. Patient then underwent surgical removal of osteoid osteoma and histopathology confirmed the diagnosis [].","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 6-year- and 9-month-old boy was referred to our hospital with a history of 6-month intractable diarrhea. Diarrhea was characterized by loose, yellow–green, or green, non-bloody, two to three times per day. The boy was born at term, and his family history was normal. Before admission to our hospital, the patient suffered aggravated watery diarrhea for 15 days, 10 times daily, abdominal pain, 5 days of fever, and a weight loss of 3 kg. Laboratory tests showed a normal eosinophil counts, normal immunoglobulin G, IgA, IgM, and IgE levels. Lymphocyte subsets analysis revealed normal proportions of CD3, CD8 T cells, decreased proportions of CD19 T cells (5.74%, reference range: 14.35–22.65%) and CD4 T cells (25.77%, reference range: 29.78–39.94%) (Table ). A slightly low absolute natural killer cells (0.26 × 109/L, reference range: 0.28–0.63 × 109/L) and a low number of CD4 T cells (0.32 × 109/L, reference range: 0.71–1.84 × 109/L) were observed (Table ). Antineutrophil cytoplasmic and other autoantibodies, including diabetes-related autoantibodies, antithyroglobulin were all negative (Table ). The patient was treated with cefoperazone–sulbactam for intestinal infection. Five days later, gastroscopy and colonscopy were performed for no improvement of symptoms. Colonscopy showed mucosal damages and ulceration, biopsy histology showed eosinophil infiltration (20–30/HP), and hyperplasia of lymphoid follicles. The patient was started with methylprednisolone for suspicion of Crohn’s disease based on colonic ulcers and biopsy pathological features. Infliximab (5 mg/kg) was given for no significant remission after methylprednisolone treatment. Then, the patient was discharged for achieving a partial remission of diarrhea. Two weeks later, he was admitted to our hospital again for second course of infliximab. Diarrhea was still presented in the patient, and characterized by bloody, mucus-containing stools. Metronidazole was started due to Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Oral methylprednisolone and deep hydrolyzed milk were given and discharged for partial improvement of symptom. Two weeks before the third admission, the boy suffered with severe watery diarrhea again, with occasionally bloody, mucus containing stools, more than 10 times per day, accompanied with abdominal pain and fever. During the third admission, vancomycin and teicoplanin were used to treat CDI, fluconazole and mycamine were used to treat Candida albicans infection which found in the mouth, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin were given to treat pneumoniae Mycoplasma. In addition, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed to treat CDI (). Albumin, gamma globulin, red cell suspension, and frozen plasma were given due to hypoproteinemia. Parenteral nutrition and enteral nutrition were supported for failure to thrive. Diarrhea, abdominal pain, mucus-containing stools, and recurrent infections were not well controlled after more than 2 months of continuous treatment. Therefore, the patient was suspicious of immunodeficiency disease and extraction of peripheral blood for immune gene panel testing. Finally, the boy was diagnosed as IPEX syndrome due to a c.1190G>A (p. R397Q) mutation in exon 11 of the FOXP3 gene (Figure A). The patient’s mother is a healthy carrier (Figure B). Two healthy siblings were excluded the same mutation by DNA Sanger sequencing (Figures C,D). At 3 months after the genetic diagnosis of IPEX, at the age of 7.5 years, the boy underwent matched sibling peripheral blood HSCT using reduced-intensity conditioning with busulfan, fludarabine, and cyclophosphamide, antithymocyte globulin. The CD34 cell dose was 7 × 106/kg, and the number of neutrophils was 3.09 × 109/L, platelets was 276 × 109/L in the day of engraftment. He continued to receive cyclosporine and methylprednisolone to prevent graft-versus-host disease. At day +14 post-HSCT, the short tandem repeat test showed that he engrafted with 100% of donor cells. Up to date, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and recurrent infections were well controlled after 6 months of HSCT, and Clostridium difficile (CD) test was negative.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"SH is a biracial male, aged 16 years old at presentation, with moderate ID (IQ =40–54) whose only medical problems were hypothyroidism diagnosed at age 5 years, constipation, and mild congenital right-sided cerebral palsy. At 13 years of age, SH developed uncharacteristic aggression and an inability to perform previously mastered tasks. Numerous antipsychotic agents were tried, all of which failed to stop his progressive decline. His parents and referring clinician attributed his decline to a trial of fluoxetine that they associated with periods of immobility lasting several minutes, chewing but not swallowing, inability to complete simple tasks, and high-frequency self-injurious behaviors. These symptoms improved but did not reverse upon discontinuation of fluoxetine. At 16 years of age, SH presented for a second opinion due to acute exacerbation of symptoms in the previous 8 to 10 weeks. Presenting symptoms included increased motor activity interspersed with episodic cessation of all activity for a few seconds, vocal stereotypies, staring spells, jerky head movements (tics), unprovoked aggression, reduced sleep, slowed and reduced food intake, and weight loss.
SH was diagnosed with unspecified catatonia. Symptoms supporting the diagnosis included episodes of both reduced and increased activity, periodic cessation of all motor activity, repetitive and meaningless utterances (also known as “verbal stereotypies” or “verbigeration”), staring, decline in skills, and a markedly slow food intake rate that resulted in progressive weight loss. Laboratory tests (complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid and liver function tests, antinuclear antibodies, thyroid antibodies, 24-hour EEGs with video recording, and MRI) were within normal limits.
Lorazepam treatment was initiated but a maximum dose of 11 mg/day did not result in consistent improvement. Subsequently, he was treated with bilateral ECT with excellent response. The parents believe that he has regained 100% of his baseline function. At the time of writing this report, he has received a total 76 bilateral electrode placement (BL ECT) over the past 18 months and continues to receive weekly maintenance treatment. So far, attempts to taper the frequency of ECT have resulted in return of symptoms. A trial of lithium, administered at a therapeutic dose and over a 1-year period, was discontinued due to the lack of additional benefit. A future trial with memantine may be considered, although this agent was not helpful in the past when administered concurrently with an antipsychotic agent.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 58-year-old man presented acutely with clinical and radiological (plain abdominal X-rays) features of SBO. There was no significant past medical history. Past surgical history included cholecystectomy and emergency laparotomy for perforated appendicitis, which were performed years ago. On physical examination, he was hemodynamically stable. His abdomen was diffusely distended and tender, with no signs of peritoneal irritation. There were no palpable masses and bowel sounds were high-pitched. No external hernias were identified. All laboratory investigations were within normal limits, including hemoglobin concentration. Given that, adhesions were considered the most likely cause. Following an unsuccessful trial of conservative management including nasogastric aspiration and intravenous fluids for 48 hours; contrasted abdominal CT was performed on day 3. This revealed a mass in the ileocecal region [], for which he subsequently underwent right hemicolectomy. Histology revealed diffuse B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma of the terminal ileum. The patient was referred for chemotherapy. Four years on, he remained disease-free.
Adhesive SBO accounts for about 1% of all emergency surgical admissions and 3.3% of all emergency laparotomies.[] It can occur any time following initial surgery.[] While management of uncomplicated adhesive SBO is largely conservative, the debate remains over the optimal duration for such non-operative management[] since only 8% of cases require surgical intervention. Confounding obstructive lesion of the intestine in patients with previous laparotomy is extremely uncommon. As adhesive SBO was the most likely diagnosis, our patient’s initial management was considered acceptable. Early high-resolution imaging may elucidate etiology and consolidate clinical management plans.[] In our patient’s case, early CT scan would have led to immediate laparotomy without delay. Therefore, if surgical intervention is deferred on clinical grounds, CT scan should be performed as soon as practicable, provided that there are no contraindications.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 65-year-old man with a 60-pack-year smoking history presented with a right middle lobe ground glass opaque (GGO) nodule which measured 1.9 cm. One year later, the nodule progressed in size to 2.8 cm (Figure ). CT scan showed there was no mediastinal adenopathy present in the chest. Transthoracic needle aspiration was performed and demonstrated atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) (Figure ). The patient was recommended to undergo right middle lobectomy, but refused and was referred for a radiation oncology consultation. The case was presented at the multidisciplinary tumor conference where there were multiple differing opinions on the future management considerations for this patient. To date, there is no evidence supporting stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) use for AAH. Observation was recommended with a serial CT scan every three months. At the two-year follow-up visit with repeat chest CT, the GGO is unchanged in appearance or size.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"We present the case of an eight-month-old Hispanic female with feeding refusal, vomiting, and poor growth. Upon presentation, her weight was at the 12th percentile and length was at the 11th percentile for age. Upper gastrointestinal contrast series revealed a congenital antral web. She was evaluated by the pediatric surgeon in Guatemala; however, the family preferred a less invasive approach. Therefore, she was referred to our institution for therapeutic endoscopy.
Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at our institution revealed a small membranous web in the antrum of the stomach, extending inward from the pylorus. Upon initial endoscopy, an Olympus GIF 160 (Olympus Co., Tokyo, Japan) endoscope with an external diameter of 8.6 mm was inserted atraumatically through a bite block and advanced through the esophagus and into the gastric antrum. Here, a congenital antral web measuring approximately 5 to 6 mm in diameter was identified (). Using a gentle torqueing maneuver, the scope was advanced beyond the web to reveal normal mucosa distally. Withdrawing the scope revealed a significant degree of antral web ablation secondary to the initial scope advancement. Controlled radial expansion balloons (CRE; Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) were then used to sequentially dilate the antral web. The balloons were advanced in to the pylorus and gradually expanded first to 9 and 10 mm, then to 11 and 12 mm, then finally to 13.5 and 15 mm for 1 to 2 minutes per session. Upon reaching a diameter of 12 mm, the balloon met resistance and endoscopic visualization through the balloon showed disruption of the mucosa to reveal muscular fibers of the normal pylorus below (). The endoscope was then slowly withdrawn, revealing ablation of the web with no unintended injury (). The patient tolerated the procedure well, and after a period of observation, she was discharged with no significant complications. Upon returning to Guatemala, she underwent a second upper endoscopy with balloon dilation of the pylorus at 13 months of age, from 12 mm up to 15 mm in diameter, without any known complications.
Two years post operatively, follow up revealed continued improved feeding tolerance without recurrence of her symptoms. The patient's weight and height plots also improved from the 11th and 12th percentile respectively at the time of presentation to above the 75th percentile.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 53-year-old, non-smoker, male patient came to our ambulatory and subsequently admitted in our Respiratory Intensive Care Unit for severe dyspnea associated with severe non-hypercapnic hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 ratio 120; PaCO2 28.5 mmHg, pH 7.485). He had a history of chronic kidney failure due to type I membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis. As the hypoxemia was refractory to high-flow oxygen-therapy (Reservoir mask with O2 at 15 liters per minute), a trial of non invasive ventilation (NIV) delivered via a full-face mask was attempted (mode Pressure-support, PS = 20 cm H2O; PEEP 8 cm H2O; FiO2 0.80); then, after 20 hours, endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation resulted mandatory due to NIV failure. Chest CT-scan showed a pattern of bilateral alveolar consolidations and ground glass areas suggesting three possible diagnostic hypotheses: Organizing pneumonia (OP), vasculitis, or Goodpasture syndrome [].
A large battery of immunological and microbiological investigations resulted negative. Fibro-bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) and transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) were performed during NIV; the histological exam of the collected tissue showed a pathologic pattern of unspecific neutrophilic capillaritis. As the patient refused to underwent surgical biopsy, the empiric therapy with intravenous pulsed bolus of cyclophosphamide and steroids was given. He died after a worsening of his clinical conditions, radiological findings, and lung gas exchange.

"The first patient, a 53 years old man, was diagnosed of high risk microgranular variant APL, presenting gingivorrhagia and fever. Anemia (Hb: 7.8 g/dL), more than 10×109/L leucocytes (11.8×109/L), and thrombocythopenia (platelets: 2.75×109/L) were present as well as coagulopathy (prothrombine time: 54%; fibrinogen: 114 mg/dL). The bone marrow aspirate showed infiltration by 93% of promyelocytes, and 80% of them were hypogranular. The diagnosis was confirmed by conventional cytogenetic, FISH and molecular studies, identifying the t(15,17) and PML/RAR (bcr3) isoform.
The patient was included in the LPA 2005 PETHEMA protocol and received idarrubicin, 12 mg/m2 on days 2, 4, 6 and 8 and ATRA, 45 mg/m2 since day 1. According to the protocol, the patient received dexamethasone at dose of 5 mg/12 hours during 15 days as DS prophylaxis because of leucocytes count at diagnosis was >5×109/L.
Twenty-four hours after stopping dexamethasone, when he had just recovered from neutropenia (neutrophils: 1.2×109/L), the patient developed fever without any clinical focus or microbiological documentation. Although wide spectrum antibiotics (piperazilin-tazobactam and teicoplanin) were administered, febrile syndrome was maintained. Six days later, on day 22, with neutrophil counts of 2.8×109/L, the patient developed hemodynamic instability with maintained hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea and oliguria with fluid retention, respiratory insufficiency and evidence of hepatic failure. The chest radiography showed bilateral alveolar infiltrates and venocapillary hypertension signs. The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and vasoactive drugs. At that moment, in absence of any microbiological documentation, late DS was suspected and ATRA was discontinued. Dexamethasone was administered and significant clinical and radiological improvement was observed 4 days after initiation. After complete recovery, ATRA was reintroduced without further complications. Eight months after achieving molecular complete remission (CR), the patient relapsed with central nervous system involvement, and promyelocytic infiltration was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Rescue therapy, that included arsenic trioxide (ATO) plus intrathecal liposomal cytarabine, leaded to achievement of molecular remission and the patient received allogeneic stem cell transplantation. At the present time, he remains and disease free, 20 months after transplantation. The second patient was a 56 years old lady, diagnosed of low risk APL based on laboratory investigation due to hemorrhagic diathesis and fever. At diagnosis she presented anemia (Hb: 7.8 g/dL), leucopenia (0.4×109/L) and thrombocytopenia (platelets: 46×109/L). The bone marrow aspirate showed 38% of blasts, all of them abnormal promyelocytes, and the diagnosis was confirmed by cytogenetic and molecular analysis, detecting t(15,17) and PML/RAR (bcr1) isoform, respectively.
She was also included in the LPA 2005 PETHEMA protocol and received idarrubicin 12 mg/m2 days 2, 4, 6 and 8 and ATRA 45 mg/m2 since day 1. Since it was classified as of low risk, no DS prophylaxis was required.
Seventeen days after treatment initiation, the patient developed fever with no clinical focus and no microbiologic documentation. Wide spectrum antibiotics (piperacilin/tazobactam, teicoplanin and amikacin) were administered without improvement. At day +22, when granulocyte count started to recover (0.350×109/L), the patient evidenced crepitants on right pulmonary base, without dyspnoea or cough. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates were observed in thorax X-ray and the computerized tomography reported the presence of bilateral pulmonary opacities, with areas of unpolished glass. This was radiologically suggestive of fungal infection and empiric treatment with B-amphotericin, cotrimoxazol and oseltamivir was given together with enlarged spectrum antibiotics.
Seven days later, on day +28, the patient developed respiratory failure with dyspnea, requiring large debit oxigenotherapy. Intensive care unit admission was required, requiring non-invasive mechanical ventilation. At that time, DS was suspected and ATRA was discontinued starting treatment with dexamethasone at dose of 10 mg twice per day. Forty-eight hours later, significant improvement was observed, with disappearance of fever and respiratory symptoms. ATRA was reintroduced during the consolidation without any further complications.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 27-year-old male presented with multiple cervical and mediastinal lymphadenopathies. The excisional biopsy disclosed classical HL, nodular sclerosis subtype, characterized by architectural effacement by nodular collagenous bands, and a mixed-population inflammatory background including numerous eosinophils admixed with Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells. Computed tomography (CT) scan of chest and pelvis revealed lymphadenopathies in bilateral neck and superior mediastinum; multiple bone lesions in T1, 2, 12, and L4 vertebrae and right ischium. Whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed multiple sites of bone and liver involvement. The diagnosis was classical HL, nodular sclerosis type, Ann Arbor stage IVEB (stage IV: diffuse or disseminated foci of involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs or tissues; E: extranodal organ involvement; B: presence of systemic symptoms like fever and loss of weight), with liver and bone metastasis. He experienced a short remission after 12 cycles of primary chemotherapy with ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) and then relapsed in para-aortic lymph nodes. After ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisolone, cytarabine, and cisplatin) salvage chemotherapy, he received subsequent high-dose BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) chemotherapy conditioning and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. However, his disease relapsed 5 months thereafter. Subsequent chemotherapeutic regimens of vinorelbine + gemcitabine and DVIP (dexamethasone, etoposide, ifosfamide, and cisplatin) only achieved a limited period of partial clinical response. Re-biopsy of the chest wall soft-tissue mass confirmed classical HL with cluster of differentiation 30 (CD30) expression. BV was then administered, but after three cycles of treatment, rapid progression occurred (). The patient experienced a severe skin reaction to subsequent lenalidomide treatment. Immunotherapy with pembrolizumab was then initiated, and his disease responded well for 16 months () until the PET scan showed progression with recurrent bony involvement and relapse (). Because of the limited options for subsequent treatment and the patient being medically unfit for allogeneic stem cell transplantation, a combination of BV and pembrolizumab was initiated, and remission was achieved for > 15 months ().","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 35 years-old male with left distal radius and ulna fracture was scheduled for closed reduction and percutaneous pinning. His Physical examination was normal. The patient did not have any past surgeries and didn’t take any medication. The patient was somewhat anxious about having surgery under general anesthesia and requested the regional anesthesia. Standard monitoring including non-invasive blood pressure recording, pulse oximetery and electrocardiography were applied and a single injection ultrasound guided infraclavicular block was implemented for the procedure. Midazolam 2 mg was given intravenously 10 minutes before the start of the block, and IV fentanyl (75 micg) before insertion of the needle was administered. We used a Honda HS – 2100 System and a 7.5-10 MHz linear ultrasound probe. The patient assumed a supine position and turned his head to the opposite side.
With the probe placed in a parasagital plane medial and inferior to the coracoids process, we obtained a clear short-axis image of the axillary artery. The entry point of the needle was anesthetized with lidocaine (3 mL, 1%). Then, using an in-plane approach, a 22 gauge, 100-mm short bevel insulated needle (pajunk, UniPlex NanoLine) was advanced and placed posterior to the axillary artery, next to the posterior cord. After reassuring that the needle tip is in correct location, and confirming a negative aspiration for blood, we slowly injected bupivacaine (30 mL, 0.25%) and dexamethasone (8 mg), and then withdrew the needle. During the injection no adverse effect was noticed. Five minutes after the injection muscle coordination in the extremity was lost and the pain diminished substantially. These were indicative of an impending successful block. After 15 minutes the surgery was allowed to start. The surgical procedure (closed reduction and percutaneous pinning) lasted 40 minutes. After the end of surgery, the patient was monitored for half an hour in the PACU and then transferred to ward.
The next morning, we were informed that the patient had not recovered completely from the motor and sensory blockade. Examination of the patient proved the same. The patient’s condition was reassessed once more 24 hours after the performance of the block. No significant change in the patient’s condition was found; complete motor and sensory blockade was persistent. Despite that the patient had no complaint about pain or paresthesia during injection of the local anesthetic and that we did not notice any unusual resistance to injection, a complete motor and sensory block in C6, C7, and C8 had remained, and the possibility of damage to nerves emerged. A nerve conduction study was requested and until then a trained nurse from acute pain service was put in charge of evaluating the patient every hour. It was approximately thirty hours after the original injection that the nurse reported the patient had felt occasional stabbing pain in his fingers. Expecting that recovery would gradually come about, the nerve conduction study was postponed to a later time in the next morning. Complete recovery of motor and sensory functions required 42 hours. Second examination of the brachial plexus 24 hours later did not reveal any residual motor or sensory blockade.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 76-year-old Chinese male, former smoker, with no other significant past medical history or other high-risk behavior and not on medications presented to the hospital for worsening right lower extremity swelling, erythema, and pain. The swelling suddenly started 3 days ago, with occasional cough and dyspnea on exertion. He denied trauma or injury to the area, fever, chills, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and dysuria. He did mention some unintentional weight loss. Physical exam was pertinent for right leg swelling, decreased breath sounds on right side, and abdominal distension.
Laboratory analysis revealed mild leukocytosis with normal differentials, mild anemia (Hb 10.6 g/dl), and a normal platelet count of 386 K/μl. His creatinine was elevated. HIV and hepatitis testing were negative. Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) serology signified a past infection. HHV-8 serology testing was not available. Bilateral Doppler ultrasound results were negative for deep vein thrombosis, and a ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan revealed a low probability for pulmonary embolism.
Renal ultrasound demonstrated moderate hydronephrosis on the right and mild hydronephrosis on the left, with no evidence of calculi in the kidney, ureters, and bladder. Computed tomography (CT) and a following positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed a mass like encasement of the proximal right ureter and bladder (Figures and ), along with retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy on the right side. Moderate to large pleural effusion was noted on the chest CT scan. Subcutaneous lymphedema was seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right lower extremity.

She has no other associated symptoms. She previously had laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) insertion 8 years prior with good result (BMI pre-procedure was 56 kg/m2, and now 36 kg/m2). Her other comorbidities include hypertension and colonic diverticular disease with previous acute diverticulitis. She was organized to have an elective colonoscopy. Colonoscopy revealed tubular foreign body embedded in the wall of colon, with an entry and exit point, ~55 cm from anal verge (Fig. ). There was also significant sigmoid and descending colon diverticular disease.
CT abdomen with oral and intravenous contrast was organized to further investigate the tubular foreign body. It revealed concurrent gastric band erosion into gastric lumen and connection tubing eroding into the posterior wall of transverse colon and exiting inferiorly (Figs –). There was no evidence of any oral contrast leak from the stomach.
This patient has previously been admitted for acute diverticulitis 4 years prior. Reviewing prior imaging did not reveal any gastric or colonic erosion. The gastric band tubing is noted to be running along the inflamed colon. Since the initial admission for acute diverticulitis, she has had multiple further acute diverticulitis episodes, which were treated with oral antibiotics. We suspect recurrent diverticulitis lead to the erosion of the gastric band into the colon and stomach.
As part of the surgical management, both colorectal and upper GI surgeon were involved in the operation. Patient underwent laparoscopic removal of gastric band and laparoscopic assisted wedge resection of transverse colon. The gastric band was removed following adhesiolysis and the gastric defect was repaired with intracorporeal suturing. The gastric band port was subsequently removed. Gastroscopy was done to ensure the repair was airtight. For the colectomy, transverse colon and splenic flexure was mobilized laparoscopically and the transverse colon was extracted through the gastric band port site for external inspection. A tract was identified passing from the antimesenteric border to colonic lumen and then along the colonic mesentery. A wedge resection performed with stapler end to side anastomosis. Flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed to confirm the anastomosis was airtight. Her post-operative recovery was uneventful, and she continued to be well on post-operative follow up in clinic. She remains well on subsequent phone follow up 12 months post operatively.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 66-year-old female was admitted to Kagawa University Hospital (Kagawa, Japan) with the complaint of intermittent epigastric pain that was exacerbated by fasting. The patient had a history of hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Physical examination upon admission revealed no anemia (via conjunctival pallor examination), jaundice or pulmonary abnormalities. On palpation, the abdomen of the patient was soft and flat, with no areas of tenderness. Furthermore, pretibial edema was not observed and superficial lymph nodes were not palpable. Serum concentrations of the tumor markers, carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9, were within the normal ranges (<5 ng/ml and 0–37 U/ml, respectively). However, X-ray examination indicated reduced gastric distension, as well as deformation of the stomach, which exhibited a leather bottle-like appearance (). In addition, the lower gastric body demonstrated luminal narrowing and increased rigidity, with a depressed lesion (longest diameter, 20 mm) at the posterior wall of the gastric antrum and abdominal computed tomography revealed thickening of the antrum. No lymphadenopathy was observed. Additionally, endoscopy revealed an ulcerative lesion covered by a white necrotic substance on the posterior wall of the antrum () and severe luminal narrowing, with poor distension of the lower gastric body. The upper gastric body, however, demonstrated good extension when compared with the middle and lower gastric bodies. The folds of the gastric antrum were flexible, stretched smoothly, and crossed one another, resulting in a waffle-like appearance on the greater curvature of the upper gastric body (). Analysis of biopsy specimens from the ulcerative lesion revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma containing signet ring cells, however, adenocarinoma was absent from biopsy specimens obtained from the abnormally crossed folds. Due to the morphological changes that occured in the gastric folds, creating the waffle-like appearance, it was determined that cancer cell invasion of the upper gastric body was likely, and a total gastrectomy was performed. The resected specimen revealed the wall thickening and crossing folds of the gastric body () that were previously observed by endoscopy. Microscopic examination revealed that cancer cells had spread throughout the upper gastric body and had infiltrated the vessels in the submucosa, predominately into the muscularis propria, and marginally into the serosa (). Immunohistochemical examination revealed positive staining for MUC5AC and MUC6 (gastric marker mucins) and negative staining for MUC2 and CD10 (intestinal marker mucins), indicating gastric-type mucin expression. The final diagnosis, according to the Japanese Classification of Gastric Carcinoma (), was T4aN3aM0, clinical stage IIIC advanced gastric cancer. The patient was discharged 17 days after surgery without complications and commenced three cycles of S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy (80 mg/day, days 1–28) for 16 weeks. Following three courses of chemotherapy for 16 weeks, treatment was terminated due to patient fatigue. The patient has survived and is without disease recurrance 14 months after surgery.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"We demonstrate this technique in a 72-year-old woman who was referred for evaluation of iron deficiency anemia. EGD was performed for evaluation and revealed a 3-cm × 3-cm flat polyp (Paris classification 0-IIa) in the second portion of the duodenum, sparing the ampulla. Capsule endoscopy and colonoscopy were subsequently performed and revealed no other polyps or etiology for anemia. The decision was made to proceed with EMR. The polyp was lifted using a mixture of 6% hetastarch and methylene blue. Complete piecemeal EMR was performed using snare cautery.
After resection, post-EMR defect margins were prophylactically treated with snare tip soft coagulation to help prevent recurrence., To reduce the risk of delayed AEs, closure of the EMR defect with endoscopic clips was attempted. Because of the large size of the resection bed, complete apposition of the 2 edges of the mucosal defect using standard endoscopic clips was not feasible. The decision was made to proceed with rubber band–assisted closure. As described, a small rubber band was attached to the first clip. The clip was then placed on the proximal edge of the lesion at the area of maximal width, fixing the rubber band in place. A second clip was used to grasp the rubber band and was then attached to the opposite edge of the defect, approximating both edges. This allowed for subsequent closure of the remaining mucosal defect by easily adding additional clips at the now approximated edges.
A total of 8 endoclips were used, achieving excellent closure. The patient was discharged home the same day. There were no AEs, including bleeding or delayed perforation. Final pathology revealed a tubulovillous adenoma with no high-grade dysplasia. Surveillance EGD 6 months later revealed no evidence of recurrent adenomatous tissue.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year. Exclusion Criteria: Younger than 65 years old, having decompensated liver disease, psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance, having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy.",1
"A 44-year-old man without systemic underlying disease suffered from painless gross hematuria combined with urine retention for days. He had LUTS for years and became worse recently. Stony-hard prostate with markedly enlarged size was found during digital rectal examination, but the PSA level was detected within the normal range (total PSA: 0.42 ng/mL). Transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) revealed multiple nodules in the prostate. The largest nodule is 6.3 cm and the whole prostate measures about 300 grams. Architecture derangement of prostate, possible central necrosis with hemorrhage, and enlarged right internal iliac lymphadenopathy were found on prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (). No bony metastasis was detected on the bone scan. We performed TRUS-guided prostate biopsy but massive gross hematuria attacked days after the procedure. Thus, cystoscopy for checking bleeding was done and the specimen resected from prostate was reported as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (). For further staging, we arranged chest computed tomography (CT), which revealed a solitary 0.9 cm nodule in the right upper lobe.
Considering the difficulty of radical surgery due to huge size of prostate, we prescribed neoadjuvant chemotherapy (5-Fluorouracil + Cisplatin + Ifosfamide) for 5 cycles. Regression of previous lung nodule was found on follow-up chest CT. Pelvic MRI revealed residual tumor lesion within the visible prostate gland, whose size regressed to 83 grams. The radical cystoprostatectomy was performed, and tumor invasion to bladder was found during operation. Bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection was also done and no metastasis was found. The pathologic diagnosis reported was consistent with MPNST.
After the operation, we prescribed adjuvant concomitant chemoradiation therapy (Cisplatin + 5-Fluorouracil + Ifosfamide with external beam radiation therapy 6600 cGy, 33 fractions). Follow-up abdominal CT done in postoperative 3 months showed multiple ill-defined poorly enhanced nodules in the liver and a 3.5 cm gallbladder mass. The target therapy, Pazopanib 400 mg per day, was given for palliative treatment due to suspect disease progression. However, his clinical condition went downhill and he expired three months later.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 62-year-old female presented with chief complaints of floaters in the right eye (RE) for 3 weeks. She was a known diabetic (on OHD) since 6 years and hypertensive since 10 years (on treatment), rheumatoid arthritis (on treatment), and with no known adverse drug reactions. Her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 4/60 in RE and 6/6 in left eye (LE). On examination, her anterior segment revealed normal findings in both the eyes except for relative afferent pupillary defect in RE. Posterior segment revealed multiple intraretinal haemorrhages all over the superior quadrant, engorged tortuous blood vessels, and CME in RE while there was no abnormality in LE. A provisional diagnosis of RE hemicentral retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) with CME was made []. Her blood pressure was 160/90 mm of Hg, and her blood investigations showed deranged lipid profile and raised blood sugar. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a central macular thickness of 551 μ with intraretinal cystic spaces and fluid []. Fundus fluorescein angiography of RE revealed capillary dropouts and nonperfusion areas corresponding to the area of vein occlusion along with angiographic CME. She received a single intravitreal injection bevacizumab following which her vision improved to 6/36. Her OCT of RE revealed a full thickness MH a month later! [ and ] She was explained about requiring surgery. Over the next 18 months, she received 5 more injections of intravitreal Bevacizumab. Her RE BCVA before vitrectomy was 6/18. A 25G vitrectomy was performed and intraoperatively posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) had to be induced, conventional internal limiting membrane peeling done and a tamponade of C3F8 (perfluoropropane) was given. Four months postsurgery, her RE BCVA 6/24 with cataract formation and MH Type 1 (U-shaped) closure was seen [ and ]. In the subsequent months, she underwent cataract extraction following which she developed CME. She underwent scatter laser (sectoral superior quadrant) in her RE along with intravitreal injection Ranibizumab three times. She has remained in regular follow-ups ever since and her BCVA has remained stable at 6/9 [].","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 62-year-old male, married, retired, with type 2 diabetes for more than 15 years, background to rheumatoid arthritis and myocardial revascularization, with no history of using alcohol or tobacco, without neuropathy, feeling pain in right foot which showed signs of dry necrosis in the plate and in the digital pulp of the third finger, and partial necrosis in the hallux reported. He Presented with distal pulses in the finger extremities, without fever, heartbeat of 80/min fc, and Pa 13 × 9 and was attended at the Diabetic Foot Treatment Center with diagnosis of type II diabetes and ischemic diabetic foot. He presented with progressive and painful necrotic plaques in the right hallux and 3rd right foot pod. The color of the feet was purple with fuming appearance. In terms of background, the patient reported treatment with a rheumatologist at the Hospital das Clínicas in São Paulo due to arthritis of the hands and coronary stent placement for 6 months at INCOR-SP. He was being medicated with prednisone, clopidogrel, and metformin.
After clinical evaluation, he was medicated with Cilostazol 50, and an arterial echo Doppler of the lower limbs was requested. This examination concluded that the arterial trunks had vascular patency with three-phase flow. There was a minor, noticeable improvement of the right toes after two months of treatment with Cilostazol but with worsening of the contralateral toes. There were fixed cyanosis and resting pain of the 3rd and 4th toes of the left foot. Even an intensive care treatment by photodynamic therapy (PDT) did not improve the condition of the diabetic foot []. After consulting his cardiologist to authorize the use of SC, this drug was administered at the daily dose of 50 mg. This treatment was maintained for 10 months, with remission of the endpoint ischemia. The patient reported feeling well, and PDT started to respond well. After 5 PDT sections, feet lesion healed and the patient regained his colored feet and reported no pain ().
One year after discharge, the patient returned again with lesion in his 1st left toe, ischemia in the 2nd right toe, with a necrotic plaque and ulcerated digital pulp, a lot of resting pain, and left lateral hallux ulcer. SC was once again administered, this time in doses of 50 mg every 12 hours (100 mg/day). After 3 months and 6 PDT sections, the 1st left toe had already healed, but the patient started to report hypoglycemia attacks. The use of Metformin and fasting was discontinued, as long as glucose levels were kept between 82 and 93 mg/dl, and SC was reduced again to 50 mg. The treatment of the 2nd finger, which was initially ulcerated, was finalized by PDT, and the patient was discharged.
During this relatively long period (more than two years), glycemia was obtained daily throughout several months, and average values are shown in . It is clear that SC allowed for a reduction and stabilization of glycemic values, with the extra benefit of having improved also the microvasculature, as indicated by the cure of the diabetic foot. It is also possible to note that there is an effect of the dose of SC, since during the 100 mg/day period, glycemia was significantly lower than in the other three periods in which the patient received a SC dose of 50 mg/day. However, as mentioned above, patient 1 under 100 mg/day of SC had an important hypoglycemic event, which was not observed at the 50 mg/day dose.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 52-year-old female presented with a lung nodule in the right lower lobe one year after living related donor kidney transplant (KT) for nail-patella syndrome in February 2020. Her post-KT course was uncomplicated, and her immunosuppressive regimen was based on tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroid. On a routine CT scan, a solitary pulmonary nodule with a small satellite lesion was accidentally found at 2 months post-KT (a). A positron emission tomography (PET) revealed high 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose-avidity with a value of standardized uptake value (SUV) of 12.3. The patient did not show any respiratory symptoms and the physical examination and laboratory results were unremarkable. Blood cultures were not performed as the patient was afebrile and the main diagnostic hypothesis was the neoplastic disease. To rule out a malignant aetiology, a CT guided transthoracic needle biopsy was performed. Histologic analysis of the specimen found granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells containing oval forms positive on PAS and Grocott staining. After deparaffination of the tissue section, we performed PCR 18S-RNA-sequencing. 18S-sequencing analysis was most consistent with the genus and species Malassezia restricta. After three-month antifungal therapy with itraconazole, a follow up CT scan showed a complete resolution of the lung nodule (b). Due to pharmacokinetic interaction between itraconazole and calcineurin inhibitors, frequent adjustments of tacrolimus dosage were needed based on through levels (max 19 ng/mL–min 7.1 ng/mL) to avoid nefrotoxicity. Renal function remained constant without any rise of creatinine levels. Maintenance therapy with oral itraconazole was continued for a month further.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 54-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to chronic, long-standing type II diabetes mellitus presented in January 2011 with decreased urine output and swelling over the whole body for 3 months. He was trained for CAPD in a stable state of health. The patient was compliant with medical care and had been free from peritonitis to date. However, he presented to the nephrology outpatient department in January 2013 with complaints of fever, abdominal pain and cloudy PD effluent. As the abdominal pain worsened, the patient was admitted to the hospital. The patient denied any contact with soil or plant material. His past medical history was uneventful except for diabetes mellitus for the past 11 years. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 140/80 mm Hg−1, temperature 100.8 ° F, pulse 72 min−1 and respiration rate 18 min−1. His head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination was unremarkable. There was no clubbing, cyanosis, lymphadenopathy or icterus. His lungs were clear and no cardiac murmur was heard. His abdomen was tender in all quadrants with rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were present and active. Pertinent laboratory values were Hgm (Hemoglobin) 7.2 gm dl−1, white blood cells (WBCs) 24000 mm−3, platelets 2.28×105 µl−1, serum creatinine 9.3 mg dl−1, serum blood urea nitrogen 45 mg dl−1, serum uric acid 4.9 mg dl−1, serum sodium 131 mmol l−1, serum potassium 3.5 mmol l−1, serum albumin 3.3 g dl−1, serum bilirubin (total) 0.45 mg dl−1, serum aspartate transaminase 19 U l−1, serum alanine aminotransferase 13 U L−1, serum alkaline phosphatase 105 U l−1, serum amylase 29 U L−1, serum calcium 8.9 mg dl−1, serum phosphorus 5 mg dl−1 and serum lactate dehydrogenase 514 U l−1. PD fluid was sent for cell count, Gram stain and culture. The WBC count in PD fluid was 6400 mm−3 with 82% neutrophils. Gram staining of the fluid showed plenty of Gram-negative bacilli. A presumptive diagnosis of CAPD peritonitis was made and empiric intraperitoneal cefazolin and tobramycin were started. PD fluid culture yielded catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, non-spore-forming and non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli. The isolate was positive for urea hydrolysis and nitrate reduction. Negative reactions were found for the production of H2S, indole, lysine decarboxylase and ornithine decarboxylase for the hydrolysis of gelatin. The identity of the isolate was confirmed as R. radiobacter sensitive to trimethoprim/sulfametoxazole, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoperazone-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, imipinem and meropenem. It was resistant only to aztreonam. Empiric antibiotic therapy was continued and the patient’s abdominal pain subsided and the peritoneal fluid counts decreased to 50 WBCs mm−3 on day 4. However, on the eighth hospital day, the patient again complained of abdominal pain and the PD fluid count increased to 300 WBCs mm−3. The catheter was therefore surgically removed and the tip sent for culture. The tip yielded growth of R. radiobacter.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A healthy 7-year-old boy was referred from the dental emergency department to the pediatric dentistry department in the Dental School of Casablanca.
Clinical examination revealed that the child has a flexible splint on maxillary teeth and a coronal restoration with a glass ionomer on 11. Radiographic examination showed incomplete root formation of both central incisors (Nolla's stage 8: short root with thin walls) ().
Based on the emergency file, it was found that the boy fell at school three weeks ago. Clinical examination revealed that 11 had a lateral luxation with an uncomplicated crown fracture and 21 had a subluxation. Emergency treatment was carried out on the same day and consisted of reattaching the tooth fragment, repositioning 11 with a gentle digital pressure, and stabilizing it with a flexible splint. One week after trauma, the patient presented with intraoral swelling on 11 revealing necrosis. Consequently, an endodontic treatment was performed and the root canal was instrumented using hand files with gentle irrigation using 0.5% sodium hypochlorite. Calcium hydroxide was placed as intracanal medication. The access cavity was sealed with glass ionomer cement.
For this purpose, the apexification technique using calcium hydroxide has been initiated on 11. The calcium hydroxide was renewed once resorbed. A regular clinical and radiological follow-up was carried out to check the vitality of 21 ().
6 months after the beginning of the treatment of 11, a radiolucent lesion in the periapical region was detected on 21 (). The negative response to the cold test confirms a pulp necrosis. Considering the immaturity of the tooth and the thinness of the root and after obtaining parental consent, the optimal treatment option was revascularization.
An access cavity was made under a dental dam. Once the canal orifice was well cleared, gentle root canal irrigation was performed with 2% sodium hypochlorite followed by irrigation with saline solution. Subsequently, the root canal was dried with large paper points until they were removed without evidence of fluids and filled with calcium hydroxide used as intracanal medication. A temporary restoration using a glass ionomer was placed.
The patient was recalled 4 weeks after the first appointment. The tooth was clinically and radiologically asymptomatic. In the second session, the tooth was anaesthetized, accessed, and irrigated gently with 2% sodium hypochlorite followed by saline solution to remove calcium hydroxide. The bleeding was induced with manual K files introduced into the root canal and placed at 2 mm beyond the working length. Once the blood clot was formed, MTA was placed in the cervical third of the root canal (). The access cavity was sealed with a glass ionomer.
Three months after performing revascularization treatment, visible root edification was observed (). The 6-month follow-up showed an important thickening of the root with calcification of the canal. Concerning 11, a renewal of the calcium hydroxide was carried out once the material has been absorbed ().
After 24 months of apexification treatment on 11, we noticed the formation of an apical barrier which was easily crossable with a file (). To solve that problem, the apical third was sealed using MTA and then the coronal two-third with warm gutta-percha. Concerning 21, the canal was almost completely obliterated with an extension of the root ().","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"The asymptomatic patient, a 60-year-old man, was referred to a radiology clinic to undergo examination for the purpose of implant planning. The panoramic radiograph revealed no important alterations in the mandible (). The patient underwent multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) (Synergy Helicoidal, General Electric Company, Milwaukee, WI), with slices and intervals of 0.625 mm, field of view 15.8 cm, matrix 512 × 512, standard filter, 120 kV and 200 mA.
The tomographic images clearly showed multiple cavitary defects, two in the anterior region (anterior variant) and one in the posterior region (posterior variant) (Figures , , and ).

"A 69-year-old female (patient 1 in ) developed a gait disturbance 6 months before admission and suffered from the gradual progression of weakness in her extremities. On admission, neurological examination showed proximal muscle weakness and reduced deep tendon reflex. Routine laboratory test results were unremarkable. Antinuclear antibodies, anti-acetylcholine (ACh) receptor antibody, and anti-voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibodies were negative. The results of chest and abdominal CT were unremarkable. In a nerve conduction study, CMAPs had slightly low amplitudes, and nerve conduction velocities were normal in the median and ulnar nerves. Needle EMG showed early recruitment and polyphasic MUPs with short durations and low amplitudes, suggesting the diagnosis of myopathy. Interestingly, the myopathic EMG findings were improved after sustained strong muscle contraction for 10 s; the MUP sizes returned to normal after a sustained strong muscle contraction, and the early recruitment of MUPs in the weak contraction was clearly normalized in the biceps brachii muscle (). Thereafter, we performed an RNS test because she complained of easy fatigability. The RNS test showed an obvious incremental response of the CMAP amplitude of the abductor digiti minimi muscle after high-rate stimulation of the ulnar nerve, indicating the diagnosis of LEMS [–]. We examined the patient for systemic malignancies, and the endoscopic examination of the colon revealed adenocarcinoma in the sigmoid colon.

"In 1998, a 20-year-old male was admitted to the General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University (Tianjin, China) with symptoms of dizziness, unsteadiness and nausea for three weeks, as well as vomiting for one week. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a mass in the cerebellar vermis and surgery was performed to excise the tumor. The pathological examination identified a hemangioblastoma. Three years later, the patient was readmitted to hospital due to dizziness lasting for one week. An MRI examination showed recurrence of the hemangioblastoma in the cerebellum and the patient underwent surgery to resect the tumor. In April 2012, the patient was readmitted to hospital for the third time due to jaundice. An enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed multiple RCCs in the kidneys, and a nodule with a rich blood supply in the pancreatic head. In addition, numerous cysts were identified throughout the pancreas (). These observations were confirmed by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, which revealed that the nodule in the pancreatic head was ~2.9×2.2 cm in size and possibly a NET. Due to the size and location of the tumor, the bile duct in the pancreas was compressed and the upper parts of the common bile and hepatic ducts were dilated. Since it was not possible to excise the RCCs, the patient also refused surgery to resect the pancreatic head mass. A metallic stent was placed at the stenosis site of the common bile duct, which alleviated the jaundice ( and ). Nine months later, the patient returned to the hospital with a fever, abdominal pain and jaundice. An enhanced abdominal CT was performed, which revealed no change in the size of the pancreatic head mass. The patient’s symptoms were relieved following anti-inflammatory therapy for one week. However, the patient continued to suffer the same symptoms every two months, and gradually, anti-inflammatory therapy failed to alleviate the symptoms. Radiography tests revealed complete blockage of the stent and thus, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTCD) surgery was performed.
Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood leukocytes and polymerase chain reaction was performed. Direct sequencing revealed a known mutation of a base pair change at nucleotide 473 in exon 3 (T473T/C) of the VHL gene, resulting in the amino acid change Leu158Pro.
There was a recorded family history of VHL disease, with the patient’s mother, grandmother, two uncles and three aunts also suffering from the disease. Additionally, one uncle had succumbed to RCC and five other individuals in the family had succumbed to cerebral hemangioblastomas.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 43-year-old woman presented with post-Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccination keloid scars on both shoulders. A protruding lesion had developed at the center of the keloid scar on her right shoulder 3 months prior. The lesion had increased in size, and she had squeezed out the lesion's contents several times. However, the lesion had become swollen again and was painful. When she visited our clinic, the lesion had already ruptured, and inflammation had spread to the surrounding keloid scar tissue. The keloid scar on the patient's right shoulder measured about 9 × 7 cm, and the ruptured lesion measured 2 × 1.5 cm (Fig. A). We excised all the keloid tissue including the ruptured lesion, and repaired the wound using subdermal 3-0 PDS (Ethicon, Inc., Somerville, NJ) and interrupted 5-0 Ethilone (Ethicon, Inc.) sutures, primarily (Fig. B–D). Histopathologically, a large laminated keratin-filled cyst was present in the dermis surrounded with a dense collagenous keloid scar (Fig. E). The cyst wall consisted of stratified squamous epithelium with a granular layer, which was consistent with an EC. The adjacent dermis contained characteristic broad, eosinophilic, and homogeneous keloidal collagen bundles (Fig. F). There were no postoperative complications, such as an infection or wound dehiscence. The stitches were removed 14 days postoperatively, and Steri-Strip skin closures were applied for 1 month to prevent wound dehiscence and scar widening. Subsequently, the patient used Mepiform and applied a personalized compression garment for 5 months (Fig. G and H). There were no EC recurrences or keloid overgrowth during the 1-year follow-up period, and the patient was satisfied with the final outcome.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 15-year-old East African boy was referred to our hospital with a diagnosis of recurrent TB. Upon review, the patient was found to have a history of productive cough and intermittent low-grade evening fevers for one year and shortness of breath for one week prior to presentation. One year and five months prior to his presentation to our hospital, he had presented to a peripheral hospital with similar symptoms and had been diagnosed with sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and smear-positive TB. He had been treated with anti-TB medications, which brought him only mild relief. Two months after completing anti-TB therapy, his cough and fevers worsened, for which a re-treatment regimen of anti-TB medications, including two months of intramuscular streptomycin, were started on the basis of clinical findings. The sputum examination for AFB had not been repeated. Four months into the course of his second course of anti-TB therapy, the patient stopped taking his medications because he reportedly experienced only mild relief of his symptoms. Repeat Ziehl-Neelsen staining performed two months prior to his admission to our institution was negative for AFB, and no more drugs were given. One week prior to his admission to our hospital, the patient developed progressively worsening shortness of breath, which was even worse while he was lying flat and was associated with dull left-sided chest pain.
His social history was significant for crushing stones (rock cutting) for two years, but he had no history of smoking or working in the mining industry. He had no history of TB or other lung disease in his family.
His physical examination revealed that he was fully conscious, afebrile, slightly wasted, and dyspneic. His oxygen saturation level was 96% on room air, and his other vital signs were normal. His respiratory examination revealed a respiratory rate of 25 cycles/minute and chest bulging on his left side, but his trachea was centrally located. Other findings on the left side included decreased chest expansion, increased tactile vocal fremitus, dull percussion note, and bronchial breath sounds. The rest of the respiratory examination was unremarkable.
The patient was admitted to the medical ward with a diagnosis of recurrent TB with massive left-sided consolidation. A complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 8.7 cells/mm3 with a differential of 69% neutrophils, 23% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, and 1% eosinophils. His hemoglobin level was 10.6 g/dL, and his platelet count was 504 cells/mm3. His erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 20 mm/hour. His renal and liver function tests were within normal ranges. A rapid test for HIV was performed and was negative. Sputum tests for Gram staining and Ziehl-Neelsen staining were both negative. A chest radiograph revealed features of huge left-sided consolidation with complete opacification of the left hemithorax (Figure ). His chest ultrasound revealed that the left lung was completely consolidated. There was no pleural or pericardial effusion, and his right lung was completely normal. Following these examinations, the patient was empirically re-started on the retreatment regimen for recurrent TB, and the cardiothoracic surgery team was consulted about performing a lung biopsy. The cardiothoracic surgery team felt that the patient was too unstable for surgery and requested that medical management be continued until the patient's condition improved.
On hospital day 3, the patient's condition started deteriorating, with worsening shortness of breath, wheezing, and hypoxia (oxygen saturation 82% to 90% on room air). He was admitted to the intensive care unit, where his anti-TB medications were continued, together with oxygen therapy. On hospital day 7, the patient died before any further intervention could be performed.
A post-mortem examination was performed by the hospital's pathologists. As shown in Figures and , the histopathologic examination revealed a huge mass in the left lung with necrosis and suppurative caseation. Microscopic examination of caseous material was negative for AFB. PAS staining was positive and cytological examination revealed yeast cells and capsules of non-viable fungi, suggestive of H. capsulatum. Because of resource limitations at our hospital, no further tests could be performed. The pathologist's impression was that the patient had had pulmonary histoplasmosis.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"Case 1: an 83-year-old man was admitted to the ICU in order to manage postoperative respiratory failure with AKI. He had previously undergone resection of rectal cancer and ileal conduit replacement. Clinical data from his ICU stay are shown in Table (case 1). On his 1st day in the ICU, Escherichia coli (E. coli) was isolated by urine culture and normal florae were isolated by oral culture (Table (case 1)). PSP measured on the 2nd day was 2,745 without PCT or CRP elevation. However, on the 6th day, severe sepsis set in and E. coli was isolated by blood culture. PSP was elevated to 3,977, and PCT and CRP had also increased. The patient’s kidney function recovered gradually with continuous hemodiafiltration; however, PSP rose to 6,051 on the 9th day, along with high SIRS and APACHE II values. The patient did not survive on the 13th day due to multiple organ failure.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 3-yr-old boy presented with abdominal pain was referred to our institution for the evaluation of a progressive bulge in his right abdomen that his mother had first noticed seven days previous on February 12, 2009. A biochemical evaluation revealed no significant abnormalities. Serum levels of tumoral markers (AFP, CA19-9, CA125 and CEA) were within reference limits. A physical exam revealed a mildly tender mass in the right hypochondrium extending to the epigastrium; however, two lesions were found after a dynamic computed tomography (). The primary lesion (8.5 × 4.3 cm) was located in the head of the pancreas and partly herniated into the abdominal wall. While the secondary lesion (1.8 × 2.1 cm) was in the left abdomen near the spleen and the tail of pancreas, and well demarcated from the surrounding structures, and no calcifications were evident within them (). They all showed well-defined margins and inhomogeneous attenuation due to the presence of cystic and solid areas, in the venous phase () and the delayed phase (), a continuous enhancement was observed with a parenchyma density that was higher than that of the arterial phase. In addition, a large and distorted vascular shadow () inside of the tumors in the arterial phase in the primary lesion. There was no radiological evidence of nodal or distant metastases; however, there was a local infiltration of the adjacent abdominal muscle that required a laparotomy.
Surgery revealed the primary lesion was firmly adhered to the adjacent omental and abdominal muscle; in addition, a local infiltration of the liver and stomach were also noted. The head of the pancreas was compressed and could be separated from the tumor due to well-defined margins. The bile duct, portal vein, and the inferior vena cava were also compressed but patent. The gross specimen showed a resected mass measuring 8 × 4 × 4 cm that was well circumscribed and solid with areas of necrosis and hemorrhaging. No calcifications were evident within the mass. The secondary lesion was also adhered to the adjacent omentum and spleen; however, it was well demarcated from the surrounding structures with no evidence of originating from the pancreas. A histopathological analysis revealed a resected mass measuring 3 × 4 × 3 cm, which was well encapsulated by omentum with no calcifications within the mass. The surgical resection was difficult due to the extensive nature of the tumor, but the two lesions were completely resected without the pancreas being damaged. In the final pathology report following surgery, the diagnosis of pancreatoblastoma was confirmed with histopathological results, and the secondary lesion histology and immunohistochemistry was consistent with the findings of the primary lesion ().
After surgery, the patient was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and epirubicin) regularly. At the time of this report, 18 months after complete tumor resection, the patient is currently in good condition and without radiological evidence of recurrent tumor or metastases () with normal levels of CA 125, CA 19-9 and AFP to date.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"The patient is a 75-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history of major depressive disorder who presented to the emergency department for altered mental status. She was brought in by ambulance after the patient developed acute aphasia and was unresponsive to verbal commands. She had developed generalized weakness, decreased oral intake, and recurrent falls over the past several weeks. Over the previous year, she had been increasingly developing abnormal dietary habits, including obsessively eating canned peaches, dairy products such as milk and cheese, and refusing to eat any leafy green vegetables. However, her mentation remained sharp, as she was able to have meaningful and in-depth conversations, up to until her recent symptoms had developed. Her initial vital signs indicated a temperature of 86.7 degrees Fahrenheit via rectal thermometer, hypertensive at 154/60 mmHg, bradycardic at 48 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/minute, and saturating 99% on room air. On physical exam, she was responsive only to painful stimulation, with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 8. However, she was able to spontaneously move all of her extremities and intermittently opened her eyes. Initial laboratory values were significant for hyponatremia of 120 mmol/L (reference range 135 - 145 mmol/L), glucose of 69 mg/dL (reference range of 74 - 106 mg/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count of 1.22 1000/uL (reference range of 4.50 - 10.50 1000/uL), ammonia was within normal limits as was the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (Table ).
Initial CT scan of the head revealed a questionable hypodensity in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) distribution in the temporal region. She was started on a forced-air warming blanket and admitted to the intensive care unit for concern for a cerebral vascular accident and hypothermia. Subsequent MRI of the brain revealed no acute intracranial findings, including no acute infarct. Mild fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintense foci within the supratentorial white matter was noted. Electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed continuous generalized slowing that was suggestive of moderate encephalopathy (Figure ).
Lumbar puncture revealed a mildly elevated cerebrospinal fluid total protein of 53 mg/dL (reference range of 15-45 mg/dL) and glucose of 71 mg/dL (reference range of 40-70 mg/dL). Her hypothermia resolved and she was transferred to the general medicine wards, however, her mentation did not improve. She remained unresponsive to verbal commands, responded only to painful stimuli, and appeared to develop nuchal rigidity, with a flat affect. Lorazepam was administered to treat for possible catatonia, however, her symptoms did not improve. Given her previous history of malnutrition, she was administered intravenous high-dose thiamine (Vitamin B₁). The following day, the patient’s mentation had improved significantly. She was able to answer questions and hold conversations. She still had partial confusion, but was alert and oriented to person and time. Her family confirmed that her improvement was closer to how she was behaving prior to admission. Subsequently, she suffered a series of mechanical falls as a consequence of persistent gait ataxia. Following her falls, her level of alertness and speed of cognition continued to improve. As her cognition returned she began to question the daily plans told to her by her physicians, physical therapists, and even her family. While some of what she said included confabulation, she rapidly became more oriented to the events around her. By the time she was deemed stable for discharge, she was able to clearly explain why she was in the hospital, as well as her post-discharge plan, but she was not able to recall events that took place during the three weeks leading up to her admission. Afterward, she was discharged home.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 64-year-old man was referred to our hospital with bulging of the sternal manubrium. He was otherwise asymptomatic. There was no antecedent history of Gardner syndrome, trauma or surgery. Physical examination revealed a firm, 3× 3 cm palpable sternal mass. The contrasted computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed a 4× 4 cm mass based on the sternal manubrium, with no apparent involvement of the mediastinal structures (Figure A and B). 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) revealed metabolically active areas around the manubrium, both sternoclavicular joints, and bilateral first sternocostal joints, which was suggestive of malignant tumor of the sternal manubrium. The patient refused to undergo preoperative fine-needle aspiration of the lesion. Thus the patient underwent a radical en bloc resection of the tumor and sternal reconstruction with autogenous rib grafts. At surgery, an expansile lesion involving the entire manubrium, both sternoclavicular joints, and bilateral first sternocostal joints was found. En bloc radical manubriectomy was performed including portions of the bilateral clavicles and first ribs. The specimen was removed 4 cm beyond the margin of the lesion. Then through a left anterior lateral incision, about 10 cm of the left fifth rib was harvested from the subperiosteum and carved into two parts with preservation of intact periosteum and pleura. Slots were cut into the ends of the two rib clips, bilateral clavicles, and the edge of the sternum using an electric drill. The two rib grafts were placed to form a T shape between the edges of the residual sternum and bilateral clavicles using rib nails, and then fixed with stainless steel wires. Histopathological examination revealed long fascicles of spindle-shaped cells with slight atypia arranged in a collagenous stroma, indicating a diagnosis of desmoid tumor (Figure A and B). The resection margins did not show any signs of neoplastic infiltration. Postoperative recovery was unremarkable and there were no complications. Three months postoperatively, computed tomography scan of the reconstructed chest showed neither instability of the chest wall nor evidence of tumor recurrence (Figure C). The patient has been free of disease for 46 months after surgery without any other treatment.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 60-year-old male experienced dimmed vision in his left eye for 3 days prior to his first visit. The patient negated any other symptoms, including pain and diplopia. He had a history of two previous occurrences of possible ON – 30 years ago in his left eye and some 10 years later in his right eye. The patient had a history of hypertension and was currently on antihypertensive drugs. No relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) was present at his first examination. BCVA was 0.65 in the right eye and 0.5 in his left eye. A fundus examination revealed an atrophic and excavated disc in his right eye. An optic disc edema was present in his left eye. Retina was normal in both eyes. Laboratory tests for sarcoidosis, syphilis, and giant cell arteritis were analyzed, including determination of HGB, blood count, serum calcium, ESR, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), and Wassermann reaction (WR). All tests were normal or negative. Visual field and color vision were analyzed 3 days later; visual field test showed arcuate inferior defects in both eyes, with equivalent neural capacity of 67% in his right eye and 58% in his left eye. A Sahlgren’s saturation test (SST) color vision test revealed a more defective color vision in his left (20) than in his right (15) eye.
An orbital MRI carried out 1 week later revealed increased signal intensity in the parts of the left optical nerve sheath, possibly indicating OPN. The MRI also showed increased signaling in the retrobulbar fat of the left eye. No increased swelling of the extraocular muscles was evident.
The patient received a course of prednisone, 60 mg/day, which was tapered over 1 month, at which time he was examined again. BCVA was 1.0 in the right eye and 0.65 in his left eye. The optic disc edema had subsided substantially since the last fundus examination 1 month earlier. He received a new course of prednisone, starting with 25 mg/day, which was tapered to 7.5 mg/day until his next visit 2 months later. His BCVA was 1.0 in his right eye and 0.65 in his left eye.
Visual field testing again showed arcuate inferior defects in both eyes and abnormal thresholds, with equivalent neural capacity of 69% in his right eye and 61% in his left eye. A new MRI showed a slight regression of the enhancement around the left optical nerve since the last MRI. The results of a fundus examination revealed a pale papilla in both eyes. He remained on 7.5 mg/day prednisone, which was tapered over 14 weeks. At a new consultation 4 months later, BCVA was 1.0 in the right eye and 0.5 in his left eye.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 55-year-old man presented with fever and abdominal pain. Abdominal CT showed swelling of the right kidney and low attenuation areas (Figure ). Laboratory tests and renal CT imaging were suggestive of pyelonephritis. However, multiple cavitary lesions were also found on the routine chest radiography performed on admission. VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery) lung biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma presumably from the kidney. Therefore, a renal tumor with multiple pulmonary metastases, was considered. At the time, transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) was suspected, which later proved to be a misdiagnosis, and chemotherapy with MVAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin, and cisplatin) was given. However, the chemotherapy was not effective, and the patient died of respiratory failure 2 months later. On autopsy, the primary tumor was found to be a collecting duct carcinoma, and there were lung, liver, spleen, bone marrow, right adrenal gland, and para-aortic lymph node metastases. CT done while the patient was alive detected lung (Figure ), liver (Figure ), and para-aortic lymph node (Figure ) metastases.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 54-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for occipital soft tissue swelling and headache. The patient’s history was remarkable for resection and radiation therapy for a hemangiopericytoma (HPC) in the left gluteal musculature 10 years previously. The patient had also undergone multiple pulmonary metastases resections. An ultrasound of the occipital region revealed a heterogeneous soft tissue mass with destruction of the occipital bone of up to 6 cm (Figure ). Computed tomography (CT) of the brain showed an extra-axial mass in the fossa posterior extending through the tentorium and lysis of the overlying occipital bone (Figure ). On MRI the mass was isointense to grey matter on both T1- and T2-weighted images (WI), flow voids were noted (Figure , arrowheads). The lesion demonstrated mildly heterogenous, avid contrast enhancement (Figure ). There was no restricted diffusion.

"A 46-year-old male with a history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis complicated by small esophageal varices after banding and moderate ascites was awaiting liver transplant (MELD 24, Child-Pugh class B). He presented with a 3-day history of abdominal pain. He described the pain as sharp and located around the periumbilical area with notable suprapubic discomfort. He also reported associated symptoms of nausea, hematochezia, and general malaise. On further review of systems, he reported chills, increased fatigue, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and decreased appetite 4 days prior to presentation. He reported compliance at home with a sodium-restricted diet and medications. Physical exam was significant for abdominal distension with positive fluid wave, generalized abdominal tenderness, and splenomegaly. Scant blood was noted on the rectal exam. Laboratory studies revealed stable hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL, hematocrit of 36.8%, platelet of 83 K/UL, leukocytosis of 15.4 K/UL with 78% neutrophils and 16% bands, sodium of 130 mmol/L, ammonia of 83 Umol/L, ALT of 40 U/L, AST of 42 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase of 127 U/L. International normalized ratio (INR) was 2.02. Diagnostic paracentesis revealed serosanguinous fluid and ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) count of 686 cells/mm3, consistent with culture negative neutrocytic ascites. Blood cultures revealed no growth of organisms. The patient was started on intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone, IV pantoprazole infusion, and an IV bolus of octreotide followed by continuous infusion. He completed a 5-day course of IV ceftriaxone therapy.
The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which showed ulcerations in the distal esophagus from prior banding of small esophageal varices and diffuse portal hypertensive gastropathy (). Mucosal edema and erythema with an area of oozing of blood were identified in the duodenum bulb and between proximally located duodenal folds with no specific identifiable lesion. These findings correlated with a diagnosis of portal hypertensive duodenopathy (). Colonoscopy was performed, and it showed no active bleeding. However, there were old blood clots in the terminal ileum in addition to mild inflammation in the terminal ileum near the ileocecal valve. Video capsule endoscopy was also performed, and it revealed no active bleeding. Because of the concern of the possible failure of the patient on medical therapy for portal hypertension while awaiting liver transplant, the patient was referred for evaluation by a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). The patient successfully underwent the TIPS procedure. Follow-up occurred one month later in clinic. At this time, the patient reported resolution of the hematochezia.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 65-year-old woman with a history of hyperlipidemia had experienced headache and vomiting for 10 days before admission to another hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed enlargement of both lateral ventricles and a mass at the foramen of Monro. The patient was then referred to our hospital.
Neurological examination on admission to our hospital showed memory disturbance (Mini-Mental State Examination 20/30) and a wide-based gait disturbance. Computed tomography (CT) showed a 16 mm mildly hyperdense mass with no calcification at the foramen of Monro, and the mass was causing obstructive hydrocephalus. MRI revealed a well-delineated mass at the foramen of Monro with heterogeneous signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images; the mixed-signal core appeared as a popcorn-like lesion typical of cavernous angioma (Fig. ). Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted imaging revealed mild enhancement of the mass (Fig. ). There were no vascular abnormalities on CT angiography or CT venography. We considered a colloid cyst, central neurocytoma, subependymoma, ependymoma, low grade astrocytoma, and arteriovenous malformation as differential diagnosis; however, despite the unusual location of the mass, a diagnosis of intraventricular cavernous angioma was made because of its typical appearance on MRI.
We performed endoscope-assisted transcortical removal of the mass (Fig. ). The entry point was made using the StealthStation S7 navigation system (Medtronic Inc., Louisville, CO), and a flexible videoscope (VEF-V, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted. Intraoperative neuroendoscopic imaging revealed a reddish lobular mass with a hematoma and obstruction of the foramen of Monro. We observed the cavum septum pellucidum because of the high intracranial pressure associated with hydrocephalus. After right frontal mini-craniotomy, the Viewsite Brain Access System (Vycor Medical Inc., Boca Raton, FL) was inserted (Raza et al. ); we used the 17 mm wide retractor in the 7 cm length. Endoscope-assisted surgery with the Viewsite was performed with technique similar to microsurgery. A 2.7 mm rigid endoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) fixed by UniArm (Mitaka Kohki, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted. The working ambience was air because of its advantages over fluid ambience especially when dealing with a relatively vascularized pathology. Other microsurgical instruments were used parallel to the endoscope. The endoscope served only as an optic apparatus. We used the Viewsite as an access port to enable dual instrumentation (endoscope and microsurgical instrumentation). The tumor was bluntly dissected from the ventricle wall, and total en bloc resection of the lesion was performed by one surgeon using the two-handed technique. Bleeding was well controlled with irrigation and bipolar coagulation.
The resected tumor was reddish and consisted mainly of clotted blood vessels and xanthochromic tissue. Histological examination revealed a cavernous angioma with evidence of large vascular spaces filled with an organized thrombus (Fig. ).
Postoperative MRI confirmed complete removal of the tumor, and a return to normal ventricular size (Fig. ). The patient’s symptoms resolved immediately, and there were no postoperative complications. She was discharged without any neurological deficit. No complications or neurological impairment were observed at the 1-year follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A previously healthy 25-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital with complaints of chest pain. His history was unremarkable. Physical examination did not reveal any significant findings. A CT scan revealed a 7.6 × 6.5 × 3.5 cm mass in the anterior mediastinum and no metastases at the initial diagnosis. His laboratory values included an AFP level of 3,034 ng/mL and an hCG level of 20.6 ng/mL. Ultrasonography of the testes revealed a uniform pattern without any findings suggestive of malignancy. Needle core biopsy was not performed. Based on suspicion for PMGCT, the patient was referred for thoracic surgery. The tumor was histopathologically diagnosed as a yolk sac tumor. After the operation, the patient received 4 total courses of BEP and EP chemotherapy. Upon completion of the chemotherapy, his serum tumor marker levels normalized ().

"A 45-year-old male underwent a left upper lobectomy and postoperative pathology revealed invasive stage IIIA lung adenocarcinoma (). Targeted next- generation sequencing (NGS) with a customized panel (Geneseeq Prime panel) designed to target 425 cancer-specific genes was performed, and four somatic mutations and copy number alterations (CNAs) were identified, including EGFR-KDD of exon 18-25 [mutant allele frequency (MAF): 13.5%], EGFR amplification (4.5-fold), TP53 p.Y220C (MAF: 37.0%), and RB1 single copy loss (). The tumor mutation burden (TMB) was estimated to be 1.1 mutation/Mb. The patient received pemetrexed and cisplatin as adjuvant chemotherapy. Four months later, he progressed with liver metastasis in left lobe ().
Then, the patient was treated with Icotinib and the metastasis shrunk. Unfortunately, the drug resistance was observed only after 4 months, as evidenced by the fact that previously responsive liver lesion progressed. Left hepatic re-biopsy confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma and target sequencing (Geneseeq Prime panel) detected the same EGFR-KDD (MAF: 4.9%) as well as mutation of TP53 p.Y220C (MAF: 0.5%) (). The TMB was calculated as 2.2 mutation/Mb.
Docetaxel and cisplatin were initiated as the second-line therapy. However, the left hepatic metastasis enlarged rapidly after 2 cycles of chemotherapy. The blood carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level increased from 9.5 mg/ml (before chemotherapy) to 22.7 mg/ml. Even worse, a right hepatic metastasis appeared soon afterward. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of liver was conducted on both of the left and right hepatic metastases, but no reduction in liver lesions was observed, and the CEA level showed a slight increase from 7.3 to 10.3 mg/ml.
Afterward, the patient started taking Osimertinib (80 mg once daily). Encouragingly, both liver lesions showed significant regression (). One month after initiation of Osimertinib, the CEA level decreased to 5.4 mg/ml, and remained at normal level for 18 months. Moreover, the progression-free survival (PFS) reached 21 months. However, the CEA level increased to 23.1 mg/ml at the 19th month after the initiation of Osimertinib treatment, and 2 months later, the patient progressed with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes () with the CEA level of 73.9 mg/ml. Resampling and targeted sequencing (Geneseeq Prime panel) consistently identified EGFR-KDD (MAF: 33.9%), as well as EGFR amplification (6.6-fold), TP53 p.Y220C (MAF: 53.3%), and a new mutation of RELN p.G1774E (MAF: 45.4%) (). The estimated TMB increased to 3.4 mutation/Mb. In addition, the assessment of PD-L1 expression using antibody 28-8 (pharm Dx, Dako’s Platform) showed tumor proportion score (TPS) of 1%.
On these bases, the fourth-line salvage therapy using Nivolumab was prescribed and the therapeutic efficacy was considerable, as evidenced by the decreased CEA, regressed mediastinal lymph nodes, reduced metastases in both left and right liver (). Specifically, the CEA level decreased from 143.6 to 41.8 mg/ml one month later. The PFS reached 7 months and no obvious adverse effects were observed. The quality of life was in good status during the Nivolumab treatment. After that, the patient progressed with enlarged liver metastasis. Unfortunately, the patient was also infected with tuberculosis, and his condition took a sharp turn for the worse due to both tumor progression and tuberculosis. The families gave up further treatment and the patient died 4 months later.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"Case 1: A 66-year-old woman presented with chronic bloody nasal discharge, sero-mucous otitis and acute arthritis of the right elbow. With the onset of episcleritis and the finding of cANCA-PR3, a diagnosis of GPA was made. The patient was treated with prednisone and cyclophosphamide, subsequently replaced by mycophenolate mofetil because of hemorrhagic cystitis. The evolution was favorable. Due to weight loss of 10 kg a thoraco-abdominal CT was performed 10 years later revealing hyperdense spontaneous thickening with enhancement around the ascending and horizontal aorta. In addition pulmonary opacity of the right lower lobe was detected and a diagnosis of mononeuropathy with falling foot was made. A PET-CT showed hypermetabolism (SUV max 8.1) at the aortic arch and the ascending aorta. cANCA-PR3 were present at all times. In this context, immunosuppression by corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil was intensified. PET-CT scanning 18 months later showed a clear decrease in hypercaptation.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 56-year-old Malay man with chronic hepatitis B, not on regular follow-up, who first presented to a private medical center with abdominal distension in July 2010, was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma and referred to our institute for further management.
At our institute, a dynamic CT scan of the liver revealed five hypervascular lesions at segments IVa, VII and VIII in the background of cirrhosis. The largest lesion at segment IVa, measured 4.3 × 3.5 cm and associated splenomegaly and esophageal varices but no ascites was observed ().
Local treatment of the multicentric HCC using RFA was planned in agreement with the patient. During the pre-procedural assessment, the patient was incidentally found to have a small ventricular septal defect with left to right shunting. However, the chamber sizes and left ventricular ejection fraction were normal.
At the time of treatment, he had Child Class A compensated liver disease with the following laboratory test results: serum albumin, 32 g/L; serum bilirubin, 21 µmol/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 45 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 54 IU/L; platelet count, 61 × 109/L; International Normalised Ratio, 1.2; and alpha fetoprotein (AFP), 23.8 ng/mL.
The procedure was performed under general anesthesia and fluoroscopic CT guidance (Somatom Definition AS, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) using a 10 cm long expandable 15 G StarBurst XL radiofrequency (RF) needle (RITA Medical System, Mountain View, CA, USA) with an array diameter of 5 cm. The RF current generator used was the 1500X RF generator system (RITA Medical System, Mountain View, CA, USA). Four grounding pads were placed on the patient's thighs. The patient's pulse-oximetry, arterial blood pressure, and cardiac activity were monitored during the entire procedure. Under CT fluoroscopic guidance, the largest tumour in segment IVa was identified. The needle tip was placed such that the thines at 2 cm deployment covered the outer margins of the tumour. Deployment was monitored under CT fluoroscopic guidance. This lesion was ablated to 5 cm after which the needle was repositioned twice to ablate the medial and lateral margins to provide a 5 mm margin around the tumour. The entire process was constantly monitored using CT fluoroscopy. The area of coagulation necrosis was seen within the tumour () with no evidence of any pericardial fluid. During the attempt to remove the RF needle from segment IVa, the thines would not retract. Significant force was finally used to retract the thines.
The operator then decided to ablate the lesion in segment VI. During placement of the needle, it was noted that there was an expanding pericardial effusion (). The procedure was aborted to facilitate the management of the cardiac tamponade. Immediate pericardiocentesis performed by a cardiologist, was noted to be haemorrhagic. Approximately 300 mL of blood was aspirated but the patient was persistently hypotensive and an emergency sternostomy was performed. Intra-operatively, two litres of blood was evacuated from the pericardium. A puncture wound was noted at the anterior cardiac vein (right marginal vein) (), which could have led to the haemorrhagic cardiac tamponade. In addition, inflammatory changes are also seen in the adjacent diaphragm but no evidence of any ablation change was seen in the pericardium. The anterior cardiac vein (right marginal vein) was repaired and haemostasis was secured.
The patient was stable post-surgery. While in the intensive care unit, his condition gradually deteriorated with the development of liver failure, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, and sepsis. The patient expired 19 days after the primary event.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 39-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of skin lesions involving the face, neck and extremities. The patient was diagnosed as being HIV-positive a month earlier and was commenced on antiretroviral treatment abacavir 300 mg bd, lamivudine 300 mg bd and efavirenz 600 mg once daily, because of impaired renal function or pre-renal failure. The patient was hydrated with an improvement in the renal function. Two weeks after the development of the skin lesions, the patient complained of a sore throat and hoarseness of his voice.
On clinical examination, the patient had multiple translucent, clustered, umbilicated papules and nodules in the centrofacial region and neck with necrotic centres. In addition, there were verrucous plaques and nodules on the ears and upper limbs ( and ). Chest X-ray was normal with no lung, hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes. A fibre-optic laryngoscopy revealed a supraglottitis with ulceration on the lingual surface of the epiglottis ().
Routine blood investigations demonstrated elevation of the liver enzymes with an infiltrative pattern (AST-63/ALT 70/ALP -219/Gamma GT-291). Abdominal ultrasound revealed an enlarged liver with abnormal parenchyma. The kidneys and the rest of the abdomen were normal. The initial CD4 count performed prior to the commencement of antiretrovirals was 2 cells/µL with a viral load greater than one million copies/mL. A repeat test (eight weeks later) showed a CD4 count of 124 cells/µL with a viral load of less than 20 copies/mL. Urinalysis and urine histoplasma antigen test were negative. Histology of the liver, larynx and sections of the skin demonstrated pandermal necrotising granulomatous inflammation. Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver and PAS stains revealed a relative paucity of intracellular oval, narrow-neck budding fungal organisms morphologically in keeping with Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum ( and ). Fungal culture of liver, epiglottis ulcer and skin confirmed the diagnosis of histoplasmosis.
On the basis of the clinical presentation, initial worsening of the disease and rapid elevation of the CD4+ T-cell count with lowering of the HIV viral load, the patient most likely has histoplasmosis associated IRIS. The patient was commenced on intravenous amphotericin B (0.8 mg/kg/day) for two weeks and continued with his antiretroviral treatment. He had an excellent response to this treatment and was discharged on itraconazole 100 mg twice a day.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 62-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of mental abnormality and hypomnesia for 3 months. The main mental symptoms were gibberish, irrational talk, impaired mental attention, without apparent hallucinations and delusions. The patient did not present with fluctuating consciousness, lack of consciousness, or loss of consciousness. The family of the patient reported that she had a history of fever before she experienced the mental symptoms. Her highest body temperature was 38.6 °C. Her axillary temperature became normal after she received antibiotic therapy for 4 days. However, she gradually developed symptoms of mental abnormality. She also intermittently complained of abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, and urinary incontinence for 1 month. She did not experience other discomforts, such as headaches, dizziness, and convulsion. She visited a local hospital in October 2018, and the routine blood test showed that the white blood cell counts were normal, and the percentage of lymphocytes was high. The blood potassium was 1.91 mmol/l (normal 3.5-5.3 mmol/l), and the prolactin level was 90.55 μg/l (normal 2.74–26.72 μg/l). The free thyroxine was slightly high, the thyroglobulin antibody was 12.32 IU/ml (normal 0–115 IU/ml), and the thyroid peroxidase antibody was 10.42 IU/ml (normal 0–34 IU/ml). The testing results of antinuclear antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anti-Jo-1 antibody, anti-dsDNA antibody, anti-Scl-70 antibody, anti-SSA antibody, and anti-SSB antibody were yielded negative, and the tests for hepatitis, HIV, and syphilis virus were also negative. The local hospital suspected intracranial infection, endocrine disease, and electrolyte disorders and gave her symptomatic treatment. Nevertheless, her symptoms showed no noticeable improvement. It was difficult to diagnose the disease, so the patient was admitted to our hospital. The patient had a history of diabetes, hypertension, erosive gastritis, and cataract surgery, but she had no family history of neurological diseases.
The physical examination revealed that her body temperature was 36.8 °C, and there was tenderness below the xiphoid. The neurological examination showed impaired mental attention and reaction capacity, slow speech, normal manifestations of the brain nerve, normal muscle strength, and muscle tone, negative meningeal irritation sign and pathological reflex, normal tendon reflex. The patient could not cooperate with the sensory system examination. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score was only 6/30.
Encephalitis was initially suspected, and lumbar puncture was performed. The CSF examination showed that the CSF pressure was 110 mmH2O, and the white blood cell count was normal, but she had an increased total protein level of 0.57 g/l (normal 0.15–0.45 g/l) and a glucose level of 5.10 mmol/l (normal 2.2–3.9 mmol/l). The coxsackie B virus, enterovirus, and cytomegalovirus test levels were normal. Bacterial culture and Cryptococcus neoformans tests were negative. A contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain was normal. The diagnosis of encephalitis was excluded in general. However, leukoencephalopathy was evident on the T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. A high-signal intensity in the white matter of the cerebral hemisphere, especially at the subcortex of the frontotemporal and corona radiata, was found on the T2 FLAIR images (Fig. a-c). The MRI imaging of the left basal ganglia and bilateral corona radiata showed lacunar infarction. Magnetic resonance angiography indicated that the blood vessels were normal. The DWI results revealed a symmetrically distributed strip-shaped high-intensity signal of the corticomedullary junction in the bilateral frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes (Fig. d-f).
Skin biopsy samples were obtained at 10 cm above the patient’s ankle. A light microscope was used to examine the samples, which showed hyperkeratosis of the epidermis. A few lymphocytes and tissue cells infiltrated through the superficial vessels of the dermis (Fig. a). Electron microscopy showed round-shaped intranuclear inclusions in the nucleus of the fibrocytes. The intranuclear inclusions had clear borders and were composed of fibrous substances without a membrane structure (Fig. b and c).
The fasting blood glucose was 9.48 mmol/l, and glycosylated hemoglobin was 6.6%. The routine urine test showed normal results. The patient presented with mental abnormality for 3 months. We did not consider the diagnoses of hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome. Furthermore, the patient did not present with depression, anxiety, consciousness disorders, hallucinations, and neurasthenia, which were common mental symptoms in patients with diabetes. The results of the electrolyte showed hypokalemia (2.6 mmol/L), hyponatremia (127.3 mmol/L), and hypochloremia (86.5 mmol/L). The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and cortisol hormone tests showed normal results. The MRI of the hypophysis showed no abnormal areas. The electroencephalography showed low-and moderate-amplitude desynchronized-mixed waves when she fell asleep.
Brain protection and symptomatic therapy were given when the patient was hospitalized, and the symptoms were relieved. However, she still complained of recurrent vomiting and urinary incontinence. The patient was alive, and the condition of the patient did not worsen or improve for 6 months after she was discharged.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 51-year-old man suffered from progressive dysphagia to solids for over about 6 months and slow weight loss of 5 kg was referred to our institution with the presumptive diagnosis of achalasia. Preoperative workup consisted in a careful clinical history, correct interpretation of anamnesis, and symptoms; then esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and showed a dilated esophagus without evident mucosal lesion, and the passage through the cardia was more difficult: “crossing snap” passage. Manometry revealed absence of peristalsis and impaired swallow-induced LES relaxation with classic manometric pattern (). The barium swallow showed an emptying defect with “bird beak” sign and narrowing at esophageal junction (). We made a diagnosis of esophageal achalasia and performed a laparoscopic Heller's myotomy with Dor fundoplication (Figures and ). We use the laparoscopic approach to perform this kind of surgery. Several studies demonstrate that this is the best way to treat this pathology. We use Veres' needle placed in Palmer's point to create pneumoperitoneum and then we place five trocars: the first 10–12 mm trocar is placed in supraumbilical region, two 10–12 mm trocars in right and left side, and two 5 mm trocars in paraxiphoid region and left iliac region []. The surgical exploration of peritoneal cavity does not reveal any anatomic abnormality or suspect neoplastic lesions or secondary localizations. Two months after surgery, the patient complained of worsening dysphagia. We repeated several esophagogastroduodenoscopies with numerous biopsies that showed only cardia inflammation and were negative for malignancy. Tumor markers were negative too. Balloon dilatation was performed to improve symptoms. Persisting dysphagia, one month after we performed EUS with biopsies, showed infiltrating gastric adenocarcinoma of the cardia (T3 WHO, Siewert II) (). After staging CT scan, total gastroesophagectomy was performed, with D2 lymph-node resection and Roux-en-Y reconstruction. The surgical specimen contained a thick, hard tumor 3,6 × 2,5 × 1,3 cms located in the gastroesophageal junction (Siewert II), extensively infiltrating the wall and reaching in some areas the subserosal layer (Figures and ). Histological finding was “poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (WHO: G3)” (Figures and ).","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, IHD, and right-sided hemiplegia presented to a urologist with recurrent episodes of retention of urine due to prostatic hyperplasia. Considering his medical co-morbidity, a prostatic stent (Urolume) was placed instead of surgery. Approximately 9 months later, he presented to us with severe dysuria, hematuria and poor stream, and urinary tract infection since the last 3 months.
On admission, his physical examination was normal except for right hemiparesis. The prostate had a benign feel on rectal examination. Urinalysis showed pyuria and microscopic hematuria. A urine culture was positive for E. coli. An ultrasonography revealed normal kidneys with approximately 75 gms of prostate. An echogenecity of the Urolume stent was visible in the bladder. Hence, removal of stent was planned.
A urethrocystoscopy showed a normal urethra with big median and lateral lobes of prostate. The Urolume stent had migrated into the bladder lying in a pool of pus flakes. We tried to remove it using alligator forceps but the stent could not be withdrawn into the sheath of cystoscope. Hence, the stent was cut into small pieces using a Holmium: YAG laser using 550 micron fiber with a power setting of 1.2 J and 20 HZ. The stent fragments were removed by withdrawing them into the sheath using grasping forceps. Subsequently, the enlarged prostate was enucleated by Holmium laser. The post-operative period was uneventful and the patient could pass urine satisfactorily after removal of the catheter on the second day after the operation.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 27-year-old African American male with a history of morbid obesity status post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 9 years prior presented with painful nonbloody mucoid diarrhea, icterus, and dark urine of four-day duration. He described recent travel with family to a beach resort in the United States during which he noted that two family members had developed a self-limited diarrheal illness. Three days after exposure, he noted abdominal cramps followed by hourly watery yellow stools without blood. He also had intermittent nausea and an episode of bilious vomiting and reports not eating since onset of diarrheal illness. He noticed a 17-pound weight loss over 1 week. He had no fevers, chills, or rash. There was no preceding history of eating uncooked fish or meats and he had no tick exposure. Medication history included Lisinopril and Amlodipine, and he denied any new medications or alcohol use. He admitted to homosexual intercourse.
He was acutely ill-looking with icteric sclera and dry mucus membranes. Vitals signs showed low-grade fever of 100.2°F and pulse rate of 126 beats per minute. Cardiac, lung, and skin examinations were unremarkable. Abdomen was diffusely tender with hyperactive bowel sounds without peritoneal signs.
Laboratory data was remarkable for leukopenia of 2200/μL, hemoglobin of 12.7 g/dL, normal platelet of 158,000/μL, sodium of 128 meq/L and potassium of 3.2 meq/L, acute kidney injury with creatinine of 1.59 mg/dL (baseline of 0.63 mg/dL), BUN of 41 mg/dL, and anion gap of 19. After intravenous hydration, hemoglobin dropped to 10.1 g/dL and platelet to 96,000/μL. Sodium, BUN, and creatinine also improved with rehydration. He was also noted to have elevated transaminases AST 201 IU/L and ALT 73 IU/L, elevated total bilirubin of 8.2 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 4.4 mg/dL, normal alkaline phosphatase of 66 IU/L, albumin of 3.2 g/dL, normal lipase of 40 U/L, and elevated lactate of 3.5 meq/L. INR was elevated to 1.8; however, he had normal haptoglobin 236 mg/dL (36–195 mg/dL) and LDH 177 IU/L (normal: 94–202 IU/L). Hepatitis panel was negative. Patient also tested negative for HIV, CMV, EBV, and Parvovirus B19 infection. Tylenol level was normal. Urinalysis showed moderate bilirubinuria. Stool study was positive for Shigella sonnei but was otherwise negative for bacteria, ova, or parasites. Rickettsia rickettsii IgM was positive and he was treated with Doxycycline. Other workup for tick-borne infection including Lyme, Babesia, Ehrlichia, and Anaplasma was negative. Autoimmune workups including ANA, antismooth muscle, liver/kidney microsome, and mitochondrial antibodies were negative. Alpha-1 antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin were also normal.
Abdominal ultrasound showed a diffusely increased heterogeneous liver echogenicity with underlying hepatomegaly consistent with hepatic steatosis. Hepatoportal duplex showed patent portal vein and hepatic artery. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis was significant for hepatic steatosis, hepatomegaly, mild right colitis, and absence of gallstones. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) was unremarkable with normal intra- and extrahepatic biliary tree.
During his hospital course, bilirubin trended up to 9 mg/dL and INR peaked at 2.9. Patient was not encephalopathic. Given impending hepatic failure, recommendation was made to transfer the patient to a transplant center but he declined. He was treated with N-acetylcysteine. Blood culture initially reported as Gram-negative rods presumptively Escherichia coli (E. coli) was later confirmed to be Shigella sonnei. Urine culture remained negative. He was treated with ciprofloxacin based on sensitivity results with an improvement in diarrhea frequency and downward trend in transaminases. He remained stable and was discharged home on Day 8. He was doing well 4 months later with normal cell counts, normal liver, and kidney function.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"The 51-year-old male patient exhibited a 10-day history of low back pain, limited waist motion and right lower limb numbness. The patient reported no pain at other sites, exhibited no fever or night sweats and was unable to recall any recent injury. The patient’s past medical history was unremarkable for trauma or other bone diseases. A physical examination demonstrated localized tenderness and percussion pain over the L4 spinous process, restricted waist motion and numbness of the right leg. Laboratory tests, including full blood cell count, serum electrolytes, renal and liver function tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), did not reveal any abnormalities. An X-ray revealed that the lesion was limited to the left lateral mass of the atlas, causing a potential instability (). Computed tomography (CT) revealed an osteolytic lesion in the right lateral mass of the L4 and accessories, accompanied by a paravertebral and intraspinal soft tissue extension (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed osteolytic destruction of the vertebral body associated with a mild compression fracture that exhibited hypointensity on T1-weighted (T1-W) images and hyperintensity on T2-weighted (T2-W) images (). On the basis of the radiological features of the lesion, there was a high possibility that the patient had a neoplastic lesion. However, the radiological features of the lesion were not sufficient to establish the diagnosis of LCH with certainty. A C-arm X-ray machine-guided needle biopsy of the vertebral body was performed and the histopathological diagnosis was LCH. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD1a and S-100 (). Further diagnostic evaluation included a bone scan, CT of the lungs, pituitary hormonal evaluation and brain CT and abdominal ultrasound evaluation. No other LCH infiltration was identified in the patient and the patient was treated as suffering from a single-system and single-site disease.
The patient underwent PVP (Stryker, Inc., Meyzieu, France) under local anesthesia in the prone position with the belly suspended in midair, under C-arm imaging guidance (). The amount of bone cement used to fill in the L4 was 3.6 ml. The blood loss during surgery was 5 ml. The spread of the cement was ideal with the exception of a small amount of paravertebral leakage of cement () which did not cause any symptoms. No complications were observed during the surgery or follow-up. After lying in bed for 6 h, the patient was able to sit freely and 24 h postoperatively, the patient was allowed to walk freely. Following the procedure, the low back pain was resolved completely and the patient’s neurological symptoms were rapidly alleviated and then gradually continued to be alleviated. The patient required the use of a weak opioid prior to the PVP but did not receive an analgesic afterwards. Notably, CT revealed a significant decrease in the paravertebral and intraspinal soft tissue extension 5 days after the PVP ().
The patient received chemotherapy following PVP. The chemotherapy regime was 100 mg etoposide (days 1–3) and 60, 40 and 20 mg prednisone (days 1–7, 8–14 and 15–21, respectively) for 3 cycles. There were no serious side-effects of the chemotherapy. CT revealed that the paravertebral and intraspinal soft tissue extension disappeared after 3 cycles (). The height of the vertebral body remained stable without further collapse and lumbar kyphosis did not occur. There was no recurrence and no other complaints over a 6-month follow-up period ().","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"Peter and his family arrived to our clinical service when he was 14 months old. Perinatal anamnesis documented full-term birth after cesarean section with adequate extra-uterus adjustment, risk for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and reduced cranial diameters and good general health conditions at discharge from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). At 1 month, the analyses confirmed the significant reduction in brain volume. A diagnostic follow-up at 5 months documented the onset of epileptic seizures. Overall, Peter appeared to be easily dysregulated by moderate-to-high intensity stimulations and poor emotional regulation were reported.
To obtain more specific and fine-grained information on Peter’s emotional regulation during a standardized observational procedure.
During the Play episode, Peter was specifically sensitive to tactile (e.g., mother caressing) and auditory (e.g., mother singing) stimulations. In response to this kind of stimulations, Peter showed positive emotionality (e.g., rhythmic movements of the chest and arms together with wide mouth opening). During the Still-Face episode, Peter immediately appeared alert and sensitive to the suspension of maternal communication by exhibiting an immediate stress response (i.e., increase of motor activity and emergence of disorganized movements of the chest and arms). Interestingly, specific patterns of dyadic matching behaviors emerged including attempts to reach out with the arms directed to the mother’s body while simultaneously seeking eye-contact with her in order to be picked up. Such relational regulatory strategies were something that Peter usually did not show when distressed, as he easily became disorganized.
During the maternal unavailability episode Peter shows a clear ability to regulate his own behavior and emotions through relational strategies, something otherwise non-observable with a different observational procedure. Although such regulatory strategies may not be usual for the infant, it is clinically relevant to highlight that in response to specific relational and environmental adjustments (i.e., face-to-face interaction, lowered stimulation, enough time to organize other-directed attempts to self-regulate) Peter can access to more adaptive strategies to achieve regulation. This knowledge enriches the picture of Peter difficulties in self-stabilization and highlights a dyadic pattern to reinforce in order to support infant’s socio-emotional regulation.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 13-year-old girl presented to the emergency room with generalized, acute abdominal pain (worst in the hypogastric region) with fever 38.9°, anorexia and vomiting started 2 days prior to presentation.
The parents mentioned that they brought her 5 months ago with mild pain and abdominal mass; an ultrasonography showed no splenic tissue in upper left quadrant, which suggested a wandering spleen and a CT scan was ordered, but the parents ignored. She did not have history of trauma or any remarkable past medical history.
On examination, the abdomen was rigid with generalized tenderness and rebound tenderness. There was an evident mass bulging under the umbilicus. Heart rate was 123 bpm with otherwise normal cardiorespiratory function.
On admission, her hemoglobin was 11.3 g/dL, white cell count 19.6 × 109/L, granulocytes 78.1% and CRP 21.6 mg/L. Her renal, liver function, amylase and lactate were within normal limits.
A Doppler ultrasonography showed that the spleen was in the hypogastric region with a diameter of 14 cm and a very low perfusion. The abdominal radiograph and the chest radiograph were normal.
She was prepared for an emergency laparotomy; the spleen was infarcted without any ligamentous attachments. The hilar vessels of the spleen were within a long mesentery. The splenic vessels were twisted three rounds around themselves. The other organs in the abdomen were normal (). A splenectomy was performed and the splenic vessels were ligated and then cut.
Her recovery was uneventful, and she took vaccines dedicated for splenectomy patients.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"On March 10, 2020, a 50-year-old man, positive for SARS-CoV-2, was admitted to Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital (Wuhan, China) after 47 days of cough and fever (). On February 15, nucleic acid results for SARS-CoV-2 were positive. Previous treatments included arbidol (0.2 g, thrice daily) and lianhua qingwen granules (6 g, thrice daily). On admission, peripheral oxygen saturation was 96% in ambient air and respiratory rate was 18 breaths/minute. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels for SARS-CoV-2 were, respectively, 53.12 g/L and 173.69 g/L (normal range for both: <10 g/L; Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China). Computed tomography (CT) findings showed a bilateral, scattered, high-density shadow and fiber- and spine-like opacities. From March 10 to 22, convalescent plasma from COVID-19 patients (200 mL, March 17 and 18), recombinant human interferon (0.3 mL, atomized inhalation, once daily), lianhua qingwen granules (6 g, thrice daily), and arbidol (2 tablets, thrice daily) were administered as treatment; on March 23, chloroquine phosphate (2 tablets, twice daily) was administered instead of arbidol. On March 23, SARS-CoV-2 RNA were positive. A CT scan showed substantial improvement, with no obvious pulmonary lesions, on March 24. He was treated with ritonavir-boosted danoprevir (DNVr) alone (100/100 mg, one tablet twice daily). From April 3 to 5, nucleic acid test results for SARS-CoV-2 were all negative. SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG levels were markedly reduced (5.38 g/L and 108.68 g/L, respectively). On April 7, he was discharged from the hospital after three consecutively negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The duration from positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA to three consecutive negative results was 55 days.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 56-year-old man with episodic transient visual loss in right eye (OD), of 2 days duration. He was not symptomatic at presentation and was using anti-coagulants for cardiovascular disease. Visual acuity was 6/6 both eyes (OU). Intra-ocular pressure and anterior segment were normal OU. OD had a finger like area of macular whitening sparing the fovea. This area corresponded to the vascular bed of a clinically appearing cilio-retinal artery (cilio-RA) []. However, on fluorescein angiography, the artery filled along with branches of central RA (CRA) [Fig. and ]. Swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) showed inner and middle retinal edema with shadowing of underlying layers []. The superficial capillary plexus was less affected on SS-OCT angiography (SS-OCTA). The deeper plexus revealed reduced capillary density nasal to the fovea, with an adjacent hypo-dense capillary nonperfusion area [Figure and ]. A diagnosis of occlusion of intra-neural branch of CRA was made.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"‘Mr. C’ is a 58-year-old Navy veteran with a history of substance use disorder in sustained remission, traumatic brain injury (TBI), mild neurocognitive impairment, and a 15-year diagnosis of schizophrenia. Importantly, his sister indicated that Mr. C suffered his first psychiatric break during adolescence. He was prescribed medication, but his parents, who indicated their preference for treating his condition with prayer, refused these. He has been living with his sister for the past 20 years and participates in all activities of daily living. He is a widower and is currently unemployed. His TBI history includes a single episode approximately 25 years ago when he fell off a moving train, requiring extended hospitalization. Mr. C was brought in to our Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital by his sister after calling the Veterans’ Crisis Line with SI. One week earlier there was an altercation with his brother-in-law resulting in Mr. C attacking him with a crowbar and the sister intervening. On admission, the family reported that Mr. C was taking venlafaxine and quetiapine.
Upon initial interview, Mr. C was grossly oriented, with psychomotor agitation, mildly pressured speech, anxious mood, and restricted affect. Thought process was tangential, and his cooperation was poor due to his preoccupation with delusions that he was dead, that nothing existed. He felt his body was being energized by demons: “These demons are my energy, I am dead, how can I have any energy?” He perseverated on this content despite attempts to engage him: “How can you help me, I am dead.” When asked about suicidal ideation (SI) he indicated, “I am dead, how can I be suicidal?” When providers commented on the novelty of speaking with a dead person, he replied, “Maybe you are dead too.” Importantly, his nihilistic beliefs included strong religiously mediated content not shared by his family. Mr. C. made the comments: “That physical God is alive because he has a physical body, but the demons inside me keep me dead, keep me from being alive.” “It is not nice meeting the devil, all the demonic spirits are tormenting me and raping me.” He believed his insides were being corroded by demons and indicated that he had repeatedly sodomized himself to try and purge himself of the demons. Mr. C’s sister indicated that the onset of his religiously themed delusional symptoms began after his TBI when he became convinced that a miracle had occurred during the accident and he became aware of his “dead nature.”
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in April 2015 revealed mild global volume loss for age with widening of the Sylvian fissure bilaterally. Neither evidence of past acute TBI or white matter abnormalities were noted on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging (Figure ). Neuropsychological testing administered during the index hospitalization was significant for impairment on tasks of processing speed, simple attention, verbal learning and memory, aspects of executive functioning (set-shifting, verbal fluency), facial recognition, and affect naming and recognition. Aspects of visuospatial discrimination and construction, confrontation naming, and visual memory were intact (Table ).
Upon initial presentation, given the patient’s aggressive and activated behavior as well as sleep difficulties, venlafaxine was discontinued and quetiapine was titrated to 700 mg. Divalproex was added during the admission for mood stabilization and titrated to 750 mg. During his 2 weeks on the inpatient ward repeated inquiry about his religious experience and his relationship to God led to changes in the content of Mr. C’s delusion from literal and concrete beliefs that he was physically dead to more abstract and metaphorical descriptions of spiritual death. His belief that only God was physically alive remained, and his belief that demons possessed his body persisted. Continued probing about the patient’s existence demonstrated further amelioration of the nihilistic content. A month into his admission when asked if his daily activities (eating, drinking, showering) were evidence that he was in fact physically alive, he indicated that he was ‘probably alive.’
Mr. C continued to be alert and oriented to person, place, and time, with evidence of increased insight into his preoccupation with his belief that he was dead. Approximately 1 month into his admission he recognized when the content of his speech began to focus on death, demons, and self-negation, at which point he would stop and remark, ‘There I go again talking about all that dead stuff.’ He was ultimately discharged after 5 weeks of hospitalization. On discharge, the patient’s brother noted that he was less delusional and more linear than at baseline.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 32-year-old nulliparous married woman presents with complaints of chronic lower abdomen pain, dyspareunia, and infertility. Her general physical examination was normal with body mass index of 22 kg/m2. On speculum examination, a longitudinal vaginal septum was seen in the proximal portion of the vagina and the cervix was partially seen beyond the septum, at a high up position []. On vaginal examination, a single cervix was felt high up, slightly deviated to the right, and a normal anteverted uterus. An ultrasound showed a subseptate uterus with midline thick muscular septum and normal adnexa. MRI revealed septate uterus with septa extending till the cervix [Figures and ]. No anomaly was found in any other organ.
To complete the diagnosis, consent was taken for vaginal septum removal, followed by diagnostic hysterolaparoscopy. The couple was given the option of septoplasty in the same sitting or later in case of pregnancy complications. They chose to have it later.
Under anesthesia, the vaginal septum was held in between two alles forceps and divided in between the two with cautery. After the septum was removed, two dimples were seen high up in the vagina. They were double cervix confirmed by magnification with the hysteroscope. Two separate sounds could be inserted through the two cervices, ruling out any cervical atresia []. The uterocervical length in both sides was 3.5 inches. Hysteroscope was introduced through both the cervices. The septum was found to be complete till the level of the cervix delineating two separate cervical canals and two cavities. Cavities on both sides of the septum were found to be similar in size. The two ostia were visualized on the respective sides of the uterus. On introducing the laparoscope, the fundus was found to be smooth with a 2 cm fundal midline fibroid and with normal tubes and ovaries []. Thus, a diagnosis of complete uterine septum with two cervices and longitudinal vaginal septum was made. On chromopertubation spill was seen on both sides.
After 6 weeks of the vaginal septum resection, she reported an improvement in the dyspareunia and the heaviness in the lower abdomen []. She is being kept under follow-up to look for pregnancy complications and manage accordingly.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.
