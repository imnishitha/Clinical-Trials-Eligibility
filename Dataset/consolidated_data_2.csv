"A 5.5-year-old boy visited the Endocrinological section of the Pediatric Unit of the General Hospital of Terni, Italy, due to short stature. His mother's height was 170 cm, and his father's height was 172 cm (target height: 177.5 cm = >50° centile). In his family history, there was paternal familiarity for psychotic crises in his adolescence and mother with thrombophilia and history of five pregnancies with three spontaneous abortions and two parts. The mother took cardioaspirine during the pregnancy. No genetic disease was reported in his family. The child was born at term via spontaneous vaginal delivery. The birth weight was 3.050 gr (10°-25° centile), and the birth length was 45 cm (below the third centile). A villocentesis performed at week 12 of gestation due to an alteration in nuchal translucency on obstetric ultrasound did not reveal any abnormality (46, XY). After birth, a small ventricular septal defect and mild bilateral pyelectasis were detected, but within 6 months, both of these abnormalities spontaneously disappeared. Bilateral orchiopexy was performed at 19 months of age for undescended testicles. Regarding linear growth, auxological data recorded by the primary care pediatrician revealed short stature that was 2 standard deviation (SD) below the 3° centile on the Italian cross-sectional growth charts for height () since the first months of life. In the last 2 years, the child has exhibited an even more exacerbated decline in his growth curve. Before entering the hospital, first-level laboratory tests for the evaluation of short stature (i.e., full blood count, inflammatory markers, renal function, hepatic function, coeliac screening, and thyroid function tests) had been already performed. No abnormal results were evidenced. The bone age was delayed by 2 years.
In the hospital, his height was 99.2 cm (<3 SD), his weight was 15.5 kg (<3° centile), and his growth velocity was 4 cm/year (<3° centile). His arm span was of 94 cm, and his sitting height was of 55 cm: height ratio was <95%, his sitting height: height ratio was therefore >56% (slightly over the upper normal limit of 55.5%), and his body mass index was below the 50th centile (pathological Rappold index >8). Furthermore, he presented with unusual facial features that included hypertelorism, low-set ears, a low posterior hairline, down-slanting palpebral fissures, pectus excavatum, and ogival palate (Figure ).
However, Madelung deformity was not suggested by clinical examination and not detected by wrist X-ray findings. Radiological and laboratory tests to rule out related renal, cardiac, ophthalmologic, and audiological abnormalities did not find any significant alterations. At an evaluation conducted by an infant neuropsychiatrist, the patient exhibited a mild cognitive impairment compared with the standard for his age that included a prevalent verbal difficulty compatible with the diagnosis of NS. EEG and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging results were normal. The peak growth hormone (GH) value in a clonidine stimulation test was in the normal range (12.7 mg/L). The IGF-1 level was 47 ng/mL (normal values for age: 32–259 ng/mL).
Although short stature was disproportionate, diagnosis of NS was suspected, and genetic tests of the PTPN11 gene were requested. The entire coding regions and intron-exon boundaries of the PTPN11 gene were amplificated by polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA and sequence specific primers. Both forward and reverse strands were directly sequenced using an automatic DNA sequencer. The results confirmed NS because a c.922A>G (rs28933386) heterozygous mutation in exon 8 of the PTPN11 gene leading to a p.Asn308Asp substitution was identified (reference transcript NCBI NM_002834.3 and NP002825.3). This mutation has already been described as pathogenic by Siegfried et al. ().
Due to the presence of a mesomelic short stature, the concurrent presence of two genetic mutations was considered and a genetic evaluation of the SHOX gene was requested. A test of chromosomal microarray analysis performed with the CGH array led to the identification of a micro-duplication at the level of the region PAR 1 (Xp22.33/Yp11.32) extended about 680 kb involving the SHOX gene. The microduplication in the pseudoautosomal region PAR1 has already been described in NS and its clinical significance therefore appears to be certain ().
GH treatment (0.2 mg/kg/wk) was prescribed. At a follow-up assessment 18 months after the initiation of GH treatment (weight-appropriate dosage), the following data were collected: height, 109.8 cm (<2 SD); weight, 18 kg (<3° centile); growth velocity, 7 cm/year (>90° centile); arm span:height ratio, 96%; sitting height:height ratio: 56%. Further evaluations have been scheduled for every 6 months.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 40-year-old male with no past medical history was found unconscious by bystanders after he had been out for a recreational jog. Upon the arrival of medical services, the patient was found to be in VF cardiac arrest and required two shocks before the return of spontaneous circulation. The downtime was reported to be about 15 minutes. Per history obtained from family members, the patient had never experienced any cardiac symptoms such as palpitations or chest pain and had no COVID-19 symptoms.
The patient had no significant personal medical history, took no medications, and exercised regularly with no difficulties. Family history was notable for coronary artery disease (CAD) in his brother, which had been diagnosed at age 50, and myocardial infarction (MI) in his father at age 72. There was no family history of sudden cardiac death.
Given the patient’s young age and absence of underlying cardiac issues, the differentials for his VF arrest were broad. Etiologies considered included ischemic heart disease, structural heart diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, anomalous origin of coronary arteries, myocarditis, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, primary electrical abnormalities such as long QT syndrome, and Brugada syndrome, and non-cardiac etiologies such as a massive pulmonary embolism (PE).
A basic metabolic panel showed no significant electrolyte abnormalities. The initial troponin-T level was within normal limits. Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission showed normal sinus rhythm, non-specific T-wave changes in anteroseptal leads, and a QTc of 445 ms (Figure ). A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal LV systolic and diastolic functions with no valvular pathology or regional wall motion abnormalities. A chest CT with PE protocol showed no significant pulmonary emboli. Per institutional policy, the patient was tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) via nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which returned positive. A subsequent SARS-CoV-2 antibody test was also positive.
The patient was emergently intubated for airway protection and taken to the catheterization lab where coronary angiography showed non-obstructive proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery disease with 55-60% stenosis and flow distal to the lesion with Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score of 3. Left circumflex and right coronary arteries were disease-free (Figures , ). The left ventriculogram showed normal systolic function with no wall motion abnormalities. The patient was then admitted to the ICU for therapeutic hypothermia. He received convalescent plasma, remdesivir, and dexamethasone for his COVID-19 infection. During his ICU stay, he had one episode of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the setting of agitation and hypoxia that terminated spontaneously in less than three seconds. He continued to improve and was eventually extubated and discharged home.
Later on, an outpatient single-photon emission CT (SPECT) pharmacological myocardial perfusion scan showed no anterior ischemia or scar (Figure ). A subsequent cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging showed normal LV and RV sizes and functions with no late gadolinium enhancement. The patient eventually received a single-chamber VVI implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) for secondary prevention of VF. Subsequent outpatient genetic testing with INVITAE® Arrhythmia and Cardiomyopathy Comprehensive Panel (Invitae, San Francisco, CA) revealed no genetic variants known to cause arrhythmia. At the one- and four-month follow-ups, the patient remained asymptomatic and ICD interrogation revealed normal sinus rhythm with no episodes of arrhythmia.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 70-year-old hypertensive and diabetic male patient was admitted to our ICU with respiratory distress following COVID-19 infection. Chest x-ray showed bilateral diffuse infiltrates. ABG on 15 L of oxygen by non-rebreathing mask showed severe hypoxia (Pao2/Fio2 < 100), and respiratory acidosis with pH 7.52, PO2 56.3, PCO2 31.5, SpO2 <90. We gave non-invasive ventilation (CPAP) support with Fio2 80%, pressure support 14, and PEEP 7 (cm H2O). On the third day of CPAP therapy, the patient was unable to maintain oxygen saturation (SpO2 < 92%) despite FiO2 100% and became more tachypnic (RR > 40). There was increased respiratory distress and SpO2 decreased to <90% despite FiO2 100%. We gave supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula with O2 flow 10 L by another flowmeter (). The patient became more comfortable, and SpO2 increased to 95%. ABG showed PO2 90 mm Hg, PCO2 35, and SpO2 97%.

"A 73-year-old male, medical doctor, widower for 2 years, lives in the house with his two children. He is a social ethicist, smoker for 40 years, and quitted smoking 18 years ago as a response for the diagnosis of pulmonary emphysema, asthma, and systemic arterial hypertension (SAH). 10 years ago, he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. For the long-term asthmatic status, he uses formoterol fumarate dihydrate 200 mg with bisoprolol hemifumarate 1.25 mg daily (inhaled bronchial dilator) 1x daily; for systemic arterial hypertension, losartan and hydrochlorothiazide 50/12.5 mg (morning and afternoon); for dyslipidemia, rosuvastatin 20 mg, AAS 100 mg.
Two months after starting SC, the patient reported having an important hypoglycemic attack (glucose level of 27 mg/dl) (). 3 hours after starting this episode, this patient still presented dysarthria, mental confusion, and loss of consciousness and was hospitalized in the ICU with good recovery after glucose replacement. The use of SC was suspended during the hospitalization period, and the medication for diabetes was resumed. After dismissal from the hospital, SC was reintroduced at a dose of 25 mg 3 times per day, and postprandial glucose remained around 138 mg/dl, even when consuming sweets; sulfonylurea (gliclazide) has been discontinued and home glycemia ranged from 101 to 117 mg/dl.

"A 58-year-old female patient, who was a known case of hypertension and hypothyroidism taking tablet L-thyroxine 50 mcg once a day and tablet metoprolol 25 mg twice a day regularly presented on 17th April 2020 with chief complaints of low-grade intermittent fever, generalized body ache, running nose and soreness of throat for last 3 days. Her reverse transcriptase by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 was done at Civil hospital, which returned positive. Her husband was also symptomatic for COVID-19 and was also tested positive. Both were admitted in Civil hospital on 19/4/2020. Her chest laboratory parameters including complete blood count and X-ray were normal []. She was treated with azithromycin 500 mg once a day for 3 days along with paracetamol 500 mg thrice daily apart from multivitamins. Patient became asymptomatic after 2 days. Her repeat RT-PCR for COVID-19 was done on 28th and 29th April 2020 which both returned negative after which she was discharged on 29th April 2020. Her husband had COVID-19 pneumonia for which he remained hospitalized in civil hospital for 23 days and was subsequently discharged on her regular medication for hypertension and hypothyroidism at home. She was asymptomatic for almost next 4 months.
On 17th August 2020, she again developed symptoms in form of intermittent 101°F fever, generalized body ache, dry cough, and throat pain. Her rapid antigen test (RAT) returned positive. Her husband was negative on this occasion. Patient needed rehospitalisation on 19th August 2020 where her RT PCR for COVID-19 also returned positive with cycle threshold (CT score) of 18 suggestive of high viral load, thus confirming a case of reinfection with COVID-19. Total antibody and immunoglobulin G antibody test for COVID-19 were negative suggestive of non-existent immunoglobulin memory from previous COVID-19 infection. Her inflammatory profile revealed CRP of 17.8 mg/L and IL-6 of 15.4 pg/ml with otherwise normal X-ray chest (shown below) and other reports.

"A 62-year-old, white, Caucasian, British-origin, male lorry driver was admitted to the hospital late on a Friday night after an unwitnessed single vehicle road accident. His lorry was by the side of the road and he was found unconscious in the vehicle and immediately transferred to the local District General Hospital. On admission, he had already fully recovered, being alert and orientated but he had no recollection of the accident. He was haemodynamically stable, with normal vital signs and no neurological deficit. He complained only at a moderate headache. Physical examination has revealed a bruise on the upper part of his left anterior chest wall, left shoulder and forehead. The rest of the examination was entirely normal. The radiological investigation that followed included cervical spine and left arm X-rays in which no fracture was noted. A mobile AP chest X-ray was also done on admission, in which it was demonstrated a dilated aortic arch (). A subarachnoid hemorrhage was found on a moderate quality brain CT-scan (), which was attributed to traumatic brain injury and the patient was transferred to the regional Neurosurgical centre as a post-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage for observation. During the next two days, the patient was well without any neurological defect and he has been gradually mobilized without any major complaint. On Monday however, brain CT interpretation by a more senior member of the medical staff suggested that this may not be a post-traumatic but rather an aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A CT angiogram confirmed that his SAH was of aneurismal origin, due to the rupture of an anterior communicating artery (Acom) aneurysm () which was the actual reason for his accident. As the patient was neurologically intact and stable, an embolisation procedure for endovascular treatment of this aneurysm was decided for the following day (day 5 since the SAH event). Under general anesthesia, the right common femoral artery was punctured and a 6F appropriate vascular sheath was placed following our protocol for endovascular procedures. During the first attempt to catheterize the aortic arch for the standard pre-embolisation angiogram, an unusual dilatation of the thoracic descending aorta was noted, just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. The combination of these findings with the bruise in the upper left chest, made us suspicious of an aortic injury. The embolisation procedure was abandoned and an aortogram revealed an aortic dissection just distal to the left subclavian origin (). The patient was woken up and a chest CT followed, which confirmed the diagnosis of a post-traumatic dissection of the descending aorta. Subsequently, he was transferred to the cardio-thoracic unit and an aortic stent was successfully deployed for endovascular repair of the dissection (). He had an uneventful recovery and two weeks later, endovascular treatment of his Acom aneurysm was performed with platinum coils (). At the same time, a posttraumatic dissection aneurysm of the right common carotid artery (CCA) at its cervical segment was also found (). This was clinically silent, treated conservatively at that stage [] and the patient was eventually discharged three weeks after the primary event. At the six month follow-up, the patient had made a very good recovery and returned to full activities. The aortic dissection was not visible anymore in imaging but there was a recurrence of the previous coiled Acom aneurysm due to coil compaction. Thus, a new embolisation procedure with platinum coils was performed to treat this aneurysm recurrence. At the same stage, the right CCA dissection aneurysm was endovascularly treated using platinum coils, as it showed no signs of regression [,].","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 69-year-old male patient presented with stuporous mentality after fall from 2-meter height. On admission, the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 7/15. Neurological exam revealed no further abnormalities. Brain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an ICH in the left temporal lobe with diffuse SAH and subdural hemorrhage (). A brain CT angiography revealed a pseudoaneurysm of MMA (). Sequentially, the patient was submitted to cerebral angiography and the left external carotid angiogram revealed a pseudoaneurysm arisen from the anterior branch of the MMA accompanied by dAVF at the middle segment of sphenoid ridge (). Through the right common femoral artery, a guiding catheter (Envoy 6 Fr; Cordis/Johnson & Johnson, Miami, FL, USA) was positioned in the left external carotid artery. We carefully naviated a microcatheter pre-shaped 45 degrees (Excelsior SL-10; Stryker Neurovascular, Fremont, CA, USA) under the guidance of a 0.014-inch microguidewire (Synchro 14; Stryker Neurovascular) to reach the juxtaproximal to the pseudoaneurysm via MMA. After the confirmation of the appropriate position of the microcatheter via repetitive superselective angiography (), embolization of a pseudoaneurysm and MMA was performed using 25% n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) (Hystoacryl; B. Braun, Melsnagen, Germany) mixed with iodized oil (Lipiodol; Guerbet, Aulnay-sous-Boid, France). We achieved angiographically complete occlusion of a pseudoaneurysm and dural AVF (). Follow-up brain CT scan showed no significant hematoma enlargement and well penetrated glue cast at the all the vascular lesions ().
The patient presented an improvement in consciousness for GCS score 15 after 12 days. However, at the 18-day after the procedure, the right side weakness and dysarthria were developed. Brain CT angiography and subsequent left internal carotid angiography revealed cerebral vasospasm at the distal segment of MCA with multiple low densitied at the left MCA territories (). Cerebral vasospasm was treated using intra-arterial (IA) nimodipin infusion, and it was improved. At discharge, dysarthria was improved, but right side weakness was remained (Grade 3).","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 42-year-old man with no past significant medical illness presented with headache. CT scan done showed subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) predominantly in the perimesencephalic cisterns []. Magnetic resonance imaging T1 gradient sequence also showed the hypointense signal suggestive of blood products in the perimesencephalic cisterns []. Fetal posterior cerebral arteries are seen on both the sides arising from the internal carotid artery [Figures and ]. DSA (digital subtraction angiogram) done subsequently revealed fusiform bulbous dilation involving both the cisternal and cortical segments of the left SCA []. Endovascular treatment in the form of parent artery occlusion was done under general anesthesia, with complete exclusion of the aneurysm from the circulation as seen on post-coiling angiogram []. Standard heparin protocol was followed and activated clotting time greater than 250 s was maintained during the procedure. Six-French (6F) Envoy (cordis) guiding catheter was placed in the distal vertebral artery. A combination of echelon-10 microcatheter (ev3) and transcend 0.014 microwire (Stryker) were used to access the aneurysms. Multiple Axium (ev3) coils were used to occlude the aneurysm. There were no intra- and periprocedural complications and patient was discharged on the 5th day after operation. The post-operative course was uneventful. The patient's neurological examination after 1 month was completely normal.

"A 64-year-old man, who had a history of hypertension, presented with headache and vomiting. CT scan showed SAH in the superior cerebellar cisterns []. DSA done revealed a fusiform aneurysm of the distal SCA, predominantly involving the branch of the cortical segment [Figures and ]. Standard heparin protocol was followed and an activated clotting time greater than 250 s was maintained during the procedure. 5F Envoy (cordis) guiding catheter was inserted in the distal vertebral artery. The aneurysm was accessed with a combination of micro-catheter (echelon-10) and micro-wire (traxcess12). Meticulous pre-shaping of the micro-catheter according to the shape of the target aneurysm aided in proper positioning of the micro-catheter in the aneurysm which was subsequently packed densely with the platinum micro-coils. Post-procedure angiogram showed complete exclusion of the aneurysm along with the branch of the cortical segment and preservation of the flow in the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) []. There were no untoward events in the post-procedure hospital stay and patient was discharged after 1 week. No neurological deficit was seen during the clinical follow-up after 1 month.

"A three-year-old male child was admitted to the pediatric ward of Dr. Ruth KM Pfau, Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK) with a one-year history of generalized weakness, loose motions, decreased appetite and intermittent fever not associated with rigors, chills or night sweats, an eight-month history of inability to walk and sit, polydipsia, polyurea, abdominal distention and loss of neck holding for 14 days. He had a previous history of hospitalization six months ago due to the same complaints. The patient was accompanied by his mother. He weighed 6 kg, is the 7th born child to his parents and was delivered at term to a 37-year-old G7P7 mother via normal vaginal delivery. The mother did not report any complications or illnesses during pregnancy. He cried immediately after birth, and there were no complications during or after birth. There is no consanguinity between mother and father. The child was vaccinated but was malnourished, with an unremarkable family history.
The patient also developed diarrhea which was bulky in consistency, green in color with seven episodes per day after every meal intake. Diarrhea was associated with abdominal distention and vomiting. The mother then started giving him a combination of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, after which diarrhea subsided. The child developed neck holding at four years of age, he started sitting at eight months and started walking with support at 12 months of age. The child was first breastfed within three hours of delivery and was exclusively breastfed up to six months. Complimentary feeding was started after six months with pulses, mashed potatoes, porridge and chicken. Breastfeeding was continued up to two years. Currently, the child takes 1-2 feeds per day. The personal history revealed that the patient was sleeping normally, but the appetite was decreased. The mother also noticed a weight loss, altered bowel habits, and micturition was normal.
On examination (O/E), the patient was lying on the bed irritated, severely wasted and emaciated with visible bony deformities. Initial vitals included blood pressure (BP) 110/70 mmHg, a regular pulse of 90 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and a low-grade fever of 100° F. The patient was anemic and dehydrated, while, there was no presence of edema, clubbing, cyanosis, and lymphadenopathy. On further examination, parietal and frontal bossing, rachitic rosary (Figure ), widening of wrists and knock knees (it's a valgus deformity in which legs curve inwards so that the feet are apart when the knees are touching) were found as well. On abdominal examination, it was soft, non-tender, distended with mild tenderness on both flank regions, with a centrally placed umbilicus. The liver was palpable three fingers below the right costal margin. Gut sounds were audible 3-4 sounds/min. All other systems were unremarkable.
The anthropometric measures of the child are as follows: weight = 6.5 kg, occipitofrontal circumference = 49.5 cm, height = 72.5 cm, mid-upper arm circumference = 8 cm, upper segment = 45 cm, lower segment = 27.5 cm, weight for height = 6.5/9 *100 = 72.2 (moderately low) and height for age = 72.5/94.6*100 = 76.6 (severely low).
On investigations performed, complete blood count (CBC) showed a hemoglobin (Hb) of 5.4 gm/dl, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 82 fl and a platelet count of 187,000/mL. The total leukocyte count (TLC) was 10.6 x 109/L, including 39% neutrophils and 48% lymphocytes. His inflammatory markers were raised with a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 23 mg/L [Normal (N) = 3] and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 115 mm/hr (N = 0-22) for men and (N = 0-29) for women. The clotting profile showed an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.01, while prothrombin time (PT) was 10.6 seconds.
The urea creatinine electrolytes (UCE) were within normal range except decreased potassium levels of 2.8 mEq/L. The levels of calcium, magnesium and phosphate in blood were 15.1, 1.9 and 4 mg/dL, respectively. The blood culture showed a growth of Burkholderia species. The urinalysis showed a pH of 5.0, specific gravity of 1.025, with the presence of protein and blood. Additionally, numerous red cells were seen along with yeast and 4-6 pus cells per high power field (HPF). The urine culture showed growth of Candida species. The stool analysis showed that the stool was hard, acidic, brown in color with 1-2 pus cells per HPF. His vitamin D levels came out to be 54.29 ng/mL, and parathyroid levels were 8.36 pg/ml. Liver function tests showed a total bilirubin of 0.28 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 0.21 mg/dL and levels of alkaline phosphate alanine aminotransferase were 368 and 3 units per liter, respectively.
The X-rays of the chest (Figure ), skull (Figure ) and femur (Figure ) are attached below. Additionally, ultrasound of kidney ureters and bladder (KUB) showed an incidental finding of bilateral renal calculi (right kidney at lower pole measuring 0.7 cm, in the left kidney at mid pole measuring 0.7 cm), along with bilateral grade 2 renal parenchymal changes. The urinary bladder was normal in thickness with no presence of focal mass, calculus or diverticulum.
Considering the diagnosis of OI, an ophthalmology review was done to look for lens dislocation and blue sclera, but neither was present in both eyes. However, the left eye showed a corneal thinning nasally, temporally and inferiorly.
During the hospital stay, the patient was intravenously given cefotaxime 220 mg, piperacillin-tazobactam 700 mg, and meropenem three times a day. Additionally, linezolid 70 mg was injected every eight hours, along with injections of bisphosphonate 7 mg for three days, amikacin 55 mg twice a day for 14 days and fluconazole 85 mg loading dose, 45 mg once a day for 10 days. The patient was also given a teaspoon of the combination (artemether and lumefantrine) once a day. Three pints of red blood cells were transfused as well, after which his Hb became 10.6 mg/dL. During the stay, the child had a prolonged course of fever with pancytopenia, which improved on injections of meropenem, amikacin, and fluconazole.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 46-year-old male visited the emergency department of our hospital on April 23, 2015 due to fever and headache for three days and impaired memory for half a day. The patient had experienced fever three days before, with a peak body temperature of 38.5 °C. No other discomfort was described. He had visited other hospitals before and was diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection based on haematological findings. However, his condition did not improve after treatment with intravenous levofloxacin. Within a half a day, he developed impaired memory, concomitant with speech disturbance, poor response, no significant limb movements and convulsions before being referred to the emergency department of our hospital. The patient had no medical history. No histories of food and drug allergies were obtained. The patient denied any prior history of smoking, heavy drinking or drug abuse. On arrival, the initial physical examination revealed the following: body temperature 38.0 °C, pulse 100 beats/min, respirations 26 breaths/min, blood pressure 144/76 mmHg, delirium, speech disturbance, equal size and round shape of bilateral pupils with diameters of approximately 3.0 mm, sensitive to light reflex, basically normal cranial nerve examination, limb muscle strength Grade V, negative bilateral pathological signs, and no ataxia. The patient’s neck was soft, and there were no signs of meningeal irritation. No significant findings were found on the cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations. No skin rashes or bleeding sites were observed after examining the entire body. The laboratory test results were the following: haematology: white blood cells (WBC), 12.5 × 109/L, neutrophil percentage, 87.6%; C-reactive protein (CRP), 56 mg/L; procalcitonin (PCT), 2.8 ng/mL; and D-dimer, 3.2 μg/mL. A chemistry panel and screens for infectious diseases and cardiac markers were generally normal. No abnormal findings were observed on chest X-ray or electrocardiogram. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed a curved high-density mass at the left sylvian fissure area and an ischemic lesion of the left temporal lobe (Fig. ).
As an emergency diagnosis, massive cerebral infarction (probable atherosclerosis of the left internal carotid artery system) was considered, and intracranial infection could not be excluded; appropriate treatments included aspirin for anti-platelet aggregation, atorvastatin for lipid regulation and plaque stabilization, and cefuroxime and acyclovir for anti-infection.
The patient experienced aggravated unconsciousness after two hours of admission, and physical examination showed the following: lethargy, aphasia, equal size and round shape of bilateral pupils with diameters of approximately 3.0 mm, sensitive to light reflex, shallow right nasolabial folds, immobilization of right limbs upon orbital pressure, movable left limbs, positive right pathological signs and negative left pathological signs. Further revascularization therapy was considered, and the patient was immediately transferred to undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). On the way to the radiology department, the patient experienced further aggravation of unconsciousness and entered a light coma, concomitant with limb seizure, gazing to the left of bilateral eyes, equal size and round shape of bilateral pupils with diameters of approximately 2.0 mm, and disappearance of the light reflex. Appropriate treatments included midazolam for epilepsy, mannitol for dehydration and intracranial hypotension. After termination of the seizure, re-examination of the brain CT showed a curved high-density mass at the left sylvian fissure area and a massive low-density area in the left temporal lobe with many high-density plot areas scattered within it. CT images also showed compressed deformation of the left ventricle and a shift of the brain midline to the right (Fig. ). Considering that the patient developed haemorrhagic transformation, he was admitted to the emergency intensive care unit for further management.
Eighteen hours after admission, the patient experienced further aggravation of unconsciousness and entered a moderate coma, concomitant with high fever (body temperature 39.9 °C), bilateral pupils: left versus right = 5.0 mm versus 3.0 mm, respectively, disappearance of the light reflex, increased muscle tone of the right limbs, and positive pathological signs of bilateral limbs. The brain CT re-examination showed expansion of the bleeding area, with overt signs of brain herniation. The patient underwent emergency left frontal temporal craniotomy, removal of the intracranial hematoma and a decompressed craniotomy performed by neurosurgeons. The intraoperative findings were as follows: dark red appearance of the left temporal brain tissue, concomitant with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH); an ostomy of approximately 0.2 cm was created along the left temporal sulcus; a visible purple blood clot was observed, concomitant with surrounding contused brain tissues; and a large vascular embolization could be observed in the hematoma cavity. Approximately 10 mL of the hematoma and contused brain tissues were removed and sampled for pathological evaluation. Histopathological examination showed haemorrhage, oedema and inflammatory changes in brain tissues, neutrophil infiltration into the vascular walls and surrounding tissues, and microvascular purulent thrombosis (Figs. –). The patient was transferred to the neurologic intensive care unit for further treatment after the operation. During the course of the treatment, negative findings were found for Chlamydia pneumoniae, mycopsslasma, influenza, tuberculosis, the TORCH panel, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); the sputum culture was negative, and the blood culture suggested Staphylococcus aureus. No abnormal findings were found on chest X-ray or ultrasound. In addition, two transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) examinations were normal, and there were no observations of valvular dysfunction or neoplasm. The following final diagnosis was considered: massive cerebral infarction, consistent with haemorrhagic transformation (the left internal carotid artery system, inflammatory thrombus), Staphylococcus aureus sepsis and symptomatic epilepsy. After two months of vancomycin anti-infective treatments and supportive and symptomatic treatment, the consciousness of the patient improved gradually, and several blood cultures were negative. He underwent rehabilitation and was discharged from the hospital on the 72nd postoperative day (POD). At discharge, his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was E4V4M6, and the modified Rankin scale score was 3.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 60-year-old male experienced dimmed vision in his left eye for 3 days prior to his first visit. The patient negated any other symptoms, including pain and diplopia. He had a history of two previous occurrences of possible ON – 30 years ago in his left eye and some 10 years later in his right eye. The patient had a history of hypertension and was currently on antihypertensive drugs. No relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) was present at his first examination. BCVA was 0.65 in the right eye and 0.5 in his left eye. A fundus examination revealed an atrophic and excavated disc in his right eye. An optic disc edema was present in his left eye. Retina was normal in both eyes. Laboratory tests for sarcoidosis, syphilis, and giant cell arteritis were analyzed, including determination of HGB, blood count, serum calcium, ESR, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), and Wassermann reaction (WR). All tests were normal or negative. Visual field and color vision were analyzed 3 days later; visual field test showed arcuate inferior defects in both eyes, with equivalent neural capacity of 67% in his right eye and 58% in his left eye. A Sahlgren’s saturation test (SST) color vision test revealed a more defective color vision in his left (20) than in his right (15) eye.
An orbital MRI carried out 1 week later revealed increased signal intensity in the parts of the left optical nerve sheath, possibly indicating OPN. The MRI also showed increased signaling in the retrobulbar fat of the left eye. No increased swelling of the extraocular muscles was evident.
The patient received a course of prednisone, 60 mg/day, which was tapered over 1 month, at which time he was examined again. BCVA was 1.0 in the right eye and 0.65 in his left eye. The optic disc edema had subsided substantially since the last fundus examination 1 month earlier. He received a new course of prednisone, starting with 25 mg/day, which was tapered to 7.5 mg/day until his next visit 2 months later. His BCVA was 1.0 in his right eye and 0.65 in his left eye.
Visual field testing again showed arcuate inferior defects in both eyes and abnormal thresholds, with equivalent neural capacity of 69% in his right eye and 61% in his left eye. A new MRI showed a slight regression of the enhancement around the left optical nerve since the last MRI. The results of a fundus examination revealed a pale papilla in both eyes. He remained on 7.5 mg/day prednisone, which was tapered over 14 weeks. At a new consultation 4 months later, BCVA was 1.0 in the right eye and 0.5 in his left eye.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"The proband (II-2 in Fig. ) is a 45-year old woman, who first presented to our university hospital at the age of 35 and was referred to us because of her pregnancy. She has congenital deafness, first experienced syncope at the age of 3, and was diagnosed with epilepsy. She was treated with anti-epilepsy medications; however, she subsequently experienced several instances of syncope. At the age of 13, she had a syncope event, and was suspected of having JLNS because of her congenital deafness and prolonged QT interval. Her syncope was diagnosed as an arrhythmic episode when she was aware of tachycardia and as epilepsy when she was not. She also had a subarachnoid hemorrhage at the age of 29.
When she first presented at our hospital, she was not taking beta-blockers, because of a history of asthma, but was taking mexiletine in addition to phenytoin. Her QTc was found to be prolonged (584 ms) at presentation and administration of atenolol was initiated. She delivered her baby (III-1 in Fig. ) through Caesarean operation at our hospital at the age of 35. At 37, she delivered her second baby (III-2 in Fig. ) through Caesarean operation at our hospital. Despite administration of beta-blockers, her QTc remained prolonged (600 msec at the age of 37, 780 msec at 44) (Figs. and ), which is not unexpected because treatment with beta-blockers in LQTS1 is not expected to overtly reduce QTc []. However, she continued to experience occasional syncope and finally underwent an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) operation at 38 years of age. Subsequently, she is in a stable clinical condition. Because the proband was suspected of JLNS and both infants had a measured QTc of 500 ms or greater within 1 month after birth, beta blockers were initiated and both children remain in stable condition at ages 10 and 8 (Figs. and ). QTc of the son (III-1 in Fig. ) was measured as 500 ms one month after birth, while the QTc of his sister (III-2) was 530 ms at birth.
The father (I-1) and mother (I-2) of the proband were first cousins. There is no history of sudden unexplained syncope or death of children or adults in the immediate family members, despite the prolonged QTc of the children.
Clinical evaluation and consultation of the proband and her family members were performed at Chiba University Hospital. Clinical phenotypes were deduced from the clinical history, physical examinations, and ECG. Blood samples were collected from the proband and her family members following genetic counseling, and written informed consent was obtained prior to sample collection.
Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes according to established protocols at our laboratory []. Entire coding exons, including the intronic boundaries of the genes, of KCNQ1 (NCBI ref: NM_000218) and other LQT causative genes (KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNJ2, SCN4B, KCNJ5) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), according to established protocols in our laboratory. Briefly, 30–100 ng of genomic DNA was subjected to PCR amplification with DNA polymerase (PrimeSTAR GXL DNA Polymerase; Takara Bio Inc., Kusatsu, Japan) and primer sets.
The amplicons were subjected to conventional sequencing with Sanger sequencers (Applied Biosystems 3730/3130 DNA analyzers; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The sequence data were processed with Gene Codes Sequencher Software (Takara Bio Inc.) and mapped to the human genome sequence (build GRCh37/hg19).
Genetic analysis was performed to screen all coding exons and the exon–intron boundaries of the KCNQ1 gene (NCBI ref: NM_000218.2, NP_000209.2) with concurrent screening of other LQT causative genes (KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNJ2, SCN4B, KCNJ5). We detected a novel homozygous nonsense variant, NM_000218.2:c.115G > T (p.Glu39X, in exon 1a), in the KCNQ1 gene of the proband, as well as a homozygous common variant (NM_000218.2:c.1343C > G, p.Pro448Arg) (Additional file : Table S1). Genetic screening of her mother (I-2) and children (III-1 and III-2) revealed that they were heterozygous for the nonsense variant (Fig. ). Her husband (II-3) was also screened and found to be heterozygous for the common variant (NM_000218.2:c.1343C > G, p.Pro448Arg). The proband is a child from a first-cousin marriage, and we have concluded the homozygous nonsense variant in the proband is the cause of her JLNS1. The proband was negative for pathogenic variants in other LQT causative genes, including the KCNE1 gene (Additional file : Table S1).","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"The patient was a 63-year-old man who met the DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. The onset of schizophrenia occurred in his early twenties. He had been treated with olanzapine (10 mg) for the last 4 years, but he had a tendency to stop the medication due to appetite and body weight. He was admitted to the hospital due to delusions and hallucinations at his older brother's funeral. Treatment with blonanserin (8 mg) and etizolam (1 mg, at night) was initiated for auditory hallucinations and delusions. At 2 weeks later, the patient complained of leg restlessness. His global score on the Barnes Akathisia Scale [] was 2. Substantial relief of akathisia was noted after 14 days of fluvoxamine (50 mg) treatment. His global score on the Barnes Akathisia Scale was 0.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A previously healthy 22-year-old Japanese man without a medical or surgical history presented to Anjo Kosei Hospital with complaints of fever and dyspnea. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 37.8°C and tachycardia. CT scans revealed a 14.4 × 9.8 × 10.0 cm mass in the anterior mediastinum with compression of the heart. Pertinent laboratory values included an AFP level of 31,536 ng/mL and an LDH level of 604 IU/L. His hCG level was within the normal range. Physical examination of the testes showed no neoplastic parenchymal involvement. A needle core biopsy revealed a malignant germ cell tumor, and immunohistochemical staining was positive for AFP. From these data, the patient was finally diagnosed with a yolk sac tumor.
The patient received combination chemotherapy consisting of BEP every 3 weeks for a total of 3 cycles. After that, an additional 2 cycles of EP chemotherapy were administered in order to normalize his serum tumor marker levels. His AFP level decreased to 46 ng/mL after 3 cycles of BEP and further normalized after 2 cycles of EP.

The initial proper management of open fracture and joint dislocation was performed by orthopaedic and traumatology surgeons in the emergency department. The patient had no history of additional diseases. The preoperative airway examination revealed a class 3 Mallampati airway and, in light of the difficulty of intubation, an intrathecal block with a 150 mm needle was planned. After the written consent was obtained, 2 mg IV midazolam and 50 μg fentanyl were administered for sedation. The vertebral anatomical structures were barely distinguishable despite ultrasound guidance. After two unsuccessful attempts, we decided not to use spinal anesthesia and planned to perform a combined sciatic and femoral nerve block. As a tourniquet was not required above the knee, the blockade of these two nerves would be adequate for surgical anesthesia.
Before the femoral nerve block, the pannus was taped cephalad as the fatty tissue hanging from the abdomen made it difficult to access the inguinal region. The femoral nerve was identified at a depth of 5 cm with a linear US probe (Esaote, 10–18 MHz, Florence, Italy). Fifteen mL (8 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine and 7 mL of 2% lidocaine) of local anesthetic mixture was administered around the femoral nerve using the in-plane approach. Due to the difficulties in situating the patient in the prone position, the distal extremities of the patient were elevated with folded blankets in the supine position (). The sciatic nerve could not be visualized despite several attempts using both linear and convex probes; therefore separate blocks of the tibial and common peroneal nerves were planned. The tibial nerve was identified in the popliteal fold, posterior to the popliteal artery at a depth of 3 cm (). Visualization of the tibial nerve was highly difficult in areas more proximal than the point 2 cm above the popliteal fossa. The common peroneal nerve (CPN) and the bifurcation of the sciatic nerve could not be visualized despite several attempts using both linear and convex probes. Therefore, 10 mL (7 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine and 3 mL of 2% lidocaine) of local anesthetic mixture was administered around the tibial nerve 2 cm above the popliteal fold by using a linear probe. Screening was performed in the distal direction over the lateral side of the patient's leg with the linear probe placed transversely on the edge of the patella to identify the CPN (). The nerve was visualized posteriorly and laterally to the fibular head, 4 cm distally to the edge of the patella at a depth of 2 cm (). At this level, 10 mL (7 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine and 3 mL of 2% lidocaine) of local anesthetic mixture was administered around the nerve with the in-plane technique using a linear probe. A 100 mm 21-G echogenic needle (Pajunk, Geisingen, Germany) was used for all blocks. A nerve stimulator was not used for any blocks since the patient had extremity pain associated with trauma. Surgical anesthesia was established within 30 minutes after anesthetic administration and no complications occurred in association with the blocks. Emergent reduction and fixation with an external fixator were performed for the ankle dislocation and fracture of the tibia. Additional local anesthetic injection or additional sedation was not required during the operation. The operation lasted for approximately 1.5 hours and was completed without problems. The patient's consent was obtained for the publication of this case report.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 15-year-old male patient visited the clinic due to erythematous lesions on the face, neck, and elbow. He suffered from atopic dermatitis from infancy which had been more aggravated during the last year. He received standard treatment with persistent fluctuation. His clinical severity was improved from 29 to 16.5 (points) after 24 Histobulin injections. The laboratory and skin test results before and after treatment are shown in Figure . The severity score of atopic dermatitis was improved gradually with 24 Histobulin injections.

"A 43-year-old woman presented with post-Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccination keloid scars on both shoulders. A protruding lesion had developed at the center of the keloid scar on her right shoulder 3 months prior. The lesion had increased in size, and she had squeezed out the lesion's contents several times. However, the lesion had become swollen again and was painful. When she visited our clinic, the lesion had already ruptured, and inflammation had spread to the surrounding keloid scar tissue. The keloid scar on the patient's right shoulder measured about 9 × 7 cm, and the ruptured lesion measured 2 × 1.5 cm (Fig. A). We excised all the keloid tissue including the ruptured lesion, and repaired the wound using subdermal 3-0 PDS (Ethicon, Inc., Somerville, NJ) and interrupted 5-0 Ethilone (Ethicon, Inc.) sutures, primarily (Fig. B–D). Histopathologically, a large laminated keratin-filled cyst was present in the dermis surrounded with a dense collagenous keloid scar (Fig. E). The cyst wall consisted of stratified squamous epithelium with a granular layer, which was consistent with an EC. The adjacent dermis contained characteristic broad, eosinophilic, and homogeneous keloidal collagen bundles (Fig. F). There were no postoperative complications, such as an infection or wound dehiscence. The stitches were removed 14 days postoperatively, and Steri-Strip skin closures were applied for 1 month to prevent wound dehiscence and scar widening. Subsequently, the patient used Mepiform and applied a personalized compression garment for 5 months (Fig. G and H). There were no EC recurrences or keloid overgrowth during the 1-year follow-up period, and the patient was satisfied with the final outcome.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"In another case, a 73-year-old female with a long smoking history was referred to thoracic surgery for a slow-growing nodule in her left upper lobe. A CT scan showed a 2.3 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm GGO nodule in the anterior left upper lobe (Figure ). At this time, a three-month follow-up was recommended. A repeat scan showed unchanged size and configuration of the nodule. The patient was recommended to follow-up in six months, but she did not return for almost a year. At that time, a biopsy was performed showing alveolar atypia consistent with AAH (Figure ). A repeat CT was performed six months following the biopsy and the nodule became ""semisolid"" with both solid and GGO features here (Figure ). At no time did any of the CT scans demonstrate mediastinal adenopathy or other abnormality. The patient's case was presented at the multi-disciplinary tumor board and surgical consultation was recommended.
Upon presentation to thoracic surgery, the patient continued to smoke. She denied any symptoms of cough, weight loss, or change in appetite. Given the location and concerns for potential malignancy within the previously identified atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, the patient was consented for lobectomy. The patient underwent an uneventful left upper lobectomy and lymph node dissection. Final pathology showed two foci of invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, acinar pattern (Figure -). Multiple lymph nodes were positive for malignancy including 4L, 11L and other peribronchial nodes with no evidence of distant metastases or brain metastases on CT and PET scan. The patient’s final pathology demonstrated her to be T3N2M0. She was referred to medical oncology for chemotherapy and radiation oncology for radiation.
Together these cases demonstrate the varying opinions on clinical management of AAH and to date, there is no empiric treatment for AAH. Traditional treatment options include surgical resection or observation with serial CT scans. The role of SBRT is unknown due to lack of data on the use of SBRT in treating AAH. In addition, the latter case demonstrates that AAH can act as precursor lesion of adenocarcinoma.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"This patient is a 7-year-old boy with compound heterozygote mutations in LDLR c.666C>A and c.1646C>A. The patient has a sister with HoFH who is on LA and not part of this patient series. Both parents have HeFH. The patient has a large aortic plaque extending the length of the thorax with 25–50% narrowing of the lumen.
Before lomitapide, the patient was treated with rosuvastatin 40 mg/day, ezetimibe 10 mg/day and colesevelam 625 mg/day. No LA was used as a result of venous access issues. LDL-C levels were increased at 866 mg/dL. The patient underwent dose reduction of rosuvastatin (20 mg) and was commenced on lomitapide 2.5 mg/day, which was gradually escalated to 30 mg/day in 5-mg increments. LDL-C levels reduced by 78% to 360 mg/dL (Fig. ).

"A 47-year-old Chinese man presented to our department of ophthalmology with a 26-month history of left upper eyelid painless swelling and redness. The patient was initially treated with a course of intravenous penicillin, which resulted in temporary regression of the lesion. There had been no similar family history of this appearance to date.
Physical examination revealed that the left lacrimal gland was obviously swelling, which presented with a soft, non-tender and smooth-surfaced. Slit lamp examination was otherwise unremarkable aside from bilateral mild cataract. Laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 9.8 × 10-9/L with 15.91% eosinophils(normal range: 0.05-0.5 × 10-9/L). Serum concentration of immunoglobulin E was elevated at 469.3 IU/ml, and immunoglobulin G4 was 295 mg/dL (normal range less than 135 mg/dL). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination of the orbit showed that the left lacrimal gland was lobulated with a distinct margin and was predominantly isointense on T1-weighted images. Isointense on T2-weighted images and an obvious heterogeneous enhancement on contrast-enhanced MRI images are shown in Figure . The chest radiograph was normal and no cervical lymph nodes were palpable.Next, we advised the patient to be hospitalized and the patient underwent an orbital biopsy. Intraoperative frozen sections were reported as being consistent with a benign tumor. Therefore, a complete resection was undertaken. Perioperatively, it was noted that the mass had a smooth and homogeneous grey appearance. There was no evidence of haemorrhage or cystic change and borders were indistinct. A definite diagnosis of KD was made by histopathology and immunohistochemical examinations of representative resected specimens after surgery. Histopathological examination demonstrated follicular hyperplasia with evidence of reactive germinal centres. Eosinophilic infiltration, involving the interfollicular areas, and proliferation of post capillary venules were observed. These features enabled a diagnosis of KD to be made (Figure A). Further analysis, including immuohistochemistry, was undertaken, demonstrating positive staining for CK, Vimentin, CD3, CD4, CD20, CD21, CD117, CD5, CD8, CD23, IgG and IgG4 (30 per high-power field) and negative staining for CD10 and CD34 (Figure B), the ratio of IgG4 to IgG positive cells was about 35%. The pathological diagnosis, which was also the final diagnosis, was KD. However, some ophthalmologists questioned whether the histological and immunohistochemical findings were also had common features with IgG4-related disease, which is a newly recognized fibro-inflammatory condition characterized by tumefactive lesions, a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate rich in IgG4-positive plasma cells, storiform fibrosis, and elevated serum IgG4 concentrations.
The patient was discharged following his surgery and treated with prednisone 25 mg/day for four weeks and then reduce by 5 mg/day every two weeks. His symptoms gradually improved. Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels dropped to 125.9 IU/mL and eosinophil’s decreased to 0.69 × 109/L after 2 months. There was no sign of recurrence in twelve months of regular follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 70-year-old gentleman presented with a painless swelling in the right thigh for 7 months, which was spontaneous. He had a history of femur shaft fracture, for which open femur nailing was done 10 years ago. Postoperatively, he had uneventful wound healing and fracture union. He has no recollection of any complications following the surgery and was able to walk full-weight-bearing without any aid. Clinically, he had a large diffuse swelling on the anterolateral aspect of the right thigh which was around 10 cm × 8 cm. The swelling was firm, non-tender, and non-pulsatile, with ill-defined margins. The presence of a longitudinal scar along the entire length of the lateral aspect of the thigh was noted, which had healed by primary intention (). The right hip and knee movements were normal. Routine hematological tests were done, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. All the blood reports were normal.
X-rays of the femur were done in anteroposterior and lateral views () which showed an irregular, hypertrophic cortical reaction with the bony remodeling in the proximal femur and an excavated lateral femoral cortex with a broken intramedullary nail in situ.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right thigh was done, which showed a large, well defined, and heterogenous soft-tissue mass on the anterolateral aspect (T1 and T2 images). Post-contrast images showed a heterogeneous and patchy uptake (). These findings were consistent with a soft-tissue tumor. We, however, did not perform a computed tomography (CT) scan for this patient.
After the MRI, we decided to do a closed needle biopsy along the previous surgical scar under local anesthesia in the operating theatre. The biopsy report was inconclusive, demonstrating fibrinous blood material and granulation tissue suggestive of a chronic hematoma.
As the patient was symptomatic, we decided to plan a surgical excision of the lesion. Under epidural anesthesia, in the supine position. The skin incision was taken along the previous scar on the lateral aspect of the thigh. Granulation tissue and fibrosed muscles overlying the mass were carefully separated. We noticed a mass adherent to the lateral aspect of the femur extending intramedullary up to the implant. Using a cautery, we separated the mass from the bone extending up to the intramedullary nail. The excised specimen measured 24 cm in length and 15 cm in breadth. An intraoperative frozen section analysis was done that revealed a chronic inflammatory reaction and no evidence of sarcoma. The defect after excision of the mass was filled with frozen allograft. The excised specimen was solid with a fibrotic wall; on gross examination, after dissecting the specimen, a mop was found ( and ).
The sample was sent for histological study which revealed fibrous strands, clots, hemolyzed pigments of red blood cells inflammatory cells, and multiple fiber strands. The foreign material was studied under polarized light () and confirmed the diagnosis of gossypiboma by demonstrating cotton fibers. The specimen was reported as an accumulation of blood products and their degraded components and not a tumor.
The patient had an uneventful surgical procedure and was mobilized and rehabilitation was started on day 1 postoperatively.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 78-year-old woman was referred to our clinic with bilateral hearing loss with sound distortion, tinnitus and auditory hypersensitivity, recurrent vertigo/dizziness induced by loud noises (Tullio phenomenon), and a diagnosis of bilateral SSCD at the temporal bone HRCT performed in the emergency room (Figures 2a–c).
Preoperative audiometry indicated severe mixed hearing loss in the right ear, with moderate conductive hearing impairment in the left ear (). A pure tone sound of 110 dB at 500 and 1,000 Hz in the right ear, and pneumatically increasing external auditory canal pressure induced dizziness without detectable nystagmus on video-oculographic (or Frenzel goggles) examination. Her tympanogram was bilaterally normal. A stapedial reflex could not be performed due to patient intolerance (dizziness). Mastoid vibration elicited dizziness without detectable nystagmus on video-oculographic (or Frenzel goggles) examination. A temporal bone 1.5-T MRI with 3D reconstruction performed two months before did not show the bilateral dehiscence (). Air conduction cervical VEMPs (cVEMPs) demonstrated a threshold of 85 dB HL on the right side and 100 dB HL on the left side. The cVEMPs were recorded from both ears using 500 Hz short tone-bursts (STBs). A video head impulse test for horizontal and vertical canals, including both dehiscent SSC, showed normal vestibulo-ocular reflex gain bilaterally ().
Possible surgical procedures (superior canal plugging or resurfacing either through a middle fossa approach or via a transmastoid route, or RW niche plugging) were discussed with the patient. Comorbid cardiopulmonary conditions represented major contraindications for general anesthesia, so the latter procedure was the only possible option to pursue.
Since the patient did not show bilaterally any benefit from an air conduction hearing aid but rather had deteriorating auditory and vestibular symptoms on the right, we decided to perform the surgical procedure in the right ear as it had worse vestibular and auditory symptoms, a poorer hearing threshold, and greatly altered HRCT and VEMPs findings.
With local-assisted anesthesia, we performed a transcanal approach with elevation of the tympanomeatal flap and preservation of the chorda tympani nerve with a minimally invasive retroauricular incision. Ossicular mobility and continuity were assessed, we excluded the stapedial fixation, and no cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak was observed during the surgical procedure. After identification and reshaping of the RW niche, a vibroplasty was performed paying particular attention to correctly plugging the round window and coupling it with the floating mass transducer (FMT) of the VSB (). We opted to couple the FMT with the RW because concomitant RW plugging was performed and from previous studies it seemed to provide a more stable coupling over time than incus (). No ossicular chain abnormalities or perilymphatic fistula were observed intraoperatively.
The plugging of the round window was achieved using cartilage and perichondrium (tragus). This autologous tissue also helped to seal off the FMT in the round window niche. Furthermore, VSB hearing outcomes were monitored with electrocochleography using a cotton-wick recording electrode placed on the hypotympanum () ().
The wire of the VSB was housed in a canal tunnel drilled up to the tympanic attic. Minimal drilling of the cortical temporal bone posterosuperior to the external auditory meatus was necessary to house the implant receiver and extra wire (). The ear canal tunnel was covered with autologous cartilage and external auditory meatus packing was performed.
This study received an exemption from the ethics committee of the University Hospital of Siena (Comitato Etico Regione Toscana, area vasta Sud Est–AOU Senese, Usl Toscana Sud Est) on 10/21/2019 for publication.
Surgery was uncomplicated, the patient did not complain of any post-operative vestibular symptoms. Sutures and external meatus packing were removed on the 10th postoperative day. At the 1-month follow-up, the patient underwent VSB activation and hearing and vestibular examination. She reported a significant improvement in auditory hypersensitivity and reduced sound distortion although tinnitus remained unchanged. No disabling vestibular symptoms were reported. Neither dizziness nor nystagmus could be observed in response to loud sounds or increased external ear pressure on the right side. The postoperative pure tone audiogram revealed a mild increase at 500, 1,000, and 2,000 Hz and a mild decrease at 250 and 4,000 Hz for bone conduction thresholds (). An improvement to moderate hearing loss in the VSB-aided hearing threshold was confirmed at 3 months (). The maximum speech recognition score of bysillabic words at 65 dB HL improved from 10% preoperatively to 70% at the last follow-up. The improvement of hearing and vestibular symptoms was confirmed subjectively by the patient on the right side. Discomfort and mild dizziness associated with loud sounds on the left side remained unchanged. Using a visual analog scale (0–10), the patient reported an improvement in symptoms from 10 to 4 and from 9 to 2, respectively, for hearing and vestibular complaints (3-month follow-up). Left side mild symptoms related to dehiscence remained unchanged. No short-term surgical complications such as device extrusion or external or middle ear canal infection/inflammation were identified at the 3-month follow-up (). Control HRCT was not performed since correct positioning of the FMT and plugging of the RW were confirmed by improvements in symptoms and stability of VSB-aided hearing. Air conduction VEMPs were not performed for safety reasons due to the risk of mobilizing the plugging or FMT from the RW.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 40-year-old woman originally from Ecuador was referred to our institution for evaluation of progressive dyspnea on exertion. Two months prior to her presentation, she was treated at an outside hospital for presumed community acquired pneumonia with symptoms of dyspnea on exertion, fevers, chills, and productive cough. After not seeing measurable improvement, the patient then presented to the emergency department at another institution where a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed that the patient had a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology and a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60%. Pericardiocentesis was performed with 700 cc of fluid removed, which grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). The patient's purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test was positive. The patient was started on anti-TB therapy and discharged.
She continued to complain of persistent dyspnea on exertion and thus was referred to our institution for a repeat of TTE at the outpatient cardiac diagnostic center. TTE revealed the rare presystolic flow through pulmonic valve, excessive variation in the mitral valve and aortic valve spectral Doppler velocities, and markedly thickened pericardium (Figures –), consistent with constriction []. The study also demonstrated septal bounce, small pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion. The patient was admitted for further evaluation. On admission, the patient's vital signs showed a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, a blood pressure of 108/70, a heart rate of 117, and respiratory rate of 20 with an oxygen saturation of 99% in room air. Her exam revealed a young woman in mild distress with 11 cm internal jugular vein distension, decreased breath sounds at lung bases bilaterally and scant bibasilar crackles, regular tachycardia, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Her BNP was 124, CRP was 5.1, and WBC count was 5.9 with a normal differential. Her complete metabolic panel was unremarkable. The patient underwent a left and right heart catheterization due to the suspicion of constrictive pericarditis. A coronary angiogram demonstrated no obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease. The right heart catheterization revealed elevated right atrial pressure, right ventricular end diastolic pressure, and an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Simultaneous right and left ventricular pressure tracings demonstrated discordant respiratory variation consistent with constrictive pericarditis. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her chest with contrast confirmed marked thickening of both the parietal and pleural pericardial surfaces, measuring up to 13.4 mm in thickness, and a large right-sided pleural effusion (Figures and ). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast showed diffuse pericardial thickening (), which showed intense delayed gadolinium contrast enhancement () that did not involve the myocardium. Additionally, there was a greater interventricular septal bounce during diastole and inspiration, consistent with chronic inflammatory constrictive pericarditis.
Due to her worsening symptoms and diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis, she was referred to cardiothoracic surgery at our institution for pericardiectomy. The surgery was without incident and the surgical samples were sent for pathology. While being negative for AFB by concentrated smear and culture, the stripped pericardium showed noncaseating granulomas, extensive fibrosis, and severe lymphohistiocytic infiltrate.
In the immediate postoperative period, the patient began to develop signs and symptoms of central volume overload, heart failure, and hypotension. An electrocardiogram (ECG) at this time showed sinus tachycardia with nonspecific ST-T abnormalities with poor R wave progression, new from prior ECGs. A subsequent TTE on postoperative day one showed significant changes from the prior study, with severely decreased biventricular dysfunction. The LVEF was severely depressed at 26%, with early evidence of elevated filling pressure within the left ventricle, indicated by the time difference between pulmonary vein (Ar) duration and mitral A-wave duration (Ar-A) of positive 46 ms. For the right ventricle, fractional area change (FAC) was abnormally low at 29%, with reduced tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) distance of 0.96 cm. There was also moderate tricuspid regurgitation, enlarged right atrium (area 27 cm2), and moderately elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 41 mmHg. There was akinesis of the entire apical and midventricular segments of both the right and left ventricles (Figures –) with hypercontractile base. Findings were consistent with stress cardiomyopathy.
While in critical condition postoperatively, the patient had episodes of atrial fibrillation and atrial tachycardia, for which she was chemically cardioverted with intravenous amiodarone, with subsequent conversion to sinus rhythm. Initially, the patient required multiple vasopressors and inotropes (epinephrine, norepinephrine, milrinone, and dopamine drip) to maintain her blood pressure and cardiac output, while gentle diuresis was achieved carefully for the symptoms of heart failure. Once the patient was hemodynamically stable, she was placed on appropriate oral medical therapy, including carvedilol and furosemide, followed by gradual clinical improvement and was able to be discharged on postoperative day 10. Due to decreased urine output and hypotension, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker was not initiated at the time. A posthospital TTE 7 weeks after discharge showed normalized function of both the right and left ventricles (Figures –).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 59-year-old female patient presented to her local family doctor with chronic generalized intermittent colicky abdominal pain and altered bowel habit for a few months. She has no other associated symptoms. She previously had laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) insertion 8 years prior with good result (BMI pre-procedure was 56 kg/m2, and now 36 kg/m2). Her other comorbidities include hypertension and colonic diverticular disease with previous acute diverticulitis. She was organized to have an elective colonoscopy. Colonoscopy revealed tubular foreign body embedded in the wall of colon, with an entry and exit point, ~55 cm from anal verge (Fig. ). There was also significant sigmoid and descending colon diverticular disease.
CT abdomen with oral and intravenous contrast was organized to further investigate the tubular foreign body. It revealed concurrent gastric band erosion into gastric lumen and connection tubing eroding into the posterior wall of transverse colon and exiting inferiorly (Figs –). There was no evidence of any oral contrast leak from the stomach.
This patient has previously been admitted for acute diverticulitis 4 years prior. Reviewing prior imaging did not reveal any gastric or colonic erosion. The gastric band tubing is noted to be running along the inflamed colon. Since the initial admission for acute diverticulitis, she has had multiple further acute diverticulitis episodes, which were treated with oral antibiotics. We suspect recurrent diverticulitis lead to the erosion of the gastric band into the colon and stomach.
As part of the surgical management, both colorectal and upper GI surgeon were involved in the operation. Patient underwent laparoscopic removal of gastric band and laparoscopic assisted wedge resection of transverse colon. The gastric band was removed following adhesiolysis and the gastric defect was repaired with intracorporeal suturing. The gastric band port was subsequently removed. Gastroscopy was done to ensure the repair was airtight. For the colectomy, transverse colon and splenic flexure was mobilized laparoscopically and the transverse colon was extracted through the gastric band port site for external inspection. A tract was identified passing from the antimesenteric border to colonic lumen and then along the colonic mesentery. A wedge resection performed with stapler end to side anastomosis. Flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed to confirm the anastomosis was airtight. Her post-operative recovery was uneventful, and she continued to be well on post-operative follow up in clinic. She remains well on subsequent phone follow up 12 months post operatively.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 35-year-old right-handed man who worked in a bank was admitted to hospital with complaints of neck pain and left-sided weakness. The patient had developed a sharp pain in the left side posterior aspect of his neck and occiput after a 4-hour flight, 4 weeks before presentation. At the time he felt nauseated but did not vomit, and he was treated conservatively with ultrasound and massage. The weakness began acutely after he had turned his head to one side and rapidly progressed from his left leg to his left arm. He was immediately unable to walk and subsequently began to experience tingling sensations in his right arm and leg.
There was no history of head trauma or neck manipulation, no past medical or surgical history, and no previous use of medications or previous infectious symptoms. The patient was a non-smoker, did not have diabetes and was normotensive. There was no family history of thrombophilia or venous throboembolism. Both his father and uncle had suffered from ischemic strokes in their late forties. He was born in the Philippines and had lived in Canada since early childhood.
On examination, level of consciousness, cognition and speech were normal. His blood pressure was 144/96 mmHg. The cranial nerve examination was normal. There was Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 4 out of 5 weakness affecting the left arm and left leg, with active movement possible against gravity and minimal resistance. Pinprick and temperature sensation were diminished on the right side from the second cervical vertebra (C2). Vibration and joint position were diminished on the left side below C2. The left plantar reflex was equivocal and the right was flexor. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The results of the examination were consistent with a Brown-Séquard syndrome on the left at the level of C1-C2.
Hematologic, biochemical and immunologic investigations were normal and electrocardiogram and chest radiography were unremarkable. The lumbar puncture cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein was 0.22 g/l and glucose was 4.9 mmol/l (blood glucose 8.8 mmol/l). There was one white cell, two red cells, no oligoclonal banding and no xanthrochromia in 10 ml of CSF.
T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging performed 2 days after presentation revealed a hyperintense signal associated with restrictive diffusion from the left inferior medulla and obex to the level of C2-C3, consistent with infarction (Figure ). Three-dimensional time-of-flight MR angiography showed narrowing of the left vertebral artery over the arch of C1 with a high signal parallel to the narrowed lumen, consistent with intramural hematoma and dissection (Figure ).
The patient was started on anticoagulation therapy with heparin and bridged to warfarin as secondary prevention. When the patient was discharged one month later, he was doing well, with improving, although not yet normal, strength in his left arm and leg.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 30-year-old woman from Saudi-Arabia was admitted to our department of internal medicine with the strong suspicion of first manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia. Laboratory testing showed mild anemia and thrombocytopenia with normal leukocyte count. The differential blood cell count, however, showed 47% leukemic blasts. A bone marrow biopsy was performed immediately. With approximately 90% blasts the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was confirmed. Flow cytometry showed an expression of CD34, HLA-DR, CD38 and cyMPO. A cross-lineage of CD56 was found, which correlates with a poor prognosis []. Cytogenetics and molecular analysis of the bone marrow cells revealed an ETV6-gen deletion in 12p13. According to the hematologic protocol intensive induction chemotherapy with HAM (high-dose Ara-C and Mitoxantron) was immediately initiated.
On day 8 after admission (2 days after the first cycle of chemotherapy was finished) the patient developed neutropenic fever up to a temperature of 39.4°C. The first laboratory testing showed a decrease in leukocytes down to 0.4 G/l with a C-reactive protein (CRP) less than 0.1 mg/dl. Escherichia coli with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was isolated from initially taken blood cultures, whereas all other clinical and diagnostic examinations (x-ray of the chest, urine, echocardiography and ultrasonography) were normal. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics was immediately initiated with Piperacillin/Tazobactam and switched to Meropenem after microbiologic testing confirmed ESBL sepsis. On that first day of fever, the patient told us, that she fell in the bathroom hurting her right knee two days before (day 6 after admission). There was no apparent injury on her leg. On further clinical examination, besides fever, her vital signs were always normal. In the course of the next 2 days neutrophils dropped below 0.1 G/l and CRP levels soared to a peak of 29.9 mg/dl. Highest procalcitonin level (PCT) measured was 1.7 ng/ml. Three days after the patient suffered from the minor injury to her lateral thigh, she suddenly presented a small hematoma with only little pain (day 9 after admission). There were no signs of superinfection of the hematoma explaining the clinical and laboratory signs of this unclear systemic infection. On that day, the patient was first presented to the surgical department. Within the next two days, the hematoma rapidly changed to a big untypical necrosis of the skin (day 11 after admission, see Figure ). Therefore, the patient was again presented to the surgical department. The patient was still in a good general condition with only little pain. A CT scan was initiated and showed entrapped air under the site of necrosis. Although the skin manifestation was not typical for a necrotizing soft tissue lesion, we considered the possibility of an untypical case of NF during severe neutropenia. Therefore, a surgical exploration was performed immediately (see Figure ). Macroscopically, subcutaneous tissue, fascia and muscle showed the typical characteristics of necrotizing fasciitis with grey necrotic tissue, facial edema, vessel thrombosis and non-contacting muscle. Intraoperative, there was only minimal resistance dissecting the subcutaneous fascia off the deep fascia, which is commonly described as positive “finger test” []. The histological findings showed facial necrosis, vasculitis, thrombosis and suppuration of the veins and arteries coursing through the fascia. But, there were no signs of disease-causing bacteria or infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the deep dermis and fascia as expected. First microbiological testing did not find any bacteria. The initial histopathological report could not confirm the typical picture of necrotizing fasciitis (see Figure ). In the further course of time, intensive care medicine was needed. After confirmation of adequate morphologic blast clearance in the bone marrow supportive treatment with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was added on day 18 (after start of chemotherapy). Neutrophils eventually recovered on day 23 (>500/μl). After beginning to recover, histopathological analyses of additional specimen of surgical resections showed the expected typical pathological findings like inflammatory cells and bacteria. Furthermore, microbiological testing confirmed ESBL infection. A multiplicity of operations with extended debridement was performed in order to eradicate the infection using negative pressure wound therapy. After successful eradication the skin defect involved the complete lateral thigh including nearly the whole circumference of the lower leg. In the further course of time, the immense skin defects had to be prepared for further reconstructive surgery. Reconstructive surgery with mesh graft harvest was complicated by the limited residual skin available on the lower extremity and the delay on wound healing of the harvest sites. Due to unfavorable cytogenetics and the complicated course of treatment our patient was assigned to undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation in first remission. But, the transplantation was only possible with wounds totally closed. It took another six surgical interventions and nearly eight months to finally close all wounds (see Figure ). After further recovery the patient underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation as planned. Today, she is doing well and there is no evidence of disease.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 50-year-old woman presented to the Breast Unit of Sant’ Anna and San Sebastiano Hospital of Caserta, Italy, after becoming aware of a non-tender lump in the median areolar area of her right breast. She first noticed the mass one month previously. During this period, she did not have any pain or discharge from the nipple. Further, she had no family history of malignancy, including breast cancer. She was in antihypertensive therapy.
She had never undergone any radiation and hormone replacement therapy. On physical examination, the patient had a demarcated, mobile, firm and fast-growing mass in her right breast.
The mass was not tender, approximately 4 cm in diameter, and was detected in the median areolar area of the right breast. There was no clinical evidence of regional lymphadenopathy.
Mammography revealed an opaque and ovoid lesion occupying the median equatorial region of the right breast; this lesion was 35 mm in diameter, with regular margins, moderate intensity and homogeneous density; there was no evidence of defined focus of pathological calcification (Figure ). Ultrasonography revealed a bulky, firm, hypoechoic lesion, with blurred and irregular margins, richly vascularized on color Doppler, with high speed systolic flow. This mass was 45 mm in diameter, and referred to as a heteroplastic lesion. There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy.
Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration on the lesion showed epithelioid and spindle cells, which were positive only to the immunohistochemical staining for vimentin and so we suspected a mesenchymal lesion.
An ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy performed subsequently showed connective tissue, including cells similar to those already present in the needle aspirate and there were many multinuclear osteoclast-like giant cells. The immunohistochemical staining confirmed the mesenchymal nature of the lesion (positivity for vimentin), but did not indicate clearly a specific histotype for the actin, CD34 and S100 protein negativity.
Preoperative examination consisted of a complete blood count, serum kidney and liver function, thyroid function test, and tests for the levels of several hormones related to the development of gynecomastia, including estrogen, testosterone, prolactin and gonadotrophic hormones as well as cancer markers (CEA, CA 15–3, CA 125). Ultrasound (US) of the abdomen failed to document any abnormalities. An isotope bone scan did not reveal any abnormal uptake. All results were within the normal limits.
The patient underwent total mastectomy without axillary lymph node dissection, awaiting histology.
Macroscopic examination of the specimen, measuring 19 × 15 × 8 cm and including the normal nipple, revealed a grayish, apparently delimited nodular lesion, measuring 10 cm in diameter, with cystic-necrotic and few hemorrhagic areas. The lesion was 0.5 cm away from the fascia and 1 cm away from the skin; furthermore, another grayish nodular lesion measuring 1.5 cm was in the subcutaneous tissue.
Microscopic examination of the sections from the specimen showed nodular proliferation of pleomorphic-spindle-shaped and ovoid cells, with connective tissue septa, mixed with many multinuclear osteoclast-like giant cells that did not show, mainly, malignant features (Figures a-b; Figure a, b).
Necrotic areas and abnormal mitosis were identified. Immunohistochemical stainings for Cytokeratin Pan (Figure a), Cytokeratin 7-8-18-19, EMA (epithelial membrane antigen), S100 protein, SMA (smooth muscle actin) and CD34 were negative; immunohistochemical staining for vimentin was positive (Figure b). Mitotic activity was observed with a high proliferation index, assessed with Ki67. Moreover, in the surrounding parenchymal component, there were multiple foci of intraductal carcinoma, evaluated with immunohistochemical staining for muscle actin and collagen IV. The lesion was contained within the margins of excision.
The histological and immunohistochemical findings established the diagnosis of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with osteoclast-like giant cells of the breast.
The patient was monitored after the operation and we did not consider that adjuvant treatment was necessary in the presence of adequate local control and in the absence of metastatic spread of the disease. Follow-up mammography has been satisfactory to date, and she remained well without tumor recurrence at 15 months.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 36-year old nulliparous female patient presented to our emergency department with acute lower abdominal pain, general discomfort, and elevated inflammatory markers. Her past medical history included obesity with a body-mass-index of 40, superficial vein thrombosis of the upper extremity and achilles tendon rupture. No bleeding abnormalities were reported. Cervical cancer screening including PAP smear was regularly performed and inconspicuous, most recently less than one year ago. On physical examination the patient presented significant rebound tenderness and involuntary guarding of the lower abdomen with a positive Blumberg sign. Speculum examination showed normal external female genitalia, normal vaginal epithelium, no abnormal discharge and a non-suspicious cervix. Significant cervical motion tenderness was observed during vaginal palpation. On vaginal ultrasound, the anteverted and anteflexed uterus showed no suspicious lesions. Bilateral adnexal masses with both cystic and solid aspects, remarkable hyperperfusion as well as free intraabdominal fluid were noted (Fig. a, b), suspicious for tubo-ovarian abscesses. During emergency laparoscopy, ruptured ovarian tumors with up to 8 cm sized cauliflower-like masses comprised of small cysts foremost of the right, but also of the left ovary were detected (Fig. a, b) and an enucleation of the cystic structures was performed.
On histopathological examination, a neoplasm with adeno-papillary growth of the inner female genital tract was described and the diagnosis of an eBOT with microinvasion of up to 1 mm was established. Following thorough postoperative discussion of the treatment options and their clinical impact, the patient decided against a fertility preserving approach favoring radical surgery including hysterectomy. Subsequently, laparoscopic staging was performed with hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, infracolic omentectomy and extensive peritoneal staging. In final histopathological results, an unexpected, HPV-high risk associated, intracervical endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the cervix uteri with a transversal diameter of 12 mm was diagnosed so that this was attributed as the primary tumor with ovarian metastases (Fig. a-f). Consistent with HPV high-risk association, the tumor showed strong immunohistochemical expression of p16 in the ovary and in the endocervix. CT scan of the thorax and abdomen showed no other distant metastases so that a subsequent laparoscopic lymph node staging was carried out to excluded tumor-infiltrated pelvic or para-aortic lymph nodes. Accordingly, final histopathological assessment led to a tumor stage of pT1b1 with ovarian metastases, pN0, L0, V0, Pn0, G2, R0, FIGO IB1. As individual decision making, an extended adjuvant treatment was applied consisting of chemoradiation followed by chemotherapy with four cycles paclitaxel and carboplatin according to the protocol of the currently recruiting OUTBACK trial (NCT01414608).","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 64-year-old man was referred to our hospital with bulging of the sternal manubrium. He was otherwise asymptomatic. There was no antecedent history of Gardner syndrome, trauma or surgery. Physical examination revealed a firm, 3× 3 cm palpable sternal mass. The contrasted computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed a 4× 4 cm mass based on the sternal manubrium, with no apparent involvement of the mediastinal structures (Figure A and B). 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) revealed metabolically active areas around the manubrium, both sternoclavicular joints, and bilateral first sternocostal joints, which was suggestive of malignant tumor of the sternal manubrium. The patient refused to undergo preoperative fine-needle aspiration of the lesion. Thus the patient underwent a radical en bloc resection of the tumor and sternal reconstruction with autogenous rib grafts. At surgery, an expansile lesion involving the entire manubrium, both sternoclavicular joints, and bilateral first sternocostal joints was found. En bloc radical manubriectomy was performed including portions of the bilateral clavicles and first ribs. The specimen was removed 4 cm beyond the margin of the lesion. Then through a left anterior lateral incision, about 10 cm of the left fifth rib was harvested from the subperiosteum and carved into two parts with preservation of intact periosteum and pleura. Slots were cut into the ends of the two rib clips, bilateral clavicles, and the edge of the sternum using an electric drill. The two rib grafts were placed to form a T shape between the edges of the residual sternum and bilateral clavicles using rib nails, and then fixed with stainless steel wires. Histopathological examination revealed long fascicles of spindle-shaped cells with slight atypia arranged in a collagenous stroma, indicating a diagnosis of desmoid tumor (Figure A and B). The resection margins did not show any signs of neoplastic infiltration. Postoperative recovery was unremarkable and there were no complications. Three months postoperatively, computed tomography scan of the reconstructed chest showed neither instability of the chest wall nor evidence of tumor recurrence (Figure C). The patient has been free of disease for 46 months after surgery without any other treatment.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 77-year-old female came to the hospital with complaints of lower abdominal pain localized particularly in the left iliac fossa. On initial examination, she was febrile (100.4°F). The abdomen was distended with ill-defined palpable mass in the left lower abdomen. The pelvic examination showed a spontaneous malodorous discharge in the vagina and cervical os. She had leukocytosis (14,500/mm3) and raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (40 mm/h).
She underwent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan which revealed a large collection adjacent to the sigmoid colon. The collection was seen abutting the uterus with air-fluid level within the uterine cavity []. Based on CT findings, possibility of sigmoid diverticular abscess and colouterine fistula was considered. The patient underwent abscess drainage, hysterectomy, and colostomy. About 2 cm defect was noted in the posterior uterine wall communicating with the abscess and sigmoid colon. The patient improved clinically following surgery.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 42-year-old man presented with sudden abdominal pain and hematochezia for one day. He had a past history of splenoectomy three years prior for traffic injury. He was alcoholic and was once diagnosed as alcoholic cirrhosis. On admission, he was hypotensive at 91/60 mm Hg, and tachycardia with a pulse of 118 beats/min. Upon physical examination, he was found to have a distended abdomen and slight tenderness in periumbilical region, and the shifting dullness sign were noted. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed liver cirrhosis, massive ascite. Apart from slightly decreased hemoglobin 11.6g/dL, all other laboratory examinations were unremarkable. He was admitted to gastroenterology ward under the diagnosis of bleeding esophageal varices or peptic ulcer and decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites.
After his admission, he complained of a progressive distending abdomen and underwent a paracentesis which showed a bloody ascite. Another check of hemoglobin decreased to 8.9 g/dL and an urgent contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated giant hematoma in lesser sac and peri-pancreatic space. Subsequently, he underwent emergency laparotomy and two liters of blood and was found in the abdomen. Severe adhesions were encountered in the peritoneal cavity. Following a careful dissection of severely adhered tissues and removal of clots, blood was suspected to be oozing from the gastric coronary vein, which was sutured subsequently and the patient was sent to intensive care unit. From then on, hemoglobin fluctuated around 11.5 g/dL in the following 66 hrs, followed by a sudden decrease to 9.6 g/dL and 7.5 g/dL on 4th day postoperation. Bedside ultrasonography and contrast-enhance CT demonstrated hematoma again in lesser sac and peri-pancreatic space. Therefore, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of celiac and superior mesenteric arteries were performed which showed a 2-cm-diameter saccular aneurysm that arised from the middle-distal splenic artery. The aneurysm disappeared after embolization with multiple coils placed in splenic artery segments proximal and distal to the aneurysmal neck (). Unfortunately, the patient underwent a second laparotomy because of his hemoglobin kept dropping. After careful clean of 1000 ml blood and clots, a ruptured and bleeding SAA was found to be tightly adhensive to the neighbouring posterior wall of the stomach. Partial pancreatectomy involving pancreatic tail and aneurysm resection, and gastric suture were performed, after which the patient had an unremarkable recovery and was discharged 20 days later.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 46-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension presented to our trauma bay with complex injuries of the right nose and midface, which included an amputated nose, upper lip and right eyebrow approximately 40 minutes after an assault including numerous human bite wounds. His right ala, right sidewall, and right upper lip were entirely missing, with nasal airways on each side visible. The amputated specimens included nasal tissue which measured approximately 4.0 x 4.0 cm, the eyebrow 2.0 x 2.0 cm, and the upper lip 1.0 x 11.7 cm (Figure ). After rapid sequence intubation, assessment, and stabilization, the patient was taken to the operating room about one hour after the initial presentation for reattachment and wound reconstruction.
In the OR, the superior labial artery and a small outflow vein, which was likely part of the superior labial venous plexus, were identified and isolated from the lateral portion of the lip. However, the nasal segment contained no identifiable viable artery or vein. Therefore, the nasal and eyebrow portions were replanted similarly to full thickness skin grafts and the upper lip was replanted using microvascular techniques. The segments of each vessel were flushed with heparinized saline. Then, the superior labial artery was anastomosed using 9-0 nylon interrupted sutures, followed by anastomosis of the vein using 9-0 nylon. After three hours and 19 minutes of operating time, arterial blood flow was immediately apparent, but venous flow was not definitive. The wounds of the upper eyelid and right cheek were debrided and then closed.
To improve the chance of tissue survival, our patient was scheduled to receive hyperbaric oxygen treatment within 24 hours post-operation. However, the patient reported that his ears could not tolerate the pressure and therapy was postponed until otolaryngology could insert tubes at the bedside. Additionally, he was receiving 30 mg of enoxaparin daily to mitigate the chance of outflow venous thrombosis. The replaced nasal and eyebrow tissue and the microsurgically replanted upper lip appeared to have some minor ischemia at the lateral margins (particularly of the nasal tip) that would most likely require revision, but the majority of the three portions appeared healthy (Figure ).
Later that day, the patient reported upper extremity numbness. After a non-contrast CT showed no intracranial abnormality, he received 8.34 mg bolus of tPA followed by 75.1 mg of IV tPA over the course of an hour for possible ischemic stroke. Subsequent MRI showed a small acute left frontal cortical infarction. The next morning the patient reported chest discomfort and an EKG showed ST-segment elevation of inferior leads with elevated troponin peak of 132.2 due to myocardial infarction. The patient then underwent left heart catheterization that showed adequate flow and no need for further intervention. After these events, he received 30 mg of enoxaparin twice a day per protocol.
After tPA treatment, there was marked continuous sanguineous discharge from the replant sites and the eyebrow, nose, and upper lip began to appear increasingly dusky. Our patient was determined to be a high-risk candidate for immediate revision surgery and plans for secondary reconstruction were made. The patient returned six days later for facial wound debridement of necrotic wounds of the upper lip, nose, and right forehead with subsequent placement of Integra artificial dermis (Figure ). He subsequently underwent nose and upper lip advancement flaps to save oral competence. A month later, nasal reconstruction was undertaken with a left paramedian forehead flap and full-thickness skin graft to upper lip and nose. The second stage of reconstruction was done one month later including the second stage of the paramedian flap, ear cartilage graft to the nose, and full-thickness skin graft of the upper lip (Figure ). Subsequent reconstruction one month later included an Abbe flap from the lower lip to the upper lip and final revision of the forehead flap. Overall, our patient was satisfied with the cosmetic and functional outcome of his reconstruction four months after his final surgery (Figure ).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"We evaluated a 4 years old girl, previously healthy, with no relevant family medical history. She was conducted to our clinic because of a submandibular lymphadenitis. A month before, during a 3 days fever period, a painful submandibular swelling was noted. Neck ultrasound (US) showed a 2-cm diameter lymphadenopathy with a conserved structure. Therapy with ibuprofen was then suggested. Because of symptoms persistence, a control US was repeated after 5 days. The lymph node was enlarged and presented a subverted structure, with hypoechogenic areas and an absent roundness index (Fig. ). Therapy with co-amoxiclav was immediately started at a dosage of 80 mg/kg/day for 6 days. Blood tests showed a slight increase in C-reactive protein values (53 mg/L; normal value <50 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (31 mm/h); serology for Cytomegalovirus confirmed a previous infection, while IgM for Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) were positive. Blood smear was normal. Tuberculin skin test resulted positive (10 mm infiltration diameter). QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-tube test and chest X-ray resulted negative.
Neck US performed after 20 days was unchanged. Therefore the girl was referred to our infectious disease unit for further investigations. At physical examination, a fixed right submandibular lymphadenopathy, with an elastic consistency, painless and with no superficial skin alterations was detected. No other significant clinical features were described. Blood tests showed no alteration in blood count, inflammatory markers, liver function, lactic dehydrogenase, coagulation. Francisella tularensis and Toxoplasma gondii serology were negative. EBV serology showed evidence of a past infection.
In the suspicion of an NTM lymphadenitis, antimicrobial therapy with clarithromycin (15 mg/kg/die), and rifampicin (20 mg/kg per day) was started. A magnetic resonance imaging showed a confluent lymphonodal pack inside the inferior pole of the right parotid gland (4 × 4.2 × 2.9 cm) that was enhanced after contrast medium infusion. The enhancement involved also the whole parotid gland parenchyma and the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid muscle.
Due to sudden enlargement of swelling, exeresis of the lymph node was performed. Bacterioscopic exam showed a positivity for acid-fast bacilli, and the histological examination evidenced a granulomatous inflammation. Culture from the biopsy grew a M. marseillense strain, identified using a commercial kit (Hain Genotype Mycobacteria CM, Hain Lifescience, Germany) and sequencing the spacer region interposed between 16S and 23S rRNA genes, as described previously []. Because of a slow healing up of the surgical scar, ethambutol (25 mg/kg/die) was added to the previous therapy. Antimicrobial treatment was well tolerated by the patient and no adverse effect were reported. Blood exams and clinical assessment were periodically performed in order to evaluate potential drug-induced toxicity. Therapy was finally stopped 2 months after surgery.
Periodical blood tests and neck US were performed. At 10 months follow up visit, no relapse was found and the surgical scar was completely healed.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"Our patient is an 8-year-old girl, with a positive family history for both skeletal malformations and bipolar disorders (BD). Her pre-perinatal history was uneventful. She was referred to our Unit because of learning difficulties and behavioural problems. The neurological examination did not show focal neurological deficits. Dysmorphic features were evident at the first observation. She showed several facial dimorphisms such as flat face, blepharophimosis, hypertelorism, broad nasal bridge, and high palate. Bones and joints defects were also evident: pectum excavatum, single transverse palmar crease, brachydactyly, flat foot, and stature below 25th percentile (). Because of these features, she previously underwent genetic consultation and performed array-CGH analysis revealing a chromosomic 8q22.1-q22.3 duplication (hg19/96.846.254-101.630.576x3, 101.726.279x2) encompassing the GDF6 and SDC2 genes, inherited from her father. Thus, our 8-year-old girl presented with clinical and genetic features of Leri's pleonosteosis, within a larger microduplication involving different genes not strictly related to our patient phenotype. In particular, the hypothesis of autosomal recessive optic atrophy (OPA6) was excluded by a general ophthalmologic examination and a fundus examination, since the contiguous region 8q21.13-q22.1 is responsible for recessive optic atrophy [].
She also met the DSM-5 criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), specific learning disorder, speech sound disorder, and developmental coordination disorder. In particular, she showed a highly pressured pattern of speech, difficulty in sustaining attention, high levels of activity, and low frustration tolerance. Furthermore, she presented a pattern of bipolar-like phenomena that did not meet the criteria for bipolar I, bipolar II, or cyclothymic disorder. Nevertheless, according to DSM-5 category, she met the criteria for the diagnosis of “other specified bipolar and related disorder” owing to the occurrence of hypomania episode without prior major depressive episode or a manic episode.
The clinical features are shared with both her father and her grandfather that present an overlapping duplication in the 8q22.1-q22.3 region. They show facial dimorphism (flat face, blepharophimosis, hypertelorism, and broad nasal bridge) and brachydactyly and are affected, respectively, by cyclothymic disorder and bipolar II disorder. Also her grandfather's brother received a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder. Unfortunately, he has never performed an array-CGH analysis, but he shows skeletal malformations consistent with Leri's disorder. Along paternal line of our patient, more members are affected by mood disorders associated with skeletal deformations. Unfortunately, none of them agreed to perform the array-CGH analysis, thus the information is incomplete to build a family tree chart. Nevertheless, the chromosome 8q22.1 microduplications were documented in our patient and his father and grandfather.
Our 8-year-old girl's developmental milestones had been mildly delayed. In particular, she presented a delayed achievement of the expressive language. Thus she started a speech-language therapy when she was 4-year-old and continued it for two years. During infancy, she also presented a divergent strabismus surgically treated at the age of 3 years. She also had genu recurvatum and hip developmental dysplasia (type-II Graf) within the first year of life. Our first neurological examination failed to detect major focal signs, but gross and fine coordination impairments with orofacial dyspraxia and speech phonological deficits were observed.
The behavioural observation revealed high levels of impulsivity and a persistently elated mood with increased activity and energy for most of the day. She often displayed restlessness, hyperactivity, and difficulty remaining focused. She also was more talkative than usual and prone to engage conversations with strangers in public, with an indiscriminately friendly approach and a high level of enthusiasm. On the whole, her social behaviour towards adults was often inappropriate. Furthermore, the conversation content appeared inappropriate to the contest with flight of ideas and abrupt shifts from one topic to another. She also showed amusing irrelevancies and theatrical mannerisms and an inflated self-esteem with uncritical self-confidence. Moreover, rapid shifts in mood over brief periods of time might occur. During these episodes, her mood became irritable and she presented decreased need for sleep, diminished ability to concentrate, inconclusiveness, and angry bursts when her wishes were denied.
The neuropsychological assessment included the cognitive profile (WISC IV) [], visual perception and motor coordination (VMI) [], executive functions (TOL) [], and verbal and spatial memory (Corsi test) []. The IQ score was in the low average (total IQ score 88), with the lowest score in nonverbal and fluid reasoning (perceptual reasoning index = 80). A moderate impairment was revealed in visuospatial short-term working memory (Corsi backward span = 2; −1.89 SD) and in backward verbal span (digit backward span = 2; −1.29 SD). Planning ability was largely below the average (rule violations = T > 100, >−2 SD; number of additional moves = T > 100, >−2 SD, TOL), suggesting a poor mental planning and problem-solving skills. She also showed deficits in visual perception and motor coordination skills at the visual-motor integration test (VMI Beery, 1997; standard score = 78; 7th percentile). The reading and writing tests scored below the average (oral reading speed of a text: 0.88 syllables/seconds/−2 DS; number of errors = 14/5° percentile; writing errors: −2 DS). She lacked knowledge of spelling rules that made her enable to read and write complex words. In general, she showed difficulties in managing the aspect of phonological processing which underpins the acquisition of literacy. Working out meaning from a whole sentence was another of her weaknesses due to the working memory deficit. Instead, when dealing with words in isolation, she had less difficulty in comprehension. She also showed very low concentration and attention abilities. During the assessment, she had to be constantly refocused and prompted to continue. All in all, our patient's neurodevelopment and psychiatric symptoms caused a marked impairment, especially in social relationship and in academic performance.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 50-year-old Korean man presented with a keloid scar on his anterior chest wall, which had developed 1 year prior following trauma and had gradually enlarged beyond the original wound's boundaries. He complained about pain and itching sensations in the keloid scar. The keloid scar measured about 5 cm and was located on the sternal area; a cystic lesion with a pin-point-sized skin opening was present at the center of the keloid scar (Fig. A). The cystic lesion was absent before the traumatic event, and dermoscopic examination revealed an EC with a central skin opening (Fig. B). The patient was asked to choose which among the 2 treatment options to undergo: total excision of the scar tissue including the cyst or laser therapy for the keloid and cystic lesion; the patient chose the latter method. First, laser therapy using a 595-nm pulsed dye laser (Vbeam; Candela Corporation, Wayland, MA) with a 7-mm spot size at a fluency of 12 J/cm2 and a 20-ms pulse width was performed to manage the keloid scar. Adjacent, nonoverlapping laser pulses were applied to the entire surface of the keloid scar. Epidermal cooling was achieved using a cryogen spray cooling device, which had a spurt duration of 30 ms with a delay of 30 ms. These procedures were performed 3 times with 3-week intervals. Second, laser therapy using a carbon dioxide laser (Spectra SP carbon dioxide laser, 20 Hz, 250 μs pulse width, 17 mJ; Lutronic, Korea) to create multiple punctures, resulting in a 2 to 4 mm hole, was performed to manage the EC. Gentle pressure and squeezing led to the exudation of the cyst's internal contents through the hole, and the remaining visible cystic walls were cauterized using the carbon dioxide laser. We applied Steri-Strip skin closures (3 M, Maplewood, MN) to the wound without surgical sutures. There were no postoperative complications, such as infection or wound dehiscence. The EC healed completely following the carbon dioxide laser therapy. We performed 5 further pulsed dye laser cycles on the whole keloid scar (Fig. C and D). After completing the laser therapy, Mepiform dressing (Mölnlycke Health Care, Oakville, Ontario, Canada), which is a self-adherent soft silicone dressing designed for scar management, was used by the patient for 5 months (Fig. E and F). There were no EC recurrences or keloid overgrowth during the 2-year follow-up period, and the patient was satisfied with the final outcome (Fig. G).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"The patient was a previously healthy 73-year-old female who underwent curative resection for GBC (pT2N0M0 according to the eighth International union against cancer TNM classification). We performed next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based genomic profiling of the resected specimen using the NGS gene panel, Oncomine® Comprehensive Assay version 3 (OCA v.3, Thermo Fisher Scientific), which revealed ERBB2 Ser310Phe (c.929C>T; VAF, 18%) and TP53 Ser241Tyr (c.722C>A; VAF, 19%) mutations. One year later, a hepatic lesion was observed on follow-up imaging and she underwent surgical total biopsy for a pathological diagnosis.
A patient had no symptoms and was in good health at the time of total biopsy.
The patient had no previous medical history.
The patient’s physical examination was not remarkable and laboratory testing was within normal limits, including tumor markers, such as CA19-9 and CEA.
Contrasted computed tomography (CT) showed an ill-defined low attenuation lesion in the posterior lobe of the liver (Figure ).
The hepatic lesion was histologically diagnosed as well-differentiated adenocarcinoma and the histological findings of the hepatic lesion were similar to those of GBC (Figure ). Therefore, the lesion was considered a metastasis. Moreover, we performed genomic profiling from the liver tumor using the NGS panel, Oncomine® Target Test system (OTT, Thermo Fisher Scientific). This revealed ERBB2 Ser310Phe (c.929C>T; VAF, 26%), which was identical to the mutation detected in the sequencing result of the primary site; thus, the liver tumor was the most consistent with a metastasis of GBC rather than localized ICC. To evaluate HER2 overexpression in tumor cells, we performed immunohistochemistry of HER2, which was negative (HER2 score 0). Since TP53 was not included in the gene list of OTTs, TP53 mutation status at the metastatic site was not assessed.
The final diagnosis of the presented case is hepatic recurrence of GBC.
After the total biopsy of liver metastasis, she was treated with two standard chemotherapy regimens, namely gemcitabine and cisplatin, and TS-1; however, her disease did not obtain clinical benefit from these treatments. After six months from hepatic resection, she was confirmed to have a progressive disease during second-line chemotherapy. At that time, she had liver and pulmonary recurrence, as well as pulmonary and inferior vena cava tumor embolism, which caused tachycardia and peripheral edema.
Considering no standard treatment beyond second-line for GBC, we treated the patient with lapatinib with a combination of capecitabine (lapatinib at a dose of 1250 mg per day continuously plus capecitabine at a dose of 2000 mg per square meter of body-surface area on days 1 through 14 of a 21 d cycle) based on the accumulating preclinical and clinical evidence that tumors with ERBB2 mutation benefit from HER2-targeted treatment.
Within a week of treatment, she experienced major subjective clinical improvement, which included resolution of peripheral edema. After 2 cycles of treatment, contrasted CT imaging showed a decrease in the size of tumor emboli and hepatic lesions (Figure ). However, after 4 cycles of treatment, the patient discontinued treatment due to grade 3 mucositis. Mucositis was gradually subsided over two weeks after discontinuation of the treatment. One month after discontinuation, her disease progressed, and she chose best supportive care.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 40-year-old woman originally from Ecuador was referred to our institution for evaluation of progressive dyspnea on exertion. Two months prior to her presentation, she was treated at an outside hospital for presumed community acquired pneumonia with symptoms of dyspnea on exertion, fevers, chills, and productive cough. After not seeing measurable improvement, the patient then presented to the emergency department at another institution where a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed that the patient had a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology and a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60%. Pericardiocentesis was performed with 700 cc of fluid removed, which grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). The patient's purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test was positive. The patient was started on anti-TB therapy and discharged.
She continued to complain of persistent dyspnea on exertion and thus was referred to our institution for a repeat of TTE at the outpatient cardiac diagnostic center. TTE revealed the rare presystolic flow through pulmonic valve, excessive variation in the mitral valve and aortic valve spectral Doppler velocities, and markedly thickened pericardium (Figures –), consistent with constriction []. The study also demonstrated septal bounce, small pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion. The patient was admitted for further evaluation. On admission, the patient's vital signs showed a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, a blood pressure of 108/70, a heart rate of 117, and respiratory rate of 20 with an oxygen saturation of 99% in room air. Her exam revealed a young woman in mild distress with 11 cm internal jugular vein distension, decreased breath sounds at lung bases bilaterally and scant bibasilar crackles, regular tachycardia, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Her BNP was 124, CRP was 5.1, and WBC count was 5.9 with a normal differential. Her complete metabolic panel was unremarkable. The patient underwent a left and right heart catheterization due to the suspicion of constrictive pericarditis. A coronary angiogram demonstrated no obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease. The right heart catheterization revealed elevated right atrial pressure, right ventricular end diastolic pressure, and an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Simultaneous right and left ventricular pressure tracings demonstrated discordant respiratory variation consistent with constrictive pericarditis. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her chest with contrast confirmed marked thickening of both the parietal and pleural pericardial surfaces, measuring up to 13.4 mm in thickness, and a large right-sided pleural effusion (Figures and ). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast showed diffuse pericardial thickening (), which showed intense delayed gadolinium contrast enhancement () that did not involve the myocardium. Additionally, there was a greater interventricular septal bounce during diastole and inspiration, consistent with chronic inflammatory constrictive pericarditis.
Due to her worsening symptoms and diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis, she was referred to cardiothoracic surgery at our institution for pericardiectomy. The surgery was without incident and the surgical samples were sent for pathology. While being negative for AFB by concentrated smear and culture, the stripped pericardium showed noncaseating granulomas, extensive fibrosis, and severe lymphohistiocytic infiltrate.
In the immediate postoperative period, the patient began to develop signs and symptoms of central volume overload, heart failure, and hypotension. An electrocardiogram (ECG) at this time showed sinus tachycardia with nonspecific ST-T abnormalities with poor R wave progression, new from prior ECGs. A subsequent TTE on postoperative day one showed significant changes from the prior study, with severely decreased biventricular dysfunction. The LVEF was severely depressed at 26%, with early evidence of elevated filling pressure within the left ventricle, indicated by the time difference between pulmonary vein (Ar) duration and mitral A-wave duration (Ar-A) of positive 46 ms. For the right ventricle, fractional area change (FAC) was abnormally low at 29%, with reduced tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) distance of 0.96 cm. There was also moderate tricuspid regurgitation, enlarged right atrium (area 27 cm2), and moderately elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 41 mmHg. There was akinesis of the entire apical and midventricular segments of both the right and left ventricles (Figures –) with hypercontractile base. Findings were consistent with stress cardiomyopathy.
While in critical condition postoperatively, the patient had episodes of atrial fibrillation and atrial tachycardia, for which she was chemically cardioverted with intravenous amiodarone, with subsequent conversion to sinus rhythm. Initially, the patient required multiple vasopressors and inotropes (epinephrine, norepinephrine, milrinone, and dopamine drip) to maintain her blood pressure and cardiac output, while gentle diuresis was achieved carefully for the symptoms of heart failure. Once the patient was hemodynamically stable, she was placed on appropriate oral medical therapy, including carvedilol and furosemide, followed by gradual clinical improvement and was able to be discharged on postoperative day 10. Due to decreased urine output and hypotension, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker was not initiated at the time. A posthospital TTE 7 weeks after discharge showed normalized function of both the right and left ventricles (Figures –).","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 64-year-old woman experienced gradual visual loss for several months prior to her first examination. The woman had a 15-year history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In addition, she suffered from hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sleep apnea, and a sense of unsteadiness, which had worsened during the last months. She was on several medications (aspirin, omeprazole, simvastatin, atenolol, ramipril, amlodipine, albuterol inhalation, budenoside, and formoterol inhalation). She negated eye pain. BCVA was 0.8 in both eyes. Both visual fields exhibited temporal defects (Humphrey field test). A fundus examination showed peripapillary atrophy in both eyes, but no sign of edema. An MRI with and without intravenous contrast performed 1 week later revealed an increased volume of fluid surrounding both optical nerves as well as increased signal intensity in the optical nerve sheaths, as seen in OPN. The MRI also showed increased signaling in the retrobulbar fat of the left eye and possible subcortical vasculitis. At a consultation, 1 week after the first visit, BCVA was unchanged since the last visit. Laboratory testing was done for sarcoidosis (ACE), syphilis (WR, VDRL), and neuromyelitis optica (NMO). In addition, ESR, CRP, HGB, and blood count were determined. Results showed a high or abnormal ESR, serum lysozyme, polyclonal IgG, and creatinine. Results for NMO antibodies, syphilis, and sarcoidosis markers were normal or negative. A chest X-ray did not find any sign of sarcoidosis. However, a slightly enlarged heart was observed, suggesting a developing heart failure. The woman was later administered intravenous corticosteroids (1 g ×2) and cyclophosphamide to treat her SLE. Shortly after, the woman was hospitalized due to cardiac arrhythmia. Warfarin and digoxin were prescribed, and the woman was discharged from the hospital some days later. Because of her arrhythmia, future treatment with corticosteroids was restricted.
At a new examination 3 months after her first visit, BCVA was unchanged. Results from eye field tests were still abnormal, with no certain change since the last examination. An SST color vision test showed more defective color vision in the left eye (80 p), compared to the right (30 p). Fundus examination showed no optic disc edema in either eye.
At a new consultation 2 months later, BCVA was still unchanged at 0.8 in both eyes. She was on prednisone (5mg/day) in addition to methotrexate (5 mg/week) and levetiracetam, which had been prescribed since her last visit. A fundus examination revealed peripapillary atrophy, but no signs of disc edema in either the left or the right eye. Visual field tests were abnormal (Humphrey field test, VFI was 61% in right eye and 71% in left eye). One month later, she was given injections of rituximab.
At the final eye examination 10 months after her first visit, BCVA was 0.8/0.65. A slight improvement of visual test results was observed (Humphrey field test, VFI was 83% in right eye and 74% in left eye). As noted previously, color vision was more defective in the left eye (35 p) compared to the right (20 p), although some improvement was seen since the last examination.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 67-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 10-day history of left-sided testicular pain. Symptoms were of gradual onset, and were initially treated with antibiotics from his general practitioner. There was no history of trauma, injury, pyrexia or voiding symptoms. Urine dipstick test was negative.
Examination revealed an acutely tender left groin and left testicle with a markedly enlarged, erythematous left hemi-scrotum. Antibiotics were changed to doxycycline from ciprofloxacin, and the patient was referred for an urgent ultrasound which was performed the following day. Full blood count revealed white cell count of 8.2×109/L with a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 48 mg/L. All other blood tests were normal.
An ultrasound scan revealed no vascularity within the left testicle. The patient was taken for scrotal exploration under general anaesthetic. This revealed a torted left testicle with no pus present. A left orchidectomy was performed along with right-sided testicular fixation. The patient had an uneventful post-operative course, and was discharged home the following day.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 32-year-old Caucasian man from Switzerland was referred for further evaluation of an elevated serum ferritin, the test for which was ordered because of tiredness. His serum ferritin concentration at presentation was markedly elevated at 1314 μg/L (normal range 30-400 μg/L), but the serum transferrin saturation of 23.3% was within our laboratory reference interval (normal range 15-50%).
Our patient had no history of alcohol abuse or other metabolic diseases and no family history of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). Clinical examination revealed no abnormalities. Further laboratory evaluation showed normal liver enzymes and normal hematological parameters.
Genetic tests for HH showed a heterozygous H63D substitution in the HFE gene but wild-type sequence at the HFE C282Y locus. The histology of a liver biopsy specimen was normal, and did not show iron accumulation or steatosis. Together, these findings exclude a diagnosis of HH.
Upon further evaluation, our patient revealed a history of bilateral cataracts at four years of age. His mother, his maternal aunt and maternal grandfather had all had nuclear cataracts at an early age (Figure ). Slit-lamp examination, direct illumination and retro-illumination of his lenses showed scattered, radially oriented flecks and crystalline deposits in both lenses (Figure ). Sequencing of the FTL gene using a previously described method [] showed a heterozygous c.33 C > A transversion in the IRE within the FTL 5'UTR. This mutation has been previously associated with the HHCS phenotype [].","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 44-year-old, right-handed female presented with sudden hand motor deficits in her left hand. There was no trauma to the arm, she used no medications and she had no vascular risk factors.
Examination revealed severe motor deficits of the left hand with extension of the three ulnar fingers and wrist, muscle atrophy in the first dorsal interosseous muscle, and claw hand deformity without sensory deficits (Fig. ). According to the Medical Research Council scale examination revealed grade 1 in the left wrist flexor, grade 4 in the left wrist extensor, grade 3 in the left fingers flexor and grade 4 in the left fingers extensor. Adduction and abduction of the left fingers were also severely impaired (grade 3). Deep tendon reflexes were mildly brisker ipsilateral to the affected hand. No Babinski sign was observed.
Cervical computed tomography (CT) was unremarkable. Peripheral motor nerve conduction velocities were normal. Small, discrete ischemic lesions appeared hyperintense on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence (upper arrows on Fig. ). The infarct was located in the right posterior part of the precentral hand knob area (upper arrow on 1d), near the central sulcus (lower arrow on Fig. ). CT angiography showed significant stenosis in the right proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) trunk.
Transesophageal echocardiogram and carotid ultrasound did not suggest an embolic source. Hypercoagulable screening and levels of markers specific to systemic vasculitis were all normal. An embolism arising from the ipsilateral MCA stenosis was subsequently considered as the etiology of the patient’s symptoms, and she received acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel for secondary stroke prevention.
At the 2-month follow-up, the patient complained of fatigue and progressive headaches. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. Follow-up 3-Tesla MRI with gadolinium contrast revealed focal wall enhancement in the right proximal MCA (Fig. ), indicating cerebral angiitis. Multiple stenoses at the same location were seen on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) (Fig. ). Brain biopsy was not performed.
Cyclophosphamide infusions were administered with glucocorticoids over the subsequent 15 weeks. Left-hand motor function improved, aside from her left fifth finger.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 51-year-old man with known mild, bilateral nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy was referred for evaluation of CRAO that had developed in his left eye 72 hours prior to presentation. His past medical history included systemic arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years.
On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 0.6 in the right eye and hand motion in the left eye. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 14 mmHg bilaterally by Goldmann applanation tonometry. Anterior segment evaluation showed no NVI in the left eye, and both eyes had open angles. Fundus examination showed midperipheral retinal hemorrhages in both eyes. In the left eye, the retina was pale with attenuated arteries and a cherry red spot at the posterior pole. An intravenous fluorescein angiogram showed a delayed arm-to-retina time of 25 seconds and incomplete retinal venous filling throughout the test (>6 minutes). Choroidal perfusion was normal. Noninvasive carotid examination delineated 70% stenosis in the left proximal internal carotid artery and plaques in both internal carotid arteries.
Five weeks later, on routine follow-up examination, he returned complaining of ocular pain in his left eye for the previous three days. The visual acuity in the left eye had decreased to no light perception, and the IOP was 45 mmHg. Neovascularization of the iris and angle was noted in the left eye. The retinal whitening and cherry red spot were still present.
Despite maximal tolerable medical therapy to control intraocular pressure, the patient experienced marked discomfort. Treatment options were explained in detail, and after the patient gave consent, an intravitreal injection of 0.75 mg (0.03 ml) of bevacizumab was performed in a sterile fashion without anterior chamber paracentesis. One week later, there was a complete regression of the NVI, and the IOP had decreased to 25 mmHg with two topical antiglaucoma medications (dorzolamide/timolol fixed combination and brimonidine). PRP consisting of a total of 1200 burns was administered in three sessions starting two weeks after the injection. Over the next three months, recurrent NVI developed, and the patient received another IVB injection and additional PRP. Over the course of treatment, the patient received 2000 burns in all. Two months after the additional combination therapy, there was no recurrence of NVI, and the IOP was 21 mmHg with the same medications.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 52-year-old female presented with a sudden onset of right-sided numbness and weakness that was accompanied by a left temporal cluster-like headache. No fever or prodromal infection was found at disease onset.
The family and personal history was unremarkable.
On physical examination, the height and weight of the patient were 154 cm and 56 kg, respectively. Vital signs were normal, as were heart, lung and abdominal exami-nations. Neurological examination showed intact mental status, with normal speech and comprehension. Mild 4/5 right-sided hemiparesis was present with normal tone in both the arm and leg, though no other focal neurological deficits were found. After admission, she complained of discomfort and tingling in the right leg, after which a generalized tonic-clonic seizure for 3 min occurred before it was stopped by a bolus of intravenous diazepam.
Laboratory tests, including D-dimer, lactic acid, and serum autoantibody levels, as well as thyroid function and tumor markers indicated no apparent abnormalities. Glucose tolerance and lactic acid movement tolerance tests were normal. A lumbar puncture was performed, and her open intracranial pressure was 180 mm H2O. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing showed that cell counts and protein, glucose, chloride, monoclonal antibody, adenosine deaminase, and lactate dehydrogenas levels were within normal ranges.
MRI demonstrated a lamellar left parietal lobe lesion predominantly involving the cortex, with hyperintensity on both diffusion-weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (Figure ). The apparent diffusion coefficient map revealed a preserved, isointense signal. No abnormalities were found by susceptibility weighted imaging or magnetic resonance angiography and venography (Figure ). Due to the stroke-like onset pattern and MRI features, further thrombophilia screening was performed and showed decreased protein S activity. A diagnosis of cortical venous thrombosis was first proposed. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) was also considered but temporarily excluded because of the incomplete manifestation and lack of genetic evidence. Anticoagulation therapy was initiated, and follow-up was performed to maintain the international normalized ratio (INR) within the target range.
Two months later, the patient was readmitted for subacute cognitive impairment. She was unable to identify and communicate with family members; she also had difficulty understanding questions or instructions and instead responded by repeating the word ""nothing"". During hospitalization, a secondary generalized seizure occurred, initially with eyes gazing to the right and then convulsion developing, which lasted for approximately 10 s before self-alleviation. Neurological examination suggested transcortical sensory aphasia, with fully covered limb strength. Blood tests and CSF examination were normal; INR was 2.21. On repeated MRI, new lesions were identified in the left temporal lobe and were also detected 10 days later in the right temporal lobe on radiological follow-up (Figures and ). Although the MRI signal characteristics are consistent with the initial findings, the original lesion in the left parietal lobe had been alleviated, with cortical atrophy. We further conducted magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), which revealed markedly elevated lactate (Lac) concentrations in the regions of interest in the left temporal lesion (Figure ). Mitochondrial encephalopathy was diagnosed, and genetic testing using peripheral blood was performed. However, DNA testing for frequent MELAS and myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers syndrome mutations were negative. Because of the lack of symptoms of muscle weakness or pain, the patient declined our suggestion of performing a muscle biopsy. Anticoagulation therapy was terminated, and levetiracetam (1000 mg/d) was administered.
At 3 mo after her second admission, the patient was experiencing involuntary movement in her left limbs, with repetitive flexion/extension. An MRI scan showed a hyperintense signal abnormality in the right parietal lobe (Figure ). Brachial biceps biopsy was performed. Histopathology revealed no abnormalities, and no necrotic or regenerating fibers were observed; ragged-red fibers and intense succinate dehydrogenase activity were not detected. Nonetheless, complete sequencing of mitochondrial DNA samples extracted from the biopsied muscle revealed a heteroplasmic m.10158T>C mutation, with a heteroplasmy level of 69.6%, in the mitochondrial complex I subunit gene MT-ND3. In contrast, this mutation was not found in her peripheral blood cells.
The diagnosis was MELAS syndrome harboring the m.10158T>C mutation.
We administered levetiracetam (1000 mg/d) and oxcarbazepine (400 mg/d) to control epilepsy. Q10 and L-arginine were also administered.
Over the next 6 mo, the present patient did not manifest any further stroke-like episodes.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"An 18-year-old young woman presented with 6 months amenorrhea. Menarche had occurred at age 11 years. She suffered from mild cerebral palsy (possibly due to low birth weight of 1.88 kg at 38 weeks’ gestation), mild asthma, Asperger’s syndrome, anxiety, and epileptic events from age 14 to 15 years, considered secondary to cerebral palsy. She had a ruptured appendix at age 12 years. There was no other significant past history; no drug usage; she did not smoke or drink alcohol, and had not become sexually active. Sertraline was used for treatment of anxiety from 2009 to 2010 followed by fluoxetine. There was a family history of osteoarthritis and osteopenia and of pancreatic cancer; no family history of premature menopause. The OCP was commenced at age 12 years. The attending gynecologist recorded “although her periods were reasonably normal, she was put on the pill (20 µg ethinyloestradiol and 100 µg levonorgestrol) the next year because coping with her periods made her anxiety and depression symptoms worse.” Her first HPV4 vaccination was administered at age 12 years and 9 months; the second vaccination near her 13th birthday, and the third vaccination at age 13 years and 5 months. The first HPV4 vaccination was given concomitantly with hepatitis B vaccination in the other arm. OCP usage continued for 2 years to age 14 years. It was briefly ceased at age 14 and this was followed by 3 months amenorrhea. OCP was then resumed without further investigation. At age 18 years, the OCP was again ceased and amenorrhea again ensued.
Follicle-stimulating hormone 1 month later was elevated at 44.5 IU/L (menopausal range is 25-130 IU/L). Luteinizing hormone was 29.2 IU/L (basal range 2.0-12, midcycle peak range 8.0-90, postmenopausal range 5.0-62 IU/L). Estradiol was 157 pmol/L. She continued amenorrheic and presented again for investigation 6 months later. At this time, follicle-stimulating hormone remained elevated at 34 IU/L. Luteinizing hormone was elevated at 46 IU/L. Estrodiol (Oest2) was 413 pmol/L and progesterone 2 nmol/L. Anti-Müllerian hormone was 1.5 pmol/L (14.0-30.0 pmol/L normal; levels <14 pmol/L suggest diminished ovulatory reserve) tested by Beckman Coulter Gen II ELISA assay. Anti-Müllerian hormone repeated 6 months later was <1 pmol/L and estradiol was <37 pmol/L. At this time and at age 18 years POI was diagnosed.
Full blood count, iron levels, liver function, blood glucose, and renal function were normal. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was normal 0.4 mIU/L (normal 0.3-3.5 mIU/L) and thyroid antibodies were normal. Prolactin was normal 294 mIU/L. Testosterone 0.9 nmol/L (normal 0.2-1.8 nmol/L); free androgen index 2.6 (normal 0.3-4.0); iron studies were normal. There were no antiadrenal or antiovarian antibodies detected. Morning cortisol was 218 nmol/L (normal range 160-650) nmol/L, ACTH 14 ng/L (normal range 9-51 ng/L), growth factor-1 27 nmol/L (normal range 21-76 nmol/L). Pelvic ultrasound performed at the time when the anti-Müllerian hormone level was 1.5 showed a normal uterus with an endometrial echo of 8.2 mm. Transvaginal ultrasound was declined and the left ovary was not visualized. The right ovary was 3.1 cm3 in size and there was a 9-mm follicle within it. Brief menstrual bleeds then occurred for 4 months before amenorrhea resumed.
Testing for Fragile X revealed 2 normal-sized triplet alleles 23 and 37 cytosine–guanine–guanine n repeats (the normal zone is <44). Testing for galactosemia showed a normal Gal-1-P uridyl transferase-RC at 0.31 U/g hemoglobin (normal range 0.26-0.52 U/g). Records reported a vitamin B12 deficiency at age 16 years, but levels of vitamin B12 were within normal limits at 275 pmol/L (normal range 135-650 pmol/L). Karyotype was established as 46XX.
This young woman elected to undergo right ovary cryopreservation through Monash IVF in the hope that future developments, such as stimulation of ovarian stem cells, may be of later benefit. She was not deemed a suitable candidate for gonadotropin stimulation for oocyte preservation due to the undetectable anti-Müllerian hormone level. The pathologist described the macroscopic appearance of the ovary as “cystic and disrupted.” Microscopic histology of three right ovarian biopsies reported fibrovascular connective tissue with no primordial follicles in the ovarian cortex of sample one. Ovarian sample 2 reported a cystic follicle and a cystic corpus luteum but no primordial follicles within surrounding parenchyma. Ovarian sample 3 reported “fibrofatty connective tissue only. No ovarian parenchyma is identified.” Summary: “Levels through all tissue containing ovarian parenchyma show a single primordial follicle. No other follicular structures are identified.” No samples contained evidence of atypia or malignancy (Sullivan Nicolaides Pathology. Brisbane, Queensland, Australia). Personal communication with the reporting pathologist confirmed no lymphoid or granulomatous inflammation and suggested the ovarian appearance was “consistent with that of a woman in her late forties.”
She has been counseled about bone density preservation and the need for hormone replacement therapy. This case was notified to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) of Australia in January 2014 (reference number 333136) as diagnosed POI. Its listing as “amenorrhoea” on the TGA database in May 2014 was later altered to POF (July 2014).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"The 51-year-old male patient exhibited a 10-day history of low back pain, limited waist motion and right lower limb numbness. The patient reported no pain at other sites, exhibited no fever or night sweats and was unable to recall any recent injury. The patient’s past medical history was unremarkable for trauma or other bone diseases. A physical examination demonstrated localized tenderness and percussion pain over the L4 spinous process, restricted waist motion and numbness of the right leg. Laboratory tests, including full blood cell count, serum electrolytes, renal and liver function tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), did not reveal any abnormalities. An X-ray revealed that the lesion was limited to the left lateral mass of the atlas, causing a potential instability (). Computed tomography (CT) revealed an osteolytic lesion in the right lateral mass of the L4 and accessories, accompanied by a paravertebral and intraspinal soft tissue extension (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed osteolytic destruction of the vertebral body associated with a mild compression fracture that exhibited hypointensity on T1-weighted (T1-W) images and hyperintensity on T2-weighted (T2-W) images (). On the basis of the radiological features of the lesion, there was a high possibility that the patient had a neoplastic lesion. However, the radiological features of the lesion were not sufficient to establish the diagnosis of LCH with certainty. A C-arm X-ray machine-guided needle biopsy of the vertebral body was performed and the histopathological diagnosis was LCH. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD1a and S-100 (). Further diagnostic evaluation included a bone scan, CT of the lungs, pituitary hormonal evaluation and brain CT and abdominal ultrasound evaluation. No other LCH infiltration was identified in the patient and the patient was treated as suffering from a single-system and single-site disease.
The patient underwent PVP (Stryker, Inc., Meyzieu, France) under local anesthesia in the prone position with the belly suspended in midair, under C-arm imaging guidance (). The amount of bone cement used to fill in the L4 was 3.6 ml. The blood loss during surgery was 5 ml. The spread of the cement was ideal with the exception of a small amount of paravertebral leakage of cement () which did not cause any symptoms. No complications were observed during the surgery or follow-up. After lying in bed for 6 h, the patient was able to sit freely and 24 h postoperatively, the patient was allowed to walk freely. Following the procedure, the low back pain was resolved completely and the patient’s neurological symptoms were rapidly alleviated and then gradually continued to be alleviated. The patient required the use of a weak opioid prior to the PVP but did not receive an analgesic afterwards. Notably, CT revealed a significant decrease in the paravertebral and intraspinal soft tissue extension 5 days after the PVP ().
The patient received chemotherapy following PVP. The chemotherapy regime was 100 mg etoposide (days 1–3) and 60, 40 and 20 mg prednisone (days 1–7, 8–14 and 15–21, respectively) for 3 cycles. There were no serious side-effects of the chemotherapy. CT revealed that the paravertebral and intraspinal soft tissue extension disappeared after 3 cycles (). The height of the vertebral body remained stable without further collapse and lumbar kyphosis did not occur. There was no recurrence and no other complaints over a 6-month follow-up period ().","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 65-year-old woman had been diagnosed with overlap syndrome (autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis) for 14 years. Initially, she was prescribed ursodeoxycholic acid and prednisone, and refused immunosuppressive drugs. However, due to the presence of gastric ulcer and economic reasons, she stopped taking these medications. When liver test results were abnormal, she would take compound glycyrrhizin tablets to treat the disease. In September 2013, due to hematemesis and melena, rupture and hemorrhage of the esophagofundal varices was found. Computed tomography revealed cirrhosis of the liver, splenomegaly, and ascites. The disease progressed to Child–Pugh C decompensated cirrhosis. The patient received endoscopic therapy, and began taking prescribed ursodeoxycholic acid 750 mg daily. From September 2013 to August 2015, her alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level fluctuated between 27 and 91 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase between 33 and 94 U/L, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase between 73 and 240 U/L, alkaline phosphatase between 130 and 260 U/L, total bilirubin (TBIL) between 39.3 and 74.05 mol/L, direct bilirubin between 17.6 and 34.24 mol/L, albumin between 30 and 35 g/L, antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer between 1:1000 and 1:3200, and antimitochondrial II antibody (AMA-M2) between (+) and (++). In September 2015, the patient consulted her physician in our department for significant jaundice and weakness. Physical examination revealed yellow pigmentation of the skin and sclerae, positive liver palms, spider angioma on the chest, and positive shifting dullness. Results of liver function tests showed the following: ALT, 499.9 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 686.8 U/L; albumin, 27.02 g/L; γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, 87.2 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 225.6 U/L; TBIL, 329.6 mol/L; direct bilirubin, 272.91 mol/L; cholinesterase, 2156.4 U/L; prothrombin time, 17.7 seconds; percentage prothrombin time activity, 60; and platelet count, 45 × 109/L. The anti-HCV antibody test result was positive and the quantitative HCV RNA test result was 6.1 × 105 IU/mL (genotype 1). The ANA titer was 1:3200, and the AMA-M2 was (+). Epigastric enhanced magnetic resonance imaging identified cirrhosis, splenomegaly, ascites, and collateral circulation in the esophagus, fundus of the stomach, and splenic hilum. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography did not detect any abnormality in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. Initially, the treatment included ursodeoxycholic acid at the previous dosage, glycyrrhizinate, human serum albumin, furosemide, spironolactone, lactulose oral solution, and platelet and clotting factor transfusion. However, after 1 week, weakness and jaundice were exacerbated. Liver function test results were significantly abnormal with a TBIL of 417.6 mol/L, prothrombin time of 23.5 seconds, percentage prothrombin time activity of 46, albumin of 23.1 g/L, cholinesterase of 1789.7 U/L, and platelet count of 14 × 109/L. After ruling out other possible causes of acute hepatitis, we thought that the cause of the acute exacerbation of hepatic damage was AHC infection, as liver function was decreased by HCV activity. After discussing the risks and benefits with the patient, we started her on an IFN-free combination therapy of SOF and weight-based RBV for 12 weeks. Gilead-brand SOF (400 mg/d) was used. SOF cannot be bought in China; the patient acquired the medication through her relative who works abroad. The patient was reviewed at treatment weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12 and at posttreatment weeks 4, 12, 24, and 36. At the beginning of SOF and RBV treatment, the HCV RNA viral load was 4.8 × 106 IU/mL. At week 1, the HCV RNA viral load was reduced to 4330 IU/mL; at week 2, 1790 IU/mL; and at week 3, 750 IU/mL. At weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 48 (posttreatment week 36), the HCV viral load was undetectable (Fig. ). By week 4, the patient's symptoms alleviated. By week 8, liver function returned to baseline levels with TBIL of 85.35 mol/L, prothrombin time of 17.0 seconds, albumin of 29.5 g/L, and platelet count of 53.2 × 109/L (Fig. ).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 13-year-old boy presented with sudden onset of painless blurring of vision in his both eyes. He had a history of exanthematous fever 20 days back and was treated symptomatically. There were healing skin lesions on face, abdomen and upper and lower limbs []. On examination, the un-corrected visual acuity in oculi uterque (OU) was 3/60, and best corrected visual acuity was 6/6; N-8 with − 3.00 Diopter spherical (DS) correction. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 14 and 15 mm Hg, respectively in the right and left eye. Anterior chambers (AC) were quiet and shallow, and on gonioscopy angles were open to anterior trabecular meshwork. By immersion A-scan ultrasonography AC depth (ACD) were 3.47 and 3.41 mm, and lens thickness were 3.64 mm and 3.61 mm, respectively in the right and left eye. Pupils were symmetrical, round, regular and reactive to light. Fundus examination was significant for the presence of bilateral retinal folds in the macular region bilaterally []. B scan ultrasonography showed features of annular cilliochoroidal effusion []. A dermatology opinion was taken, which pointed toward varicella, and serum was positive for the specific immunoglobulin M (1.14) antibodies. Patient was started on oral prednisone (50 mg/day) and topical homatropine 2% thrice daily.
At 1 week follow up unaided distance vision OU had improved to 6/6, and near vision was N-24. The oral prednisolone and homatropine was stopped over 2 weeks. At 4 weeks, unaided vision OU was 20/20; N-6. The AC angle was open to sclera spur on gonioscopy and fundus examination was un-remarkable.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 51-year-old man with known mild, bilateral nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy was referred for evaluation of CRAO that had developed in his left eye 72 hours prior to presentation. His past medical history included systemic arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years.
On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 0.6 in the right eye and hand motion in the left eye. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 14 mmHg bilaterally by Goldmann applanation tonometry. Anterior segment evaluation showed no NVI in the left eye, and both eyes had open angles. Fundus examination showed midperipheral retinal hemorrhages in both eyes. In the left eye, the retina was pale with attenuated arteries and a cherry red spot at the posterior pole. An intravenous fluorescein angiogram showed a delayed arm-to-retina time of 25 seconds and incomplete retinal venous filling throughout the test (>6 minutes). Choroidal perfusion was normal. Noninvasive carotid examination delineated 70% stenosis in the left proximal internal carotid artery and plaques in both internal carotid arteries.
Five weeks later, on routine follow-up examination, he returned complaining of ocular pain in his left eye for the previous three days. The visual acuity in the left eye had decreased to no light perception, and the IOP was 45 mmHg. Neovascularization of the iris and angle was noted in the left eye. The retinal whitening and cherry red spot were still present.
Despite maximal tolerable medical therapy to control intraocular pressure, the patient experienced marked discomfort. Treatment options were explained in detail, and after the patient gave consent, an intravitreal injection of 0.75 mg (0.03 ml) of bevacizumab was performed in a sterile fashion without anterior chamber paracentesis. One week later, there was a complete regression of the NVI, and the IOP had decreased to 25 mmHg with two topical antiglaucoma medications (dorzolamide/timolol fixed combination and brimonidine). PRP consisting of a total of 1200 burns was administered in three sessions starting two weeks after the injection. Over the next three months, recurrent NVI developed, and the patient received another IVB injection and additional PRP. Over the course of treatment, the patient received 2000 burns in all. Two months after the additional combination therapy, there was no recurrence of NVI, and the IOP was 21 mmHg with the same medications.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 42-year-old previously healthy male was referred to our tertiary center complaining of high-grade fever accompanied by chills over the last 20 days. He also complained of progressively increasing breathlessness, nonproductive cough, and right-sided chest pain. There was no history of weight loss or abdominal pain. He denied smoking tobacco. On arrival at our center, he was found to be febrile and dyspneic. His pulse was 120/min, respiratory rate 28/min, and SP02 was 95% at room air. The systemic examination of the chest revealed decreased breath sounds in the right lower zone and coarse crackles in the right infrascapular region. No peripheral or deep chain lymphadenopathy was detected on physical or imaging examinations. The hematological workup showed a leukocyte count of 18,000/µl (reference range [RR]; 4000-12000/μL) with 80% polymorphs. Liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. The serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 1650 U/L (RR; 150-250U/L). The chest X-ray revealed a heterogeneous opacity in the right pulmonary lower lobe and pleural effusion, which showed to be hemorrhagic after diagnostic thoracocentesis (A). The computed tomographic (CT)-guided Tru-cut biopsy attempted in the original-attending hospital showed necrotic tissue. The thoracic CT scan after the second hospitalization revealed a well-defined irregularly, marginated, complex, non-enhancing mass in the right lung, likely pleural based with thickened visceral pleura causing collapse and consolidation of the right lung (B). The radiological differentials comprised malignant mesothelioma versus a synovial sarcoma.
A new CT-guided biopsy was attempted and showed atypical cells consistent with an underlying malignant lesion (A). The thoracocentesis revealed an exudative and hemorrhagic pleural effusion without malignant cells.
Meanwhile, the patient’s clinical condition deteriorated, he became tachypneic and developed puffiness of the face and altered sensorium and a clinical diagnosis of superior vena cava obstruction was made. He was kept on an antibiotic regimen with Piperacillin-Tazobactam, corticosteroids and controlled ventilation. Bedside 2D echocardiogram failed to evidence a pericardial tamponade, but the mass was seen compressing the right atrium and superior vena cava. On the eighth day of hospitalization, his general condition suddenly worsened, and he expired. Immediately. the autopsy was performed with the working diagnosis of a right lung mass with SVC syndrome, probably due to malignant mesothelioma or a high-grade sarcoma.
External examination revealed proptosis of eyes and midline shift of trachea to the left. On the opening of the chest cavity, the right hemithorax was replaced by a massive hemorrhagic and necrotic tumor mass, which was adherent to the chest wall. In comparison, on the left side, there were 25 ml of straw-colored pleural fluid noted with pleural sheen (A). The right lung weighed 1200 g (RR; 360-570 g), and Left lung weighed 550 g (RR; 325-480 g). The right lung was replaced by a large tumor, which was chiefly necrotic, hemorrhagic, and pulpy. Only a portion of the posterior segment of the middle lobe was noted to be intact. The tumor mass pushed the trachea to the left. The left lung was boggy and was oozing frothy blood-stained fluid. The cut section did not show any cavities, abscesses, or tumor deposits (B).
The liver was enlarged and weighed 1800 g (RR:1500-1800 g). The external surface was smooth and glistening. No nodularity was noted. The cut surface showed a nutmeg appearance suggestive of passive venous congestion. No mass lesion was identified.
The spleen was enlarged, and weighed 230 g (RR:150-200 g). External and cut surface showed congestion. Both kidneys, pancreas, stomach, intestines, heart and brain were externally and on cut sections unremarkable.
Histological examination of the lung depicted tumor cells in cohesive sheets, having a peritheliomatous arrangement amidst predominantly necrotic areas. The tumor cells were round to oval, had coarsely stippled chromatin with scant to mildly eosinophilic cytoplasm. Nucleoli were inconspicuous, and mitosis was brisk. Numerous apoptotic bodies were also noted (2C).
IHC reactions showed the tumor cells to be diffusely positive for Vimentin (strong cytoplasmic positivity), CD99 (strong membranous positivity), and FLI 1(strong nuclear positivity). The tumor cells were diffusely negative for calretinin, WT1, D240, synaptophysin, CD56, TTF1, Tdt, S-100, desmin, myogenin, BCL-2, LCA, and EMA. On Periodic Schiff stain (PAS), the cytoplasm of tumor cells showed strong magenta cytoplasmic positivity (AD). Sections from the left upper and lower lobe showed normal air-filled alveoli lined by type II pneumocytes.
No tumor deposits were seen. Sections from the right and left lobe of the liver showed features of passive venous congestion. No tumor deposits were noted. Sections from the spleen showed expansion of red pulp with attenuation of the white pulp. Final diagnosis was primary Ewing sarcoma of right lung causing SVC syndrome.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 67-year-old male with known case of hypertension for 10 years on Losartan and recent onset type 2 diabetes mellitus on Metformin with reasonable blood pressure and sugar control presented with history of loss of appetite, slowness of movements, decreased memory, frequent falls, and swaying to either side while walking for the last 3 months. He also gave a history of loss of appetite associated with nausea, occasional vomiting, and easy fatiguability. For his symptoms, he was taking over the counter indigenous medication for the last 6 months. He was evaluated by a neurologist, who did not notice any significant findings on examination. His cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examination was noncontributory. Neurological examination revealed the presence of ataxia, dysmetria, dysdiadokokinesia, tremors, bradycardia, and mild rigidity. A neurological diagnosis of early Parkinsonson's disease was made and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was done, which was suggestive of a encepaholapathy. There was no evidence of ischemic changes secondary to age, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus in the MRI []. His paraneoplastic panel and autoimmune markers were not contributory. (autoimmune encephalitis mosaic antibodies and paraneoplastic neuronal antibodies were all negative.)
His initial laboratory investigations showed normal hematological parameters, normal liver function tests, normocalcemia, normal electrolytes, and normal ammonia levels. His serum creatinine was high (2.2 mg/dl). The serum creatinine done 6 months back before starting the over the counter medications was normal at 1.4 mg/dl (normal range for the lab 0.9–1.5 mg/dl). Because of his worsening renal function he was evaluated by a nephrologist also. His urine examination was normal and his protein creatinine ratio was within normal range (0.12). His ultrasound of the abdomen revealed normal sized kidneys. He underwent a renal biopsy for unexplained renal dysfunction, which showed normal glomeruli with dense interstitial infiltrate consisting of mononuclear cells and eosinophils []. The electron microscopic examination revealed toxic vacuolation of the proximal tubules []. A diagnosis of interstitial nephritis with toxic proximal tubular injury was made and as the MRI was suggestive of a toxic/metabolic encepahalopathy, investigations were done to find a putative cause. As the basic metabolic evaluation did not reveal any plausible cause, a toxicology screen was asked for. The aluminum levels were above normal in the toxicology screen []. Treatment with desferroxime chelation was advised and the indigenous medicine was stopped. One month later the aluminum levels had reduced to 29.4 μg/l and the chelation was continued for another 4 weeks. A course of 6 weeks of low dose steroids (0.5 mg/kg/day) was also given for the interstitial inflammation. Currently, the patient has a normal serum creatinine (1.3 mg/dl) with complete resolution of the neurological symptoms. The cause of cerebral symptoms were believed to be because of aluminum toxicity as the symptoms resolved completely with aluminum chelation and it is speculated that the toxic proximal tubular injury can also be attributed to aluminum.
This patient developed neurological manifestations after 3 months of starting over the counter medications. His creatinine was only checked after 6 months of continuation of the medications. The complete resolution of his neurological and kidney injury simultaneously with the reduced aluminum levels (temporal association) suggests a putative role of aluminum in this patient's illness.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 54-year-old female patient presented to our clinic with complaints of occasional pain, numbness, and paralysis of her right hand. She began to notice weakness of her left hand that had begun 2 years earlier. She had no history of trauma and no family history of amyloid neuropathy. She had a history of ovarian tumor 25 years ago and thyroid tumor 5 years ago, both of which healed after surgical resection.
Physical examination revealed a mass 5 × 3 cm in the ulnar side of her left proximal forearm shown in Figure . The lesion was firm, nonpulsatile, and tender on palpitation. She had numbness on the ulnar side of her left hand and fingers. The 2-point discrimination test revealed that 15 mm at the lateral side of the ring finger 10 mm at the little finger. She had muscle weakness with abduction and adduction of the ring finger and the little finger, but no deficit in the range of motion in the elbow. The electrophysiological study revealed a significant decrease in the motor nerve conduction velocity of the ulnar nerve from distal to the mass to proximal to the mass. MRI revealed that the ulnar nerve was swollen longitudinally, had a spindle shape, and measured 3.0 × 2.7 cm in the axial plane and 7.2 cm longitudinally shown in Figure . The swollen lesion had a relatively homogeneous isosignal intensity on T1-weighted images and had relative heterogeneous enhancement after the intravenous administration of gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agent with the findings of flow void. Based on these findings, the differential diagnoses included a vascular malformation that surrounded and compressed the ulnar nerve. Excisional biopsy was not performed because of the risk of hemorrhage and iatrogenic nerve injury. The lesion was instead surgically explored with a longitudinal incision shown in Figure . The operative findings showed no vascular malformation; however, the ulnar nerve fascicles were swollen and degenerated. The affected lesion had changed into a yellow tissue shown in Figure . After the yellow tissue was carefully removed microscopically, approximately 7 cm defects remained between intact nerve fascicles. The resected tissue was hard and had a stick-like shape shown in Figure .
The histopathological examination showed degenerated connective tissue with diffuse eosinophilic deposition, which included calcification, ossification, and chondroid tissue shown in Figure and b. No intact nerve tissue remained. The deposit was positive for Congo red stain and appeared apple-green under polarized light, which suggested the diagnosis of amyloid neuropathy shown in Figure .
Immunohistochemical staining showed that the deposit was immunopositive for light-chain λ antibody shown in Figure . The deposit was immunonegative for amyloid A, transthyretin, and light-chain κ. Therefore, the pathological diagnosis was AL amyloidosis.
To determine the association with systemic involvement, we conducted screening examinations. Bone marrow aspiration, cerebrospinal fluid examination, echocardiography, electromyography of the legs, chest computed tomography, and MRI of the brain and legs showed negative results. Physical examination revealed no sign of macroglossia or purpura on the skin. Autonomic dysfunction, including orthostatic hypotension, was not present. The only positive results were from the blood test, which showed high serum levels of amyloid protein A (159.2 μg/mL [<8.0]).
Two months postoperatively, the patient underwent nerve transplantation for reconstruction of the ulnar nerve. The sural nerve was sacrificed from the left lower leg and transplanted to the defect of the ulnar nerve. One year postoperatively after the nerve transplantation, she had no apparent evidence of metastasis or local recurrence. There was no recovery of numbness in the ring and little finger and the muscle weakness still had no recovery.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 55-year-old female presented with sudden onset of copious spontaneous CSF rhinorrhoea, which started 3 weeks ago noted on the right side. She denied history of headache, vomiting, blurring, visual disturbance, or head injury. The ophthalmoscopic examination revealed normal fundus exam, visual acuity, and field charting. The laboratory analysis of nasal discharge tested positive for CSF. The MRI cisternography was requested. The MRI was acquired in prone position. A moderate sized focus of CSF leakage was identified in the right cribriform plate [], which was seen continuing posteroinferiorly into moderate amount of CSF in the right ethmoid air cells []. The MRI also demonstrated a ballooned empty sella [], perioptic CSF distension [], and vertical tortuosity of the optic nerves [Figure –]. No intracranial mass was noted. Imaging diagnosis of IIH was suggested. CT scan showed a corresponding defect in the right cribriform plate []. The patient was referred for endoscopic/neurosurgical surgical repair.

"A 79-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital complaining of severe abdominal pain with unknown causes for 4 hours. The pain got worse after 2 hours with an acute hypotension (blood pressure drop from 106/79 mmHg to 61/44 mmHg), heart rate elevation (from 80 beats/min to 100 beats/min) and blunted. Laboratory investigation noted a decrease of hemoglobin from 119 g/dL to 62 g/dL in half an hour. Emergent computed tomographic angiography (CTA) showed the presence of a very tortuously ruptured AAA that now was 10.33 cm in diameter with a 90° neck angle (Figure A). The rupture, which extended from 2.5 cm below the opening of bilateral renal arteries down to the celiac artery and elongated to both common iliac arteries, involved the inferior mesenteric artery. Although the two iliac arteries were unobstructed with a 2.1 cm and 1.8 cm diameter of the right and left respectively, the right iliac artery was severely tortuous with a ‘S’ appearance (Figure B and C).
Previous medical history was normal except that she had a hypertension for more than 10 years with a maximum blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg, and was diagnosed of AAA by CTA with a maximum diameter of 6 cm in 2009. She refused to follow up because of no abdominal symptoms since then. She had no surgical history. Given the age of the patient and the emergent status, an endovascular approach was conducted despite the hostile neck. The time of door-to-cath lab was about 70 minutes. After local anesthesia, a 6-F, 11 cm-long introducer sheath (Cordis, Johnson & Johnson, NJ, USA) was placed percutaneously through the left groin for the diagnostic angiography, which confirmed the existence of an unfavorable aneurysm inferior to the renal artery (Figure A and Additional file : Movie S1). An 18-F, 30-cm-long sheath (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) was introduced and a 28-12-160-mm Excluder aortic main body (W.L. Gore &Associates) was deployed below the origin of the bilateral renal arteries (Additional file : Movie S2). Another 18-F, 30-cm-long sheath (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) was used, and two iliac legs of 20–120 and 20–100 (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) were placed superior to the opening of the right hypogastric respectively.
The guidewire was hard to enter the iliac leg due to the severely tortuous right iliac artery (Additional file : Movie S3), and therefore balloon-assisted technique was designed. The balloon was deployed in the proximal part of the main body and then inflated, thus keep the stiff wire in place which allowing the positioning of the guidewire (Figure B and Additional file : Movie S4).
In order to avoid the type Ib endoleak, we deployed a 26–30 cuff above the bifurcation of the iliac artery (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) (Figure C). A 20–140 iliac leg was placed above the bifurcation of the left iliac artery (Figure D). The stent-grafts were dilated using balloons (CODA, COOK, USA). The following angiography showed a severe Ia endoleak in the proximal neck (Figure E and Additional file : Movie S5), and therefore, a 32–4.0 Cuff (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) was deployed distal to opening of the left renal artery with off-the-shelf solution [] (Figure F).
Final angiography confirmed successful sealing of the rAAA with continued perfusion of both celiac and right renal arteries, and the aortic body pulsation disappeared accordingly (Figure G, H and Additional file : Movie S6). The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged home after 6 days. She is well and symptom-free 6 months later. Follow-up CT at 6 months demonstrated fluent celiac and bilateral renal arteries (Figure ).","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 14-year-old boy sustained a direct impact to his left shoulder due to an ice-hockey body-check. He complained acute pain and loss of function of his left shoulder. Initially the shoulder was immobilized in a shoulder sling and the patient was introduced to our department for shoulder and elbow surgery 10 days after the injury. Clinically, he presented with a prominent left acromioclavicular (AC) joint with pain on horizontal and vertical manipulation of the lateral clavicle, as well as marked tenderness over the coracoid process. Functional evaluation of the AC joint revealed a moderate superoinferior (3-5 mm) but no anteroposterior instability. Active range of motion (ROM) was restricted in every direction [ab-/adduction (Abd/Add): 50-0-10°; flexion/extension (F/E): 60-0-30°; external/internal rotation (ER/IR): 40-0-85°], passive ROM was normal. There was no evidence for an injury of brachial plexus or vascular compromise. The patient’s demands were complete and fast recovery with return to full sports as soon as possible, since he was playing ice-hockey in a first league team.
Computed tomography (CT) showed an AC joint separation with elevation of the lateral clavicle of 5 mm () and a fracture at the epiphysis of the coracoid base with 3 mm dislocation medially (). The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an AC joint sprain with intact AC capsule and ligaments as well as intact coracoclavicular ligaments (CCL) ().
We started non-operative treatment on first presentation with immobilization in a Camo®Shoulder brace (OPED, Valley/Oberlaindern, Germany). This device allows resting of the 90° flexed elbow on a pad, thereby partially unloading the shoulder girdle, with fixed abduction of 15° and internal rotation of 45° (). At clinical and radiological follow-up 2 weeks later, the patient presented with persisting tenderness over the coracoid process but less tenderness over the AC joint. Active ROM was still markedly restricted (Abd/Add: 60-0-10°; F/E: 60-0-30°; ER/IR: 40-0-80°). The radiographs ruled out a secondary dislocation of the coracoid process. Passive rotation of the shoulder within the dynamic brace was allowed between 30 and 60° IR from week 4 and between 20 to 80° IR from week 5 (). At 8 weeks follow-up the patient presented completely pain-free with full ROM () and without tenderness on palpation over the coracoid or the AC joint. Clinical tests for the AC joint, rotator cuff and long biceps tendon revealed to be normal. After week 8 the patient resumed ice-hockey training and regained sports activity on first league level after 12 weeks. After 5 months he presented with mild symptoms of subcoracoid impingement which was successfully treated with physiotherapy within 6 weeks. A MRI confirmed complete bony healing of the coracoid fracture without malalignement, a coracohumeral distance of 13mm and signs of a mild subcoracoid bursitis (,).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 91-year old man presented with severe dyspnea and fever for the last two days. He had a history of controlled diabetes and hypertension with heart failure. He notes persisting vomiting and food intolerance for the last 7 days. Physical examination revealed absent sounds on both lungs, with a normal abdominal exam. CXR revealed bilateral pleural effusions, left pneumonia, with a left thoracic opacity, suggestive of a large PEH. He was admitted on midcare cardiology unit for medical conservative treatment including a nasogastric decompressive tube, resuscitation and intra-venous antibiotics. A thoraco-abdominal CT-scan showed a giant paraesophageal hernia with complete intramediastinal gastric volvulus (). After a multidisciplinary discussion, the surgical volvulus reduction was approved and consented, as the mainstay treatment for the patient. The family members were informed and consented on the potential risks and benefits of the procedure. The patient underwent an emergency laparoscopic abdominal trans-hiatal hernia reduction, including complete sac excision, which was tightly adherent to the posterior mediastinum and needed a perioperative guided gastroscopy for the oesogastric junction, with placement of a decompressive nasogastric tube. After complete gastric reduction and sac excision we performed a posterior cruroplasty reinforced with two ePTFE large strips (). We also performed an anterior gastropexy with continuous barbed running suture 2/0. A mediastinal drain 16Fr. was placed. The patient was hemodynamically stable throughout the whole procedure. The patient was placed in the intensive care unit, where he was stable without any surgical complication since both drain and abdomen were clear. Unfortunately, he developed an acute respiratory failure syndrome, and died on the 4th post-op. day.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 64-year-old man was referred to our hospital with bulging of the sternal manubrium. He was otherwise asymptomatic. There was no antecedent history of Gardner syndrome, trauma or surgery. Physical examination revealed a firm, 3× 3 cm palpable sternal mass. The contrasted computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed a 4× 4 cm mass based on the sternal manubrium, with no apparent involvement of the mediastinal structures (Figure A and B). 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) revealed metabolically active areas around the manubrium, both sternoclavicular joints, and bilateral first sternocostal joints, which was suggestive of malignant tumor of the sternal manubrium. The patient refused to undergo preoperative fine-needle aspiration of the lesion. Thus the patient underwent a radical en bloc resection of the tumor and sternal reconstruction with autogenous rib grafts. At surgery, an expansile lesion involving the entire manubrium, both sternoclavicular joints, and bilateral first sternocostal joints was found. En bloc radical manubriectomy was performed including portions of the bilateral clavicles and first ribs. The specimen was removed 4 cm beyond the margin of the lesion. Then through a left anterior lateral incision, about 10 cm of the left fifth rib was harvested from the subperiosteum and carved into two parts with preservation of intact periosteum and pleura. Slots were cut into the ends of the two rib clips, bilateral clavicles, and the edge of the sternum using an electric drill. The two rib grafts were placed to form a T shape between the edges of the residual sternum and bilateral clavicles using rib nails, and then fixed with stainless steel wires. Histopathological examination revealed long fascicles of spindle-shaped cells with slight atypia arranged in a collagenous stroma, indicating a diagnosis of desmoid tumor (Figure A and B). The resection margins did not show any signs of neoplastic infiltration. Postoperative recovery was unremarkable and there were no complications. Three months postoperatively, computed tomography scan of the reconstructed chest showed neither instability of the chest wall nor evidence of tumor recurrence (Figure C). The patient has been free of disease for 46 months after surgery without any other treatment.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 32-year-old nulliparous married woman presents with complaints of chronic lower abdomen pain, dyspareunia, and infertility. Her general physical examination was normal with body mass index of 22 kg/m2. On speculum examination, a longitudinal vaginal septum was seen in the proximal portion of the vagina and the cervix was partially seen beyond the septum, at a high up position []. On vaginal examination, a single cervix was felt high up, slightly deviated to the right, and a normal anteverted uterus. An ultrasound showed a subseptate uterus with midline thick muscular septum and normal adnexa. MRI revealed septate uterus with septa extending till the cervix [Figures and ]. No anomaly was found in any other organ.
To complete the diagnosis, consent was taken for vaginal septum removal, followed by diagnostic hysterolaparoscopy. The couple was given the option of septoplasty in the same sitting or later in case of pregnancy complications. They chose to have it later.
Under anesthesia, the vaginal septum was held in between two alles forceps and divided in between the two with cautery. After the septum was removed, two dimples were seen high up in the vagina. They were double cervix confirmed by magnification with the hysteroscope. Two separate sounds could be inserted through the two cervices, ruling out any cervical atresia []. The uterocervical length in both sides was 3.5 inches. Hysteroscope was introduced through both the cervices. The septum was found to be complete till the level of the cervix delineating two separate cervical canals and two cavities. Cavities on both sides of the septum were found to be similar in size. The two ostia were visualized on the respective sides of the uterus. On introducing the laparoscope, the fundus was found to be smooth with a 2 cm fundal midline fibroid and with normal tubes and ovaries []. Thus, a diagnosis of complete uterine septum with two cervices and longitudinal vaginal septum was made. On chromopertubation spill was seen on both sides.
After 6 weeks of the vaginal septum resection, she reported an improvement in the dyspareunia and the heaviness in the lower abdomen []. She is being kept under follow-up to look for pregnancy complications and manage accordingly.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 58-year-old woman was newly diagnosed with advance (T3N1M0) moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of distal esophagus involving gastroesophageal junction. She received her first cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy Carboplatin and Paclitaxel. The next day, she presented to the emergency room with two episodes of hematemesis containing fresh blood. In addition to that she had progressive dysphagia for solids. She remained hemodynamically stable. The Rockall et al. score was 2, owing to the disseminated esophageal malignancy. Her blood reports showed a hemoglobin drop of 2.6 g from 13.1 to 10.5 mg/dL. The platelet count and coagulation profile were within the normal range along with the liver and renal functions also being unremarkable. After initial resuscitation, patient was made nil by mouth and started on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) infusion. After taking informed written consent, an upper GI endoscopy was done. The findings revealed a stenosing non-traversable tumor, starting at 33 cm from the incisors, containing old clotted blood as well as mild oozing, as shown in . Initially, an attempt was made to maintain hemostasis using conventional methods including adrenaline injection and hemospray, but this was unsuccessful for this purpose. In view of the stenosing tumor and ongoing bleed despite using the aforementioned measures, it was decided there and then to place a temporary 20 mm × 130 mm FCSEMS (nitinol). This would not only help to achieve luminal patency but would also aid in bleeding control due to the tamponade effect. Using a catheter, a guidewire was passed through the stricture and its position confirmed fluoroscopically, as shown in . An FCSEMS was deployed over the guidewire under both direct vision and fluoroscopic guidance, which is shown in and , respectively. No further episodes of hematemesis or melena were observed along with no further hemoglobin drop. Patient stayed for 72 h in the hospital and was later discharged with a follow-up plan for stent removal at 2 weeks. Patient, however, was lost to follow-up with the GI team but continued to have chemotherapy and radiation therapy. She was sent back for esophageal stent removal after 5 months. Esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD) revealed no bleed from tumor, stent was removed, and scope was passed freely across the tumor, as shown in . Patient followed up notes of radiation oncology clinics confirmed no episodes of upper GI bleed between the time of stent insertion and removal. No stent-related early and late complications were seen.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 35-year-old man was hospitalized after a 10-year history of occipitocervical pain and limited mobility (Fig. ). Physical examination revealed mild tenderness in the back of the upper cervical vertebrae and limited mobility of the neck. The muscle strength of the limbs was grade 4, and there was slight loss of limb and trunk sensation. Excretory function was normal. Pathological reflexes were positive, and bilateral patellar tendon reflexes were hyperactive. Cervical anteroposterior and lateral plain radiography, cervical computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an occipitocervical junction deformity accompanied by spinal cord compression. Occipitocervical deformity was diagnosed. On the fifth day after admission, the patient underwent a corrective operation involving posterior reduction and occipitocervical fixation and fusion. The bone graft comprised both ilium and artificial bone.
The standard occipitocervical posterior midline approach was adopted to expose the posterior structures of the C0–C3 vertebrae. Care was taken to protect the vertebral artery and posterior vascular plexus. Intraoperative fluoroscopy revealed that the occipitocervical joint sequence was good, and the reduction was successful. Screw insertion was a three-step process. First, occipital screws were inserted in the mediolateral tubercle and the occipital protrusion of the occipital bone (total of three occipital screws) []. Second, pedicle screws were inserted bilaterally in C2 using the Harms and Melcher technique [], and lateral mass screws were inserted bilaterally in C3 using the Roy–Camille et al. technique []. Third, an additional spinous process screw (3.5 mm diameter, 20 mm long) was inserted vertically into C2 []. The depth and angle of its implantation was determined using the Goel and Kulkarni technique [], and the screw itself was chosen according to its length and diameter based on the patient’s appearance on preoperative CT scans. Following screw insertion, three rods were then connected from C0 to C3. An occipital screw was placed in the occipital protrusion and connected to the C2 spinous process screw. A high-speed drill was used to prepare the bone graft bed on the posterior structure of the occipitocervical joint. The graft comprised bone from the posterosuperior ilium and artificial bone.
The patient could walk with a neck brace on postoperative day 3 and continued wearing the neck brace for the next 3 months. No neurovascular complications or incision infection were observed during the 24-month follow-up. Postoperative radiography showed that the internal fixation remained stable. Successful fusion was confirmed 4 months after the operation. Postoperative MRI showed that the occipitocervical decompression was sufficient, and there was no obvious spinal cord compression. The muscle strength of the limbs was grade 5, and at the 24-month follow-up visit the patient’s sensation function had improved from its preoperative state (Fig. ).","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 46-year-old man, with a history of heart valve replacement for rheumatic heart disease and taking warfarin 2.5 mg daily since 2008 was admitted to the emergency department at our hospital with hematemesis and tarry stool without any previous abdominal discomfort. Physical examination showed an anemic appearance with a hemoglobin level of 84.0 g/L without other abnormalities. His vital sign measurements were as follows: body temperature, 36.0°C; blood pressure, 108/44 mmHg; respiratory rate, 18 breaths/minute; and pulse rate, 77 beats/minute. The results of routine blood coagulation tests were as follows: prothrombin time, 21.7 s; international normalized ratio, 1.95; activated partial thromboplastin time, 46.2 s; fibrinogen, 1.47 g/L; and thrombin time, 16.9 s. He underwent upper GI endoscopy and was found to have a bleeding submucosal tumor at the stomach fundus, which is shown in . An exposed pulsatile vessel was seen at the defect. The patient and his family consented for him to undergo endoscopic obturation with tissue adhesive, and it was performed to treat the defect, as shown in . A modified “sandwich” method was used twice for the treatment. The injection was 2.0 mL of 50% glucose, 0.25 mL of undiluted tissue adhesive, and 3.0 mL of 50% glucose. The bleeding was successfully stopped, as shown in . No recurrence of bleeding was observed through a gastric tube and 6 days after endoscopic obturation, the patient underwent laparoscopic partial gastrectomy.

"A 67-year-old man presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and cardiogenic shock. His heart rate was around 120 to 130/min, and his systolic blood pressure was around 70 to 80 mm Hg even though vasoactive agent use. The patient developed pulmonary edema and progressed to profound cardiogenic shock status within 2 hours. Electrocardiography showed diffuse ST-segment depression in precordial leads and Q-wave in inferior leads. His coronary risk factors include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. He received intubation and ventilator support due to impending respiratory failure. IABP was set before diagnostic coronary angiography (CAG). CAG revealed severe calcified RCA subtotal occlusion at middle portion, with retrograde collaterals from the distal portion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) (Fig. A). From the distal LM to the mid LAD, there was a long tubular severe calcified 80% stenosis (Fig. B) and concomitant hypoplastic left circumflex artery (LCX) chronic total occlusion (CTO) without significant collaterals from LAD or RCA (Fig. C). Transthoracic 2-dimensional echocardiography revealed poor left ventricular performance and global hypokinesis with LVEF of 23%. His SYNTAX score (synergy between percutaneous coronary intervention with TAXUS and cardiac surgery) was 43, and the EuroScore (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation) was 20 (estimated perioperative mortality rate 20%–38%). The patient and his family refused coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Due to unstable hemodynamic condition, ECMO were set up immediately.
Coronary intervention was performed via right transradial (TR) approach because both femoral arteries were used for ECMO and IABP. A 6-French (Fr.) Ikari IL 3.5 guiding catheter (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was used for engaging the left main ostium. Tirofiban was used for intracoronary bolus and intravenous maintenance. After advancing a 0.014 Runthrough Floppy wire (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) to the distal LAD, sequential dilatation was performed using Maverick 2.5 × 20 mm (Boston Scientific, New York, USA) up to 18 atm, NC Sprinter 2.75 × 12 mm (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) up to 18 atm, NC Sprinter 3.0 × 12 mm (Medtronic) up to 20 atm, and Quantum 3.5 × 8 mm (Boston Scientific, USA) up to 28 atm. All of these balloons ruptured and long linear dissection occurred. Two drug-eluting stents (DES) Taxus Liberte (Boston Scientific, USA) 2.75 × 28 mm and 3.0 × 32 mm were deployed at mid LAD to distal LM, and subsequently, postdilatation of the in-stent portion up to 30 atm by Quantum (Boston Scientific, USA) 3.0 × 8 mm, 3.25 × 8 mm, and 3.5 × 8 mm balloons. Intra-vascular ultrasound (IVUS) and angiography (Fig. D) revealed that 2 stents were well deployed and well apposed to the vessel wall (Fig. E–H) with retrograde collaterals to the distal RCA.
We performed PCI for the difficult lesion of RCA to complete revascularization due to cardiogenic shock. A hydrophilic wire Pilot 50 (Abbott, Chicago, IL) was successfully advanced to the distal posterior descending artery with a 6 Fr. Ikari IL 3.5 guiding catheter (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) via the right TR approach. An Ottimo 1.5 × 10 mm balloon (Kaneka, Osaka, Japan) and a Maverick 2.0 × 20 mm balloon (Boston Scientific, USA) were used for dilatation of the lesions from mid RCA to proximal RCA up to 18 atm. Because the RCA was much angulated with an epsilon shape (Fig. A) and linear dissection occurred after balloon angioplasty, we tried to deploy stents from the distal to the ostium RCA but failed. Even though we employed methods such as 2 guidewire technique, balloon anchoring technique, 5-in-6 technique using 5Fr. ST01 catheter (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan), and deep-seating technique to deploy stents (including one drug-eluting stent), but all were unsuccessful when applied separately. Therefore, we proceeded to apply 3 techniques in combination (balloon anchoring technique, 5-in-6 technique, and deep-seating technique) to deploy the first stent Vision 2.75 × 18 mm (short stent) (Abbott) at the most angulated portion (Fig. B) which attributed the success of deploying other 4 stents from the distal to the ostium RCA: pixel 2.5 × 23 mm (Abbott), micro-Driver 2.5 × 24 mm (Medtronic, USA), Vision 3.0 × 28 mm, and Vision 3.5 × 12 mm. After high-pressure dilatation of the in-stent portion, IVUS and angiography (Fig. C) revealed that the 5 stents were well deployed and well apposed to the vessel wall (Fig. D–H).
We removed IABP and ECMO until cardiac contractile function improved to left ventricular ejection fraction over 40 percentage after 1 week. The patient was discharged after 2 months and had survival for 5 years.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 54-year-old Chinese man of Han nationality, a retiree, went to a local hospital because of hematuria. He had an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showing right renal mass and bilateral adrenal nodules. He was referred to our hospital for further examination and treatment. He denied any medical history, except for a 4-year history of hypertension. He took 5 mg amlodipine besylate every day. He was married and living with his family; he had smoked tobacco for 30 years and denied alcohol consumption. Members of his family had no history of endocrine diseases or malignant tumors.
At the time of admission, his temperature was 37 °C, the pulse was 80 per minute, and his blood pressure was 161/75 mmHg. His height was 168 cm and weight 64 kg. There was no physical sign of Cushing’s syndrome, such as central obesity, skin atrophy, buffalo hump, red striae of skin, or moon face. The results of his cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological examinations were all unremarkable. A laboratory examination (Table ) showed an electrolyte disturbance, in particular, a very low serum potassium level. His 24-hour urinary free cortisol was elevated. The function of his thyroid gland, parathyroid hormone, metanephrine, and normetanephrine were in normal range.
The endocrine findings (Table ) showed high plasma aldosterone level and low plasma renin concentration. He then underwent a captopril challenge test which did not show suppressed level of plasma aldosterone concentration. A diagnosis of PA was of no doubt. On the other hand, the circadian rhythm of cortisol disappeared, and his serum cortisol level was not suppressed by an overnight dexamethasone suppression test (ODST) and low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST). He was diagnosed as having SCS.
An abdominal CT scan revealed a mass in the parenchyma of his right kidney (Figs. and ) and there was a rounded, low-density mass in his right adrenal gland and a rounded, low-density mass in his left adrenal gland (Figs. , , , and ); the larger adrenal mass was approximately 2.6 cm × 2.3 cm on the left adrenal gland. These findings indicated the possibility of a renal tumor and bilateral adrenocortical adenomas.
Sequential adrenal venous sampling (AVS) without adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation was performed next. The result of AVS (Table ) reminded us that the right adrenal gland was responsible for aldosterone hypersecretion, and, quite possibly, the left was responsible for hypercortisolism.
Right nephrectomy and right partial adrenalectomy were performed first. The golden-yellow nodule in the right adrenal was approximately 2.5 cm × 2 cm × 0.8 cm macroscopically. The pathological diagnosis of the right adrenal nodule was adrenocortical adenoma. The right kidney tumor was proven to be a fibroma. Three days after operation, our patient’s serum potassium was 4.5 mmol/L without any supplementary treatment. The hypertensive drug was changed to 2 mg terazosin every day.
A laparoscopic left partial adrenalectomy was conducted 1 month later. When admitted to hospital, his blood pressure was 127/83 mmHg controlled by 2 mg terazosin every day, and his level of potassium was 4.9 mmol/L without any supplementary treatment. We examined his cortisol at 8 a.m. before operation, which was 344.81 nmol/L. The operation was successful and the level of cortisol at 8 a.m. had reduced to 192.01 nmol/L 2 days after operation. The nodule in the left adrenal was golden-yellow; it was approximately 3 cm × 2.5 cm × 2 cm. The pathological diagnosis of the left adrenal gland nodule was proven to be adrenocortical adenoma. After the second operation, doctors advised 30 mg hydrocortisone should be taken once a day with a weekly reduction of 10 mg until withdrawal, and 2 mg terazosin should be taken once a day.
During postoperative follow-up, terazosin was gradually stopped, and blood pressure and serum potassium remained normal. Approximately 2 months later, his ACTH concentration was 98.73 pg/ml which was above the reference value. This meant our patient had adrenocortical insufficiency, and he continued to take hydrocortisone. Months later, hydrocortisone was stopped, the concentration of cortisol and ACTH were 233.46 nmol/L and 49.43 pg/ml, respectively. The plasma aldosterone concentration was 104 pg/ml and plasma renin concentration was 3.1 uIU/ml. Normalization of aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR), cortisol, and ACTH were reached and our patient did not complain of any discomfort.
Immunohistochemistry (Fig. ) of the two adrenal nodules revealed that the right one had positive immunostaining for CYP11B2, which is essential to synthesize aldosterone, and the left one had positive immunostaining for CYP11B1, which is essential to synthesize cortisol. These results confirmed the right nodule was responsible for the secretion of aldosterone and the left nodule was responsible for the secretion of cortisol. Somatic KCNJ5 mutation (Leu168Arg) was found in the right adrenal tumor (Fig. ), and there was no KCNJ5 mutation in the left adrenal tumor.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 43-year-old Caucasian female presented with multiple episodes of loose, watery, dark stools. Her presentation was associated with gradual onset, colicky, lower abdominal pain since the previous day. She otherwise denied any fever, nausea, or vomiting, history of ill contact, or any history of travelling or taking outside food. No one within her household had similar symptoms.
The patient had been diagnosed several years earlier with multiple sclerosis (MS) and is wheel-chair-bound due to that disease. She had been prescribed alemtuzumab in a clinical trial 10 years preceding this presentation and had used teriflunomide for one year prior to being prescribed ocrelizumab by her neurologist—she had received two doses six months apart. She denied any prior history of inflammatory bowel disease or bowel cancer.
Upon examination, it was noted that she was afebrile and was haemodynamically stable. Examination of the abdomen revealed a soft abdomen with tenderness at the suprapubic and iliac regions with increased bowel sounds but no evidence of peritonism or organomegaly. Digital per rectal examination established an empty rectum.
The patient was ordered a range of initial laboratory and imaging investigations and follow-up diagnostics based on those findings (Tables and ). The abdominal X-ray () demonstrated a classical thumbprinting sign that was nonspecific but suspicious for clostridium difficile infection. Empirical antibiotics IV metronidazole and oral vancomycin were commenced for presumed clostridium difficile infection while awaiting for laboratory tests and histology results.
The patient's venous blood gas showed lactate of 4 mmol/L (normal range, 0.6–1.8 mmol/L) which prompted a CT abdomen. The CT demonstrated a pronounced colitis extending from the transverse colon to the sigmoid colon. When the patient did not respond to IV metronidazole and oral vancomycin, a flexible sigmoidoscopy was undertaken and showed nodular mucosa with white-yellowish adherent plaques with increasing severity from the rectosigmoid to the sigmoid (Figures and ). The histology from biopsies taken from various parts of the left colon was negative for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and clostridium difficile infection, but suggestive of biological medication effect.
Accordingly, the patient was treated as ocrelizumab-induced colitis and commenced on intravenous hydrocortisone. Her CRP was downtrending on hydrocortisone. However, serial abdominal X-rays demonstrated ongoing gaseous distension, and she continued having watery bowel motions. The patient was referred to a tertiary hospital and colorectal surgeons for medication-resistant biological medication-induced colitis. She subsequently underwent a total colectomy and ileostomy formation.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 37-year-old African American female with a history of two unprovoked deep venous thromboses (DVT) treated with apixaban was evaluated for a pruritic rash of two weeks' duration. She had started apixaban two months prior to the rash onset; there were otherwise no changes in her medication regimen. The exam showed hyperpigmented brown scaly plaques with central atrophic patches on the conchal bowl of the ears (Figure ), violaceous nodules, and indurated plaques with scattered flaccid vesicles on the medial thighs, knees, and antecubital fossae (Figures , ), and eroded plaques with dry, serosanguinous crust on the elbows. Vesicles were not appreciated on non-lesional skin and there was no mucosal involvement. She endorsed hematuria and weight loss but denied lesion photosensitivity. Laboratory analysis was significant for leukopenia (WBC of 3.4 thousands/μL), anemia (hemoglobin of 5.6 g/dL), and proteinuria. Serology was positive for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (>1:160), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), anti-Smith, anti-Ro/SSA, cardiolipin antibody, beta2 glycoprotein antibody, and low C3 and C4 complement.
A 4-mm punch biopsy of a representative lesion from the medial knee was performed. Histopathologic findings suggested early SCLE and consisted of basilar vacuolar degeneration with scant dermal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate (Figure ). Colloidal iron staining highlighted mucin deposition throughout the superficial and deep dermis (Figure ). Apixaban was discontinued and warfarin initiated. Triamcinolone 0.01% was used as needed for her skin. She remains in remission at her three-month follow-up, treated with hydroxychloroquine (200 mg BID), mycophenolate mofetil (1 gm BID), and prednisone (40 mg daily) for her SLE and lupus nephritis, respectively.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 57-year-old woman was admitted for painful lower leg ulcers. Past history included subcutaneous injection of esthetic filler material in the lower legs 20 years ago, hypothyroidism and HIV infection on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART: raltegravir, abacavir, lamivudine). Viral load was negative and CD4 cells were 600/μl. One year before admission, bilateral torpid lower leg ulcers developed after minor trauma and progressively expanded. She was treated with diclofenac.
On admission blood pressure was 190/88 mmHg (previously normal) and she had extensive necrotic ulceration and edema in both lower legs. Key lab results were serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dl (previously 1.0 mg/dl), serum albumin 3.5 mg/dl, serum cholesterol 139 mg/dl, complement factor 3 (C3) nadir 63 mg/dl, normal C4, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, urinary albumin:creatinine ratio 2082 mg/g, urinary protein:creatinine ratio 3557 mg/g and urinary sediment containing 20–40 red blood cells/high power field. ANCA, ANA, and anti-GBM were negative. Ulcer cultures grew Group A streptococcus pyogenes.
Kidney biopsy (two cores; 9 and 11 mm long) containing 26 glomeruli, 2 of them completely sclerosed, disclosed diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis characterized by glomerular hypercellularity due to mesangial proliferation and endocapillary leukocytic infiltration (Fig. ). Trichrome staining revealed subepithelial fuchsinophilic deposits. Jones silver stain did not show spikes or basement membrane reduplication (Fig. ). Coarse mesangial and peripheral capillary loop staining for C3 was seen on immunofluorescence (Fig. ), without IgG, IgA or IgM deposition. Round translucent, non-birefringent microspherical bodies (30–35 μm) resembling adipocytes were identified within some capillary lumens (Figs. and ). Microspheres were also seen in a globally sclerosed glomerulus (Fig. ). In the tubulointerstitial compartment, intratubular red blood cell casts, acute tubular damage and patchy interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates were noted. Vessels showed arteriolar hyalinosis and moderate myointimal hyperplasia. Ultrastructural study revealed subepithelial deposits (‘humps’) (Fig. ).
Treatment included local debridement, antibiotics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Estimated glomerular filtration rate, C3 and microhematuria normalized at month 3, 5 and 12, respectively, while albuminuria progressively improved over the next 12 months (Fig. ). One year after the initial admission, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors had been stopped and serum creatinine was 0.9 mg/dl, estimated glomerular filtration rate 94 ml/min/1.73 m2, urinary albumin:creatinine ratio 188 mg/g and urinary sediment contained no red blood cells/high power field.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"An 83 year old retired Caucasian lady was admitted to a UK hospital with a recent history of back pain without any trauma. She had no significant past medical history of note and her only regular medication included a statin for cholesterol. She was a non-smoker and drunk only minimal amounts of alcohol. X-rays on admission demonstrated severe osteoporosis with multiple collapsed lumbar vertebrae. Whilst awaiting a brace and social support she developed diarrhoea and vomiting. An initial stool sample was negative for clostridium difficile serotoxin. Over the next few days her clinical condition deteriorated and by day 6 her C-reactive protein was 357. She developed abdominal distension, pain and a plain x-ray showed centralised dilated small bowel loops. A subsequent CT scan of her abdomen revealed small bowel obstruction together with mural thickening of the distal ileum (see Figure ).
Following CT the patient developed signs of localised peritonitis and underwent a laparotomy. At surgery necrosis and ischaemia was seen in a large portion of mid-ileum together with large quantities of pus and a localised perforation. A small bowel resection of 60 cm was performed. Histology revealed an acute gangrenous ileitis. Blood, urine and stool cultures were all negative but reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of stool cultures revealed Norovirus genogroup II. Immunoassay of the stool was negative for rotavirus and adenovirus. No specific testing for astrovirus was performed. Immunological testing of the histological specimens was not performed.
The patient had no prior history of vascular disease to suggest the cause of the ileitis was ischaemic enterocolitis. Furthermore despite the patient's back pain she had been mobilising around her bed in the hospital therefore it is unlikely that the cause of the ileitis was paralytic ileus secondary to immobility. The patient received only as required opiate analgesia and this was co-administered with appropriate laxative cover to avoid constipation. A diagnosis of acute gangrenous ileitis secondary to Norovirus was therefore made. It was postulated that the virus had triggered a localised inflammatory response leading to necrosis which had continued despite clearing of the virus by host immune responses. The virus was thought to be a nosocomial infection as there was no recent history of foreign travel or contact with individuals demonstrating the symptoms of gastro-enteric disease prior to admission. However antibody testing for IgG and IgM was not performed therefore the length of infection with the virus was unclear.
Following surgery the patient developed a pelvic collection requiring CT guided drainage which matured into an enterocutaneous fistula. The fistula was treated conservatively and sealed spontaneously at 10 weeks at which point she was discharged.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"This is a 15-year-old boy with compound heterozygous LDLR c.313+1G>A and a deletion spanning exon 1–6. Both parents have HeFH with no evidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The patient was diagnosed at the age of 2 years old as a result of the presence of xanthomas. LDL-C levels were found to be elevated to 982 mg/dL, and diagnosis was confirmed via genetic testing. Asymptomatic aortic insufficiency was evident. Medication was commenced with atorvastatin 40 mg/day plus ezetimibe 10 mg/day. The patient received once-weekly lipoprotein apheresis, but LDL-C levels remained elevated (mean interval LDL-C 197 mg/dL). At the age of 8.5 years, chest pain led to a diagnosis of angina and a coronary bypass operation. LA was intensified to two times per week.
At 13.5 years of age, prior to the initiation of lomitapide, mean interval LDL-C levels were at 85 mg/dL with LA twice weekly, and therefore well below current treatment target. Unlike the other patients in this case series, the treatment plan for this patient was to attempt to maintain the LDL-C levels at target but to reduce the apheresis burden. Lomitapide was commenced at a dose of 5 mg/day and apheresis was decreased to once weekly. After 6 months, the lomitapide dose was intensified to 10 mg/day followed by 15 mg/day and after an additional 5 months, apheresis was reduced to Q2W. Through these modifications, LDL-C levels remained under control (nadir 62 mg/dL) (Fig. ).
No adverse events have been reported for lomitapide, liver enzymes and imaging are normal, and the patient has reported improved quality of life due to less disruption from apheresis sessions resulting in less time away from school, sports and other leisure activities. As a result, the LDL-C target levels have been maintained despite reducing apheresis burden by 75%.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 57-year-old female patient came to the hospital with pain in both thighs, especially on the right side. The pain was exacerbated during weight bearing and walking and decreased while resting.
In the physical examination, there was direct tenderness in the right thigh and right groin region. But no edema or external abnormality was observed. The range of motion of the hip joint was normal, and there were no abnormal neurological findings. On the simple radiographic inspection, the cortical bone of the right proximal femur was thinned and showed cystic change. Decreased bone density was also observed and the trabecular bone of the overall femur was thinned (). The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on the part showing cystic bone change to determine the bone tumor. Lesions with a low signal in T1WI () and a high signal in T2W1 () were observed in the proximal femur on both sides and in the right pubis. Based on the MRI findings, brown tumor was suspected. An additional blood test was conducted and serum intact parathyroid hormone was 2,720 pg/mL (normal, 15-65 pg/mL), alkaline phosphatase was 2,417 U/L (normal, 104-338 U/L), calcium was 14.5 mg/dL (normal, 8.6-10.4 mg/dL), and phosphate was 2.0 mg/dL (normal, 2.6-4.4 mg/dL). To find out the cause of hyperparathyroidism, we did the ultrasonography of the thyroid. Since a nodule was observed in the left lobe of the parathyroid, fine needle aspiration was performed to obtain pathological results from the parathyroid. Furthermore as malignant change could not be excluded with the presence of a relatively large nodule, a parathyroidectomy was decided.
On the 14th day from admission, the day for parathyroidectomy, the patient felt sudden pain in the right thigh while getting up from a bed to sit down in the morning, and radiographic inspection was performed. In the femur anteroposterior and lateral images, a pathological fracture was confirmed in a site where the brown tumor had formed (). Closed reduction and internal fixation with the intramedullary nailing was performed in orthopaedic surgery department, and a biopsy was conducted using specimen tissue obtained during the medullary reaming. And the additional biopsy was performed along with the parathyroidectomy in the head and neck surgery department. The blood calcium concentration decreased to 10.0 mg/dL after the surgery, and the blood parathyroid hormone concentration became normalized after a month (). In a biopsy on the femoral lesion, brown tumor was diagnosed. The biopsy of the parathyroid confirmed the parathyroid carcinoma. Four months after the surgery, the union of the fracture was confirmed (). The patient became capable of walking without a crutch or walkers by a follow-up ten months after the surgery.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 53-year-old African American female with a body mass index of 27.2 kg/m2 and a history of coronary artery disease, end-stage renal disease, cervical carcinoma and a right atrial thrombus, presented to our emergency department from an outside hospital bleeding profusely from her rectum. At an outside facility, two self-expanding nasal tampons (Rhino Rockets, Shippert Medical Technologies, Centennial, Colorado, USA) were placed in the rectum to control bleeding and two units of PRBCs were transfused. While still in the emergency department, MTP was started, and 2 g of intravenous tranexamic acid (TXA) were administered.
The patient was emergently taken to the operating room, but surgical efforts failed to control the bleeding as the pelvic radiation therapy she had previously received to treat a cervical carcinoma had distorted her anatomy such that her internal iliac artery could not be visualized. Proctoscopy performed after total colectomy revealed a still massive amount of blood coming from the lower rectum or anal canal. A balloon was fashioned with a Penrose drain and Foley catheter to create a tamponade effect in the rectum; however, this was effective for only a short while. Thromboelastography (TEG) results – a normal reaction time (R) time of 7 min, a decreased alpha angle of 40° and decreased maximum amplitude of 36.7 mm – pointed toward a coagulopathy secondary to fibrinogen and platelet deficiency. The patient continued to receive fresh frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate and platelets. While there was a concern of a coagulopathy related to the apixaban, the patient was prescribed for atrial thrombus, the etiology of bleeding, in this case, was surgical. During the consultation with the interventional radiology service for angioembolization, she was brought to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) for interval management with the rectal balloon in place.
In the SICU, two rapid transfuser devices (Level 1, H-1200 Fast Flow Fluid warmer, Dublin, OH, USA) were assembled, and a wide-bore central venous catheter was inserted. MT was continued with a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 50–60 mmHg through the administration of blood products, norepinephrine, and vasopressin infusion and intermittent boluses of epinephrine. Resuscitation was guided by vital signs, bedside echocardiography, serial TEG and perfusion biomarkers such as serum lactate and base deficit. A >14 L blood loss was recorded in the SICU in 90 min.
In the interventional radiology suite, a fistula between the right common iliac and the rectum was identified as the source of bleeding. A 10 mm × 40 mm covered self-expanding intravascular stent (Fluency, Bard Peripheral Vascular, Tempe, AZ, USA) successfully stopped the bleeding. In total, the patient received 60 units PRBC, 23 units FFP, 20 packs of platelets, 6 units cryoprecipitate, 2 g TXA, 30 L of crystalloid, and 2 L of albumin in <7 h.
Serial focused cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS) guided the resuscitation. Hypothermia, serum lactate, and base deficit improved from 35.4, 7 and − 10–36.8, 1.9 and − 4 respectively, in the next 4 h. By that point, the patient was able to follow commands and required minimal ventilatory support. In the ensuing days, there were no signs of lung injury, volume overload, coagulopathy, or cardiomyopathy. Her abdomen was closed 2 days later, successfully extubated shortly thereafter, and transferred to the floor.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A healthy 37 year old IV gravida II para came to our hospital in 22 + 6 weeks of pregnancy for a second opinion with suspected placenta percreta. She has had two prior caesarean sections (the first one due to breech presentation, the second one planned repeated) and one early abortion followed by curettage. In ultrasound, the placenta praevia totalis of the anterior uterine wall showed distinct signs of placenta percreta with suspected bladder invasion. No myometrium between placenta and bladder and very irregular patterns of perfusion were observed, such as large lacunas and bridging vessels in the interface (Figs. and ). The MRI confirmed the suspected placenta percreta with no valid signs of invading other organs. She was counseled in detail about the serious risks of this diagnosis. Termination of the pregnancy was not an option for our patient. She had the urgent wish to preserve fertility due to unfinished family planning with a new partner. Segmental excision (if possible) or leaving the placenta in situ was planned. For the case of emergency, we also had her consent for hysterectomy, though. At 34 + 5 weeks of gestation, she presented with preterm contractions, secondary caesarean section through a fundal uterine incision after amniotic drainage and exteriorization of the gravid uterus [] was performed in combined neuraxial anesthesia and general anesthesia after birth without complications. Due to high risk of intraoperative bleeding, an arterial line and two 16 G peripheral vein cannulas were placed. Additionally, red blood cell concentrates as well as fresh frozen plasma were provided in theatre and cell savage, and norepinephrine was prepared in case of massive bleeding. Prophylactic tranexamic acid was applied continuously in a dosage of 15 mg/kg/bw during surgery without complications. A healthy boy of 2800 g, Apgar 8/8/8, NapH 7.31 was delivered, estimated blood loss was 500 ml. Due to extensive size of at least 10 × 8 cm of the percrete area, the placenta was left in situ. No transfusions of blood or hemostatic products were necessary and no further postpartum hemorrhage occurred.
The postoperative course remained without complications. She received an antibiotic prophylaxis with metronidazole and cefuroxime, regular blood tests for inflammation parameters and cervical swabs for bacteria were taken and showed no signs of infection, no vaginal hemorrhage occurred. She was discharged into ambulant care on day seven; weekly check-ups for infection and the antibiotic prophylaxis (400 mg of metronidazole two times a day, 500 mg of cefuroxime three times a day, oral application) were continued. Matching the antibiogram of bacteria from cervical swabs, the antibiotic therapy was changed to amoxicillin in the further course.
On day 54, she presented with vaginal bleeding. Blood tests still showed no signs of infection, in ultrasound, the placenta was in situ with reduced perfusion.
The different treatment options were discussed; embolism of the uterine arteries, hysterectomy vs. segmental uterine resection (if possible) or expectant management. On ultrasound examination, the uterus and also the percrete area presented significantly smaller, a surgical approach with uterine preservation (if possible) was planned. The preoperative blood work-up showed a reduced Quick value of 41%, increased d-dimere levels > 20 mg/l (normal range < 0.5 mg/l) and reduced fibrinogen levels of 0.59 g/l (normal range 1.6–4 g/l), so that 1 g of tranexamic acid was administered preoperatively. The hemoglobin level was 13.6 g/dl. Segmental uterine resection was performed and the uterus could be reconstructed. The bladder was not invaded as suspected in ultrasound, but surgical preparation and separation of the bladder wall from placental tissue resulted in a small bladder wall lesion which had to repaired (Figs. and ).
Right from the beginning of the surgery, a diffuse bleeding tendency was observed. The thromboelastometric analysis (ROTEM®, TEM International, Munich, Germany) at the beginning of surgery showed a prolonged clotting time (CT: 126 s (46–83 s)) as well as reduced amplitudes of the fibrinogen related clot formation at different time points [A5: 3 (5–30) mm; A10: 4 (6–21) mm; A20: 4 (6–21) mm; A30: 4 (6–21) mm] in the FIBTEM® Test (Fig. ). These results are in line with the reduced fibrinogen levels of the preoperative blood work-up. Furthermore, the INTEM® and EXTEM® analysis with prolonged clot formation times [CFT INTEM®: 151 (62–130) s; CFT EXTEM®: 178 (46–149) s.], the reduced clotting amplitudes at all time points (A5–A30; Fig. ) as well as the reduced Quick value of 41% in the preoperative blood work-up indicate an impaired coagulation due to fibrinogen consumption and a beginning DIC with a concomitant consumption of clotting factors (Fig. ) []. Hyperfibrinolysis could not be detected; TXA had been administered before, though (Fig. ). Nevertheless, an increased d-dimere level > 20 mg/l in the preoperative blood work-up suggests a sign of initially increased local hyperfibrinolysis before TXA was given. In consideration of the thromboelastometric analysis and the results of the blood work-up accompanied with ongoing intraoperative bleeding, two red blood cell concentrates (RBC) at a further decreasing hemoglobin level of 6.8 g/dl, three fresh frozen plasma units (FFP), prothrombin complex concentrate (PSSB, 1800 IE), 4 g of fibrinogen and tranexamic acid [15 mg/kg body weight (bw)] were administered until the bleeding could be controlled. A continuous application of norepinephrine in a dosage up to 0.2 μg/kg bw/min was temporally necessary for hemodynamic stabilization. Estimated blood loss was 3500 ml.
After surgery, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for 24 h without any signs of recurrent bleeding or cardiorespiratory limitations. Coagulation parameters had already normalized 8 h after the operation (Quick value 87%, fibrinogen 2.41 g/l) and the hemoglobin levels remained stable (around 8 g/dl). On day seven, the cystogram showed no persistent bladder lesion, the catheter could be removed. The patient was discharged on the seventh postoperative day (day 62 postpartum) in good health condition. Due to segmental resection of the uterine wall, we did not recommend a pregnancy for the next two years.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 41-year-old Caucasian woman underwent a primary double lung transplantation for cystic fibrosis in 2006. Her medical history was otherwise unremarkable and the patient had no known history of pulmonary tuberculosis or tuberculosis contact. On December 2015, she underwent retransplantation for chronic lung allograft dysfunction. During the month preceding retransplantation, 4 sputum specimens remained negative for acid-fast bacilli and specific M. tuberculosis culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. On postoperative day 42, deterioration of her respiratory status prompted a chest-computerized tomography (CT) scan revealing sub-centimeter bilateral nodules primarily located in the apical posterior lobes and a bilateral pleural effusion (Fig. ). The same day, a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) yielded a positive real-time PCR for rifampicin-susceptible M. tuberculosis, confirmed by culture on postoperative day 62. Tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) test were not performed. All the BALs performed on postoperative period yielded no other pathogen except for the one performed on day 60 that cultured Pseudomonas aeruginosa; the adjunctive antibiotic therapy was imipenem-cilastatin, 3 g/d. Histological examination of a lung biopsy performed 6 weeks after retransplantation revealed a caseating granuloma and necrosis. Acid-fast bacilli were identified as rifampicin-susceptible M. tuberculosis by real-time PCR. On postoperative day 65, the patient's status worsened with severe hypoxemia, shock unresponsive to high dose cathecolamines, and multiorgan failure. The patient died on postoperative day 70, despite treatment combining isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. Retrospective real-time PCR testing of the explanted lung and BALs performed on postoperative days 1, 7, and 21 remained negative.
The organ donor died of posttraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage. He was a 47-year-old man with no history of lung disease or risk factors for tuberculosis other than chronic alcohol use and smoking. TST results were not available. During hospitalization, a lung CT-scan showed no signs of active or previous tuberculosis and no TST or IGRA test results were available. Routine cultures of per-transplantation right lung biopsy yielded Candida albicans. Retrospective M. tuberculosis real-time PCR yielded negative results on the left and right donor-lung biopsies. Both kidneys from the same donor were transplanted into 2 other recipients. Six months after transplantation, neither of the kidney recipients had developed any signs or symptoms suggestive of active tuberculosis.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"While feeding a 5-year-old male black mamba, a 34-year-old snake breeder suddenly noticed a tiny bloody mark on his forearm and, at the same time, a slight tingling of his lips. He immediately realized that he had been bitten and called a befriended snake expert to seek advice. The patient was thus able to provide the first responders with detailed information about the snake and on where to obtain the corresponding antivenin. He instructed his wife to apply a pressure bandage to the forearm. Within the next five minutes, chest tightness, generalized paresthesia, and fasciculation occurred. Upon arrival of the ambulance, the patient was unable to walk, was tachypneic, and had prominent dysarthria. Assuming a concomitant allergic reaction, the paramedics administered methylprednisolone, clemastine, and adrenaline before transferring the patient to the nearest hospital. In the meantime, the Swiss helicopter ambulance collected the antivenin from one of the 8 national antivenin depots.
Forty minutes after the bite, the patient arrived in the emergency department, complaining of worsening fasciculations and paresthesia affecting the extremities and the face. On physical examination, he was fully conscious with a heart rate of 105/min and a blood pressure of 165/80 mmHg. He was tachypneic at 30/min. Pulse oximetry revealed an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. There were two tiny puncture wounds with local swelling and redness on the left forearm. Motor function was normal, except for mild ptosis. Seventy minutes after the bite, the patient was given 2 vials (20 ml) of “SAMIR Polyvalent Snake Antivenin” together with 2.5 mg of IV midazolam for ongoing hyperventilation. Thereafter, the patient was transferred to our tertiary intensive care unit for further treatment.
Upon arrival in our ICU, the patient was hemodynamically stable but still tachycardic and tachypneic. Fasciculations, dysarthria, and ptosis had slightly improved. ECG showed a grade 1 atrioventricular block without any other abnormalities. Initial laboratory tests were unremarkable, apart from moderate respiratory alkalosis. Over the next few hours, sweating, chills, and difficulty with swallowing as well as nausea occurred. However, the airway was never compromised, coughing reflex was intact, and respiratory failure did not occur. Therefore, and because of initial concerns about a possible allergic reaction, we decided against further antivenin administration. On the next day, symptoms of envenomation had improved, but the patient developed cellulitis of the bitten forearm and rhabdomyolysis, with a peak serum creatine kinase level of 16,049 U/L. Upon treatment with intravenous fluids and amoxicillin/sulbactam, his condition gradually improved. After four days in the hospital, he was discharged home with muscular pain as the only residual symptom. A few weeks later, the patient had fully recovered.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 2-month, 24-day-old girl was referred to our department presenting with recurrent vomiting. The birth and medical history were uneventful. The patient had metabolic acidosis (pH 7.267, bicarbonate 17.6 mmol/L), alkaline urine (pH 7.5), and hypokalemia (serum potassium 2.4 mmol/L). An ultrasound of the kidneys demonstrated increased echo reflectance at the bilateral medulla. The patient was initially given common treatments to replace fluids and to correct the acidosis and hypokalemia. However, the metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia remained during for 4 days (Table ). Meanwhile, the hearing, liver function, renal function, count of blood cell, C-reactive protein, and erect abdominal x-ray results were normal. Because hereditary dRTA was suspected, the patient was treated with potassium citrate on day 5 after admission. Since treatment initiation, the patient has shown normal pH and potassium levels.
Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from whole blood using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Shanghai, China) per the manufacturer's instructions. A minimum of 3 μg DNA was used for the indexed Illumina libraries according to the manufacturer's protocol (MyGenostics, Inc., Beijing, China). DNA fragments with sizes ranging from 350 bp to 450 bp and those including the adapter sequences were selected for the DNA libraries. Next, the genes associated with the endocrine system were selected using a gene capture strategy and the GenCap custom enrichment kit (MyGenostics, Inc., Beijing, China) following the manufacturer's protocol. The biotinylated capture probes (80–120-mer), were designed to tile all of the exons with non-repeated regions.
The patient was found to have a homozygous deletion in exons 13 and 14 of the ATP6V0A4 gene, which confirmed the diagnosis (Fig. ). Moreover, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (qRT-PCR) of exons 13 and 14 from the ATP6V0A4 gene using 3 primer pairs was performed on both the patient and her parents using a SYBR@Premix Ex TaqTM (TAKARA, Japan). The Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR system was applied to amplify and quantify the ribonucleic acid (RNA). The relative RNA quantity was calculated based on the comparative Ct and analyzed by the Sequence Detection System software package version 2.0 (PE Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). The patient's father was found to have a heterozygous deletion of the same regions whereas the mother was found to be normal (Fig. ).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 19-year-old female with no significant past medical history was referred to the emergency department from her antenatal clinic for further evaluation of fever 102 F, headache, malaise, nausea, and vomiting of 4-days duration following mild sore throat. She was in her 28th week of gestation on presentation. Physical examination showed an obese and anxious-appearing lady in mild respiratory distress with gravid abdomen. She weighed 142 kilograms (kg) with a BMI of 44.3. Her blood pressure was 111/60 mmHg, respiratory rate 24, heart rate 111, temperature 101.8 F, and oxygen saturation 96% on 2 liters (L) nasal cannula oxygen. She had dry mucous membranes, with no oral thrush or ulcers. Her abdomen was gravid with focal areas of tenderness, bowel sounds were heard, and fetal movement was detected. Pulmonary and cardiovascular examinations were unremarkable.
Her initial laboratory tests were significant for white blood cell (WBC) count of 11.8 K/uL with 78% neutrophil predominance and lymphopenia (0.77 K/uL). Although she had no urinary symptoms, urinalysis showed bacteriuria, confirmed as group B streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) with cultures. Initial chest X-ray and liver enzymes on admission were unremarkable. She was started on intravenous fluids for suspected gastroenteritis and oral cephalexin for asymptomatic GBS infection. Stool studies for clostridium difficile, comprehensive panel, ova, and parasites were ordered which all returned negative. However, she continued to spike fever through the third day of hospitalization prompting expansion of antibiotic coverage to Vancomycin and Zosyn (). Liver transaminases which had been normal began to spike. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 190, alanine aminotransferase (AST) was 135, and alkaline phosphatase was 110 while bilirubin remained normal. Serum Tylenol and hepatitis A, B, and C serologies were negative. Infectious Disease (ID) consultation was requested who recommended further infectious work-up with CMV, EBV, HIV, HSV, Rickettsia, and Leptospira serologies.
The patient continued to spike high grade fever reaching 103 F on day 4 of admission despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics and negative infectious work-up including the aforementioned serologies. She also developed bloody diarrhea and acute kidney injury (AKI) prompting evaluation for possible Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and autoimmune diseases which all returned negative as well. Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed normal liver and gallbladder morphologies. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed diffuse T2 hyperintensity throughout the liver compatible with acute liver injury but was negative for any focal intra-abdominal or pelvic abscess.
One week into her hospitalization, her AST and ALT kept trending up reaching a peak of 1712 U/L and 845 U/L, respectively (), mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase 140, INR 1.6, normal total bilirubin, absolute lymphocyte count of 0.11 K/uL, persistently negative blood cultures, and serum creatinine increased to 2.9 mg/dL, all concerning for a disseminated process. She became increasingly lethargic, tachycardic, and tachypneic necessitating care in the intensive care unit. With uprising liver enzymes and negative extensive infectious and rheumatologic work-up including Hep A, B, C serologies and PCR, EBV, CMV, Parvovirus, Rickettsia, and Leptospiral serologies, as well as negative HSV 1 and 2 IgM and IgG antibodies, antinuclear, and anti-liver-kidney microsomal antibodies, normal cryoglobulins, ceruloplasmin, alpha 1 antitrypsin and serum copper levels, and largely unremarkable imaging and stool studies, a decision was made to proceed with a liver biopsy. At this time, empiric acyclovir was started while other antibiotics were discontinued per ID recommendations.
Within the first 24 hours of starting acyclovir, AST and ALT began to downtrend while fever and diarrhea improved (). Despite negative HSV-2 serologies, the PCR was reported on hospital day-8 with a very high viral load >100 million DNA copies/ml following which she reported a remote history of cold sores but denied a history of genital ulcers. A diagnosis of HSV hepatitis was made and she was transitioned to Val-acyclovir 1 gram three times daily to complete 14 days of therapy, then to resume acyclovir 400 mg three times daily until delivery to prevent recurrence. On the 12th day of hospitalization, she was discharged home without needing a biopsy anymore and with complete resolution of symptoms and improvement of liver enzymes and AKI; AST 72, ALT 208, alkaline phosphatase 150, total bilirubin 0.5 and creatinine 0.5. She remained symptom-free with complete normalization of creatinine and liver enzymes at outpatient follow-up two weeks after discharge. She was eventually delivered of a healthy baby boy via cesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation with no peripartum complications.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 57-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with chest pain followed by loss of consciousness. It was stated that loss of consciousness was not related to the patient’s position, and according to the eyewitness’ statement, the patient’s eyes were open at that time. Episodes lasted for approximately 2–3 min. During the episode, fecal and urinary incontinence, tongue-biting, and tonic–clonic seizures were not observed. The medical history revealed that the patient was taking 5 mg amlodipine and 50 mg metoprolol succinate due to hypertension; there was no history of alcohol or cigarette consumption. The patient was then hospitalized and admitted to the cardiology department. Sinus bradycardia (45/min) was detected on electrocardiogram (ECG) at admission, and the patient’s blood pressure was 165/63 mmHg. Then, beta blocker treatment was stopped. There were also no electrolyte disturbances on admission. No other pathology except sinus bradycardia was detected during 24-h ambulatory rhythm monitoring. On the third day of hospitalization, ST segment elevation at DII-DIII as well as aVF derivations and complete atrioventricular (AV) block were detected on ECG (). Emergency coronary angiography was performed, and diffuse spasm was detected at the left anterior descending, circumflex, and right coronary arteries (). After intracoronary administration of 300 mcg nitrate, vasospasm disappeared and ST elevation and AV block regressed (Figs. , ). Because the patient had bradycardia, diffuse spasm, and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia during ischemic episodes, dual implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was implanted. Then, 50 mg isosorbid 5-mononitrate and 90 mg diltiazem 2×1 po treatment was initiated. Episodes of syncope continued, and ventricular fibrillation reoccurred during an ischemic episode because of vasospasm. During follow-up, the diltiazem dose was increased up to 480 mg, and episodes were taken under control. In the sixth-month follow-up, the patient had no complaints of angina and syncope and his vasospastic episodes were under control with treatment.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 38-year-old married female without any past or family history of psychiatric or neurological illness and with good premorbid functioning. She was harboring delusion of infidelity against her husband along with disturbed socio-occupational and biological functioning for the past 6 years. There was no history of substance use disorders, except excessive caffeine use, or any high risk sexual behavior. Organic psychiatric disorder or symptoms of schizophrenia were not evident. Detailed general physical examination including neurological evaluation did not reveal any abnormality except mild pallor. She reported regular menstruation and the last childbirth was 10 years back. Mental status examination revealed that she was having an uncooperative and aggressive attitude, delusion of infidelity, impaired judgment, and lack of insight. So, she was admitted to psychiatry ward with a diagnosis of persistent delusional disorder as per International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition. She was started on intramuscular olanzapine 10 mg/day. On investigation, her complete hemogram revealed a Hb of 11.5 gms/dL and a serum ferritin level of 30.2 ngm/ml (normal value for females is 10-291 ng/mL). Other routine hematological and biochemical parameters including blood sugar, renal, liver, and thyroid function were within normal limits. We also planned a vitamin B12 and folic acid estimation which could not be done due to lack of resources.
Within 4-5 days of starting olanzapine, there was a decrease in her aggression and she became cooperative for interviewing. However, she would report that she was having sleeping difficulty due to an itching sensation in both upper and lower limbs at night. She would rub her legs against bedclothes, tie pieces of cloth around her limbs, and ask for limb massage to get relief from such a discomfort. She would have such symptoms for hours after lying down at night. During daytime, she would, however, feel comfortable, relaxed, and was able to sleep. She was evaluated for sleep disorder-before this she never had any sleep complaint, neither was there any family history of sleep disorder. During sleep, there was no history of snoring, no abnormal limb or breathing movements. Ear, nose, throat examination was also noncontributory. She was having a thin built and a body mass index of 15.56. As she became cooperative, she was shifted to oral psychotropics (olanzapine 15 mg/day + clonazepam 1 mg at bedtime). Also oral iron supplementation in the form of ferrous fumarate 350 mg, vitamin B12, and ascorbic acid was started. To improve her sleep, general sleep hygiene practices were initiated, she was prohibited from taking any caffeine beverages at night and the clonazepam was further increased up to 2 mg at bedtime. But there was no improvement in her nighttime symptoms.
In view of her above symptoms and investigations, she was diagnosed to have RLS with an International Restless Legs Scale Score (IRLS) of 24 indicating high severity and olanzapine was considered to be the probable cause. Hence, the olanzapine was decreased to 10 mg/day and oral risperidone 2 mg was added at bedtime. On the next day, the severity of symptoms decreased to a RLS score of 12. No other change in medication was done during this period. So, after 2 days, olanzapine was stopped and risperidone was increased to 6 mg at bedtime. Thereafter, her troublesome symptoms ceased completely. Though she still harbored the delusions yet the conviction decreased and she became more cooperative with her husband and the treating clinician. Then after about a week of uneventful ward stay, she was discharged free of her sleep-related difficulties on risperidone 6 mg and clonazepam 1 mg at bedtime with the plan to continue her antipsychotic drugs and iron supplementation on an outpatient basis.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 64-year-old man visited Jichi Medical University Hospital complaining of left eye visual loss and floaters in the right eye. He was referred to us by the Department of Allergy and Rheumatism of our hospital, having been administrated 40 mg of oral prednisolone for more than 6 weeks as treatment for interstitial pneumonia accompanying rheumatoid arthritis. His medical history included metastatic rectal cancer, intestinal obstruction, and pericarditis.
Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20 in the right eye and 8/200 in the left eye. Funduscopy revealed round yellowish-white subretinal lesions with retinal hemorrhage in both eyes ().
Laboratory studies showed elevated titers of the anti-Toxoplasma, anti-Herpes simplex virus IgG, anti-Herpes simplex virus IgM, and anti-cytomegalovirus IgG antibodies, as well as low cell lymphocyte and CD4-positive lymphocyte counts. In contrast, the white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and β-D glucan levels were not increased.
No abnormalities were noted on blood culture or whole-body contrast computed tomography.
Administration of oral anti-Toxoplasma (acetylspiramycin 1,800 mg/day) and anti-viral drugs (valganciclovir 1,800 mg/day) was initiated. However, the lesions expanded in both eyes.
Diagnostic vitrectomy of the left eye was performed 4 weeks after the initial examination. Although the vitreous fluid sample was subjected to broad-range PCR, multiplex PCR, and other culture tests, no positive results were obtained.
Based on the fundus findings, broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment (imipenem/cilastatin 2,000 mg/day and amikacin 600 mg/day) was initiated, under suspicion of bacterial infections including Nocardia. However, the lesions did not improve. Thus, antibiotics (ceftazidime 2 mg, vancomycin 1 mg, and voriconazole 0.05 mg/0.1 mL each) were injected into the vitreous cavity 6 weeks after the initial examination, and a vitreous tap was simultaneously performed. Broad-range PCR of the vitreous fluid showed 3.75×104 copies/mL of bacterial 16s ribosomal RNA, strongly suggesting bacterial infection. Albeit with antibiotic treatment, the lesions further deteriorated BCVA to light perception ().
Seven weeks after the initial examination, exenteration of the left eye was performed. Immediately after the operation, microscopic observation of the removed and then Gram-stained tissue revealed Gram-negative rods. However, no bacteria corresponding to these organisms grew in culture of either the removed tissue or vitreous fluid, and only C. albicans was isolated. Sheep blood agar and chocolate agar were used for culture and intubated with 5% carbon dioxide at 35°C for 48 hours. The picture of the Gram-stained sample was taken from this culture (, left). Then, the colonies grown on these cultures were harvested and cultivated on the CHROMagar® for identification. The picture of the agar plate shows the colonies that are green in color on the CHROMagar® suggesting the species of C. albicans based on its color (, right).
Based on these findings, mixed bacterial and fungal infection was considered, and simultaneous systemic administrations of antibiotics (levofloxacin 500 mg/day) and maximum-dose antifungal agent (fosfluconazole 600 mg/day) were initiated. In addition, antibiotics (ceftazidime 2 mg, vancomycin 1 mg, and voriconazole 0.05 mg/0.1 mL each) were injected into the vitreous cavity of the right eye three times from 8 weeks to 10 weeks after the initial examination. Broad-range PCR of the vitreous fluid obtained from simultaneous vitreous tap 8 weeks after the initial examination revealed 7.19×104 copies/mL of bacterial 16s ribosomal RNA, and 1.85×105 copies/mL of fungal 28s ribosomal RNA, suggesting a fungus-dominant mixed infection.
The subretinal abscess in the right eye expanded, approaching the central fovea (), and BCVA decreased to 2/200. Vitrectomy combined with cataract surgery and silicone oil injection was performed 10 weeks after the initial examination. C. albicans was detected by vitreous fluid culture. Systemic administration of the antifungal agent was continued after surgery, and the lesions healed under silicone oil (). The fundus had stabilized 1 year and 4 months after the initial examination, and BCVA was maintained at 4/200.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"In 2010, a 68-year-old woman was diagnosed with an abdominal-metastatic grade 3 RCC. Following total nephrectomy, the patient was treated with sunitinib from March to June 2010. Due to poor hepatic tolerance and tumor progression, the patient was switched to everolimus. Unfortunately, in the months following the second-line treatment initiation, she was diagnosed with everolimus-related bilateral interstitial pneumonia, requesting for urgent everolimus discontinuation. A third-line treatment based on sorafenib was initiated in January 2011. Despite immediate grade 1 abdominal, facial and truncal rash, sorafenib was continued at 200 mg twice a day. Twelve days later, the patient reported grade 3 dysesthesia of the whole scalp, negatively affecting her quality of life. The differential diagnosis of migraine was rejected by neurologists, and first-line migraine treatments did not improve dysesthesia. Sorafenib was stopped 15 days after the onset of dysesthesia and when the symptoms intensified. Sorafenib discontinuation resulted in a complete dysesthesia resolution in the following days.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 50-year-old woman presented to the Breast Unit of Sant’ Anna and San Sebastiano Hospital of Caserta, Italy, after becoming aware of a non-tender lump in the median areolar area of her right breast. She first noticed the mass one month previously. During this period, she did not have any pain or discharge from the nipple. Further, she had no family history of malignancy, including breast cancer. She was in antihypertensive therapy.
She had never undergone any radiation and hormone replacement therapy. On physical examination, the patient had a demarcated, mobile, firm and fast-growing mass in her right breast.
The mass was not tender, approximately 4 cm in diameter, and was detected in the median areolar area of the right breast. There was no clinical evidence of regional lymphadenopathy.
Mammography revealed an opaque and ovoid lesion occupying the median equatorial region of the right breast; this lesion was 35 mm in diameter, with regular margins, moderate intensity and homogeneous density; there was no evidence of defined focus of pathological calcification (Figure ). Ultrasonography revealed a bulky, firm, hypoechoic lesion, with blurred and irregular margins, richly vascularized on color Doppler, with high speed systolic flow. This mass was 45 mm in diameter, and referred to as a heteroplastic lesion. There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy.
Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration on the lesion showed epithelioid and spindle cells, which were positive only to the immunohistochemical staining for vimentin and so we suspected a mesenchymal lesion.
An ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy performed subsequently showed connective tissue, including cells similar to those already present in the needle aspirate and there were many multinuclear osteoclast-like giant cells. The immunohistochemical staining confirmed the mesenchymal nature of the lesion (positivity for vimentin), but did not indicate clearly a specific histotype for the actin, CD34 and S100 protein negativity.
Preoperative examination consisted of a complete blood count, serum kidney and liver function, thyroid function test, and tests for the levels of several hormones related to the development of gynecomastia, including estrogen, testosterone, prolactin and gonadotrophic hormones as well as cancer markers (CEA, CA 15–3, CA 125). Ultrasound (US) of the abdomen failed to document any abnormalities. An isotope bone scan did not reveal any abnormal uptake. All results were within the normal limits.
The patient underwent total mastectomy without axillary lymph node dissection, awaiting histology.
Macroscopic examination of the specimen, measuring 19 × 15 × 8 cm and including the normal nipple, revealed a grayish, apparently delimited nodular lesion, measuring 10 cm in diameter, with cystic-necrotic and few hemorrhagic areas. The lesion was 0.5 cm away from the fascia and 1 cm away from the skin; furthermore, another grayish nodular lesion measuring 1.5 cm was in the subcutaneous tissue.
Microscopic examination of the sections from the specimen showed nodular proliferation of pleomorphic-spindle-shaped and ovoid cells, with connective tissue septa, mixed with many multinuclear osteoclast-like giant cells that did not show, mainly, malignant features (Figures a-b; Figure a, b).
Necrotic areas and abnormal mitosis were identified. Immunohistochemical stainings for Cytokeratin Pan (Figure a), Cytokeratin 7-8-18-19, EMA (epithelial membrane antigen), S100 protein, SMA (smooth muscle actin) and CD34 were negative; immunohistochemical staining for vimentin was positive (Figure b). Mitotic activity was observed with a high proliferation index, assessed with Ki67. Moreover, in the surrounding parenchymal component, there were multiple foci of intraductal carcinoma, evaluated with immunohistochemical staining for muscle actin and collagen IV. The lesion was contained within the margins of excision.
The histological and immunohistochemical findings established the diagnosis of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with osteoclast-like giant cells of the breast.
The patient was monitored after the operation and we did not consider that adjuvant treatment was necessary in the presence of adequate local control and in the absence of metastatic spread of the disease. Follow-up mammography has been satisfactory to date, and she remained well without tumor recurrence at 15 months.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 7-year-old girl presented with a 2-week history of shoulder-tip pain, progressive fever and right upper quadrant pain. She had no history of vomiting, diarrhea or weight loss.
On examination, she was febrile and had a palpable, firm mass in the right upper quadrant. She had a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 145/min and respiratory rate of 28/ min. Blood culture was negative and did not grow any organism. Serology for cytomegalovirus (CMV), Ebstein-Barr virus, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C and hydatid was negative. Serum α-fetoprotein levels of 0 and serum HCG <2 were recorded.
USG of the abdomen [] showed a large, mixed, complex solid-cystic lesion, which was predominantly a solid lesion with a heterogenous cystic component, within the right lobe of the liver with no flow or increased vascularity on color Doppler examination. CT scan revealed a well-defined, solitary, cyst-like hepatic mass []. No definite solid mass-like component, enhancing nodule or calcification/fat was appreciated. A few hyperdense areas were seen within this cystic-looking lesion. No vascular compromise or invasion was seen. No contrast enhancement was seen. Subsequently, an MRI of the abdomen was also performed [], which revealed the hepatic lesion to be predominantly hyperintense on the T2W images, but with central areas of low signal intensity. The T1W axial images [] revealed the lesion to be iso to heterogeneously hypointense and did not show any enhancement after intravenous contrast administration []. There was thus a discordance between the predominantly solid appearance on USG and the predominantly cystic appearance on CT scan and MRI.
She underwent surgical biopsy. Immunohistochemistry was performed, which revealed that tumor cells were positive for α-1-antitrypsin and α-1-antichymotrypsin and some cells were also positive for cytokeratosis. No positivity was seen for CD10 or desmin. Several CD68-positive macrophages were found. The myxoid morphology of the lesions, the presence of eosinophilic hyaline bodies and the immunohistochemical spectrum were typical for UES of the liver []. Rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation was not seen. Based on these findings, we arrived at a final diagnosis of UES of the liver.
This patient is presently on chemotherapy (ifosfamide, doxorubicin and ondansetron) and follow-up imaging (CT scan) has revealed mild reduction in size. Future plans include surgery, if feasible, followed by radiation and postoperative chemotherapy. This is the currently accepted clinical practice.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 63-year-old Caucasian male presented with a one-week history of uncontrolled choreiform movements of his left upper extremity. As described by the patient, his left arm began “jerking uncontrollably out of nowhere” while working in his shed at home. Prior to this development, the patient stated he had one similar episode a year ago which lasted for two days and resolved spontaneously. He did not seek evaluation at that time. His past medical history consisted of uncontrolled insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension, schizoaffective disorder, and polysubstance abuse in remission. He reported having diabetes mellitus for at least 10 years. Reviewing the medical records, his previous HbA1C readings ranged from 13.8% to 12.4% over a 12-month span prior to his admission. His average blood sugar readings over this time ranged from 300 to 350 mg/dl. BMI was 25.3 kg/m2. His home insulin regimen included 10 units of NovoLog three times a day with meals and Lantus 20 units every morning. He was not on any oral diabetic medications. The patient reported that he was not compliant with his home insulin medications. Notably for comparison, an MRI brain performed 5 months before for a fall did not reveal any abnormalities. He denied any recent medication changes, illnesses, or headaches. His ESR and CRP were elevated, and his initial glucose level was 339 mg/dl. HbA1C was 9.9% on the day of his admission. Vital signs were normal upon presentation, and physical exam was benign aside from the hemichorea movements of the left upper extremity. Our differential diagnosis included neoplastic disorders (metastatic brain disease and brain tumor), Huntington's disease, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, trauma, and drug or chemical toxicity (dopamine agonist or phenytoin). CT scan of the head showed areas of high density in the right lenticular nucleus and right caudate head. Subsequent precontrast MRI demonstrated T1 and T2 hyperintense abnormalities in the caudate nucleus portion of the right basal ganglia (). Postcontrast MRI of the brain showed no abnormal enhancement excluding the possibility of a mass lesion (). Diffusion-weighted MRI brain images did not reveal any abnormal restricted diffusion in the right basal ganglia which excluded ischemia (). All of these changes were consistent with the movement pattern he was displaying and with a diagnosis of CHBG. Other conditions that have been known to cause hyperintense imaging abnormalities on MRI such as this include various cellular respiratory toxins such as carbon monoxide, methanol, and cyanide. Leigh disease and hyperammonemia from chronic cirrhosis have also been known to cause this. Our patient did not have any history that would correlate with these alternative possibilities, and additionally, none of these alternatives have been known to present with hemichorea. Inpatient treatment consisted of restarting the patient's home insulin regimen with the addition of inpatient corrective coverage. This included Lantus 20 units every morning and 10 units of NovoLog 3 times a day with meals. The patient's symptoms eventually resolved with control of his blood sugar levels. Control was achieved over roughly 48 hours during which our patient's blood glucose levels dropped from an average of mid-300s to the 170–200 mg/dl range. The choreoathetosis progressed from continuous movements to intermittent and then finally to resolution.
Endocrinology was consulted for assistance with the patient's difficult glycemic control. During his posthospitalization outpatient course, our patient began to consistently adhere to his outpatient diabetic medications. Lantus was increased to 40 units every morning and NovoLog was increased 13 units 3 times a day with meals. His HbA1C 6 months after discharge had improved to 7.1%. There were no further occurrences of choreiform movements. This time course of events demonstrates how treatment of hyperglycemia can adequately treat and lead to complete resolution of hemichorea-hemiballismic movements in patients with CHBG. In this case, symptomatic improvement began being observed 48 hours after initiation of glucose control.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 66-year-old man, affected by type II DM for 4 years and arterial hypertension for 10 years, developed severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy without macular edema just 2 years after DM diagnosis. The patient was treated with panretinal photocoagulation (PRP), because he had a poor glycometabolic control and was unable to adhere to a close follow-up. One year after PRP, he developed severe visual loss due to diffuse non tractional bilateral DME. Thus, the two eyes were treated with an IV triamcinolone injection 1 month apart (the right eye [RE] before the left eye [LE]) and laser grid photocoagulation was performed in both eyes 2 weeks after IV injection. After no visual recovery for over 2 months due to the persistence of macular edema in both eyes, an IV injection of bevacizumab was given in the RE, where a larger amount of intraretinal fluid and subfoveal neural detachment were observed. However, 1 week after the injection, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) with a residual visual acuity of hand motion was observed. During the entire period, the patient had poor glycometabolic control (glycated hemoglobin >9%, high hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia) and poor adherence to therapy. This fact could have influenced the patient’s poor response to therapy and the development of AION.
As a result of this unfortunate adverse event, the patient refused an IV injection of bevacizumab in his LE. After informing the patient about the risks and benefits of different treatment options such as observation, off-label IV injections of steroids, and subtenon injections of IFNα, the patient signed an informed consent for a cycle of subtenon injections of IFNα.
Before the treatment, the BCVA in the LE was 20/200. The patient received posterior subtenon injections of IFNα (1×106 IU/ml) three times (on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for a week in his LE, according to the following procedure: after the administration of topical 0.4% oxybuprocaine surface anesthesia, 1 ml of IFNα was slowly injected into the inferotemporal quadrant under the Tenon’s capsule, using a 27-gauge needle on a 2.5-ml syringe. The needle was moved toward the macular area, until the hub was firmly pressed against the conjunctival fornix. After the first injection, topical 0.3% netilmicin eye drops were prescribed three times a day for 7 days. During the period of IFN-α therapy, the patient had a good systemic condition and a good glycometabolic control (glycated hemoglobin = 6.9%).
A complete ophthalmic examination including BCVA, indirect ophthalmoscopy, and SD-OCT of the macular region was conducted several times throughout the period of IV injection and laser grid therapy and, specifically, preoperatively, as well as at 1 week, 1 month, 4 months, and 1 year after the last injection of INFα. SD-OCT images were obtained using Spectralis OCT spectral-domain (Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) and the baseline macular scan was set as the reference (Figure 
). Fifteen months after the treatment, the BCVA in the LE was 20/40, with reduced cystoid macular edema but the SD-OCT highlighted the persistence of the photoreceptor inner segment/outer segment (IS/OS) disruption already highlighted at the baseline (Figure 
). The patient gives his written consent for the use of his data and any accompanying images.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"Twenty three year-old female was complained of mouth opening limitation, TMJ pain and sound. The mouth opening at initial examination was 32 mm (Fig. ). The patient has suffered from this problem, and experienced arthrocentesis before. Under diagnosing to chronic closed lock on both TMJ and anterior disk displacement without reduction in MRI (Fig. ), ultra-thin arthroscopic diagnosis and arthrocentesis was performed, and the adhesion was removed with trocar through the portal of Chung's needle (Figs. , ). After arthrocentesis, range of mouth opening was 45 mm, and symptom was disappeared (Fig. ).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 69-year-old male with underlying hypertension was admitted with a complaint of general weakness started 10 days ago. The patient had been taking irbesartan 150 mg and thiazide 12.5 mg for 3 years. He had 20 pack-year history of smoking. The initial blood pressure was 128/82 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the temperature was 36℃. Chest auscultation revealed decreased breathing sound on the left upper area of chest wall.
Laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count, 8,190×109/L; hemoglobin, 16.4 g/dL; platelet count, 170×109/L; glucose level, 235 mg/dL; sodium, 141 mEq/L; potassium, 1.7 mEq/L; chloride, 88 mEq/L; lactic dehydrogenase, 863 U/L; D-dimer, 0.08 µg/L; and C-reactive peptide, 2.30 mg/L. Arterial blood gas analysis was pH 7.574, pCO2 50.1 mm Hg, pO2 122 mmHg, HCO3 40 mmol/L, and oxygen saturation was 98.8% suggesting metabolic alkalosis.
The chest radiography taken on admission showed left upper lobe atelectasis and mass like lesion infiltrating the left upper bronchus (). Chest computed tomography (CT) scans revealed about 7×5-cm-sized mass in left upper lobe showing invasion to the main pulmonary arterial trunk (). Biopsy was done with bronchoscopy and the pathology confirmed small cell carcinoma. Positron emission tomography CT showed hepatic and both adrenal gland metastases.
Our primary impression was hyperaldosteronism or pseudohyperaldosteronism according to the lab finding of hypokalemia associated with hypertension. Aldosterone and renin level being normal, hypokalemia with metabolic alkalosis in patient with lung cancer infiltrating left upper lobe suggested Cushing syndrome due to ectopic ACTH secreting tumor. The ACTH level was elevated to 535.61 pg/mL and the cortisol level was elevated to 47.43 µg/dL. The level of cortisol was not suppressed with low dose and high dose dexamethasone suppression test and the 24-hour urinary free cortisol was still elevated to 1,796.93 µg/day. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed normal pituitary gland and no cerebral metastases. The malignant tissue obtained with bronchoscopy was positive in ACTH marker stain. These finding were consistent with Cushing syndrome caused by ectopic ACTH production (). The patient had no cushingoid appearance such as moon face, skin change or central obesity, and hypokalemia was the only clinical feature to suspect diagnosis.
To reduce the high cortisol level before chemotherapy, ketoconazole (400 mg two times a day) and spironolactone were administered for EAS. As hypokalemia resolved, so did the metabolic alkalosis. It was not needed to maintain corticosteroid treatment after normalization of hypokalemia. Once ectopic ACTH production controlled, the patient was transferred to the oncology division to have systemic chemotherapy and survived for 15 months.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 49-year-old woman hospitalized at the Department of Plastic and Maxillofacial Surgery, presented with a growing mass in her left maxillary hard palate dating 2 months back. She was diagnosed with an oral ulcer at a local clinic, and received antibiotics. However, the symptoms did not improve; the mass became bigger and painful. Her past medical history was unremarkable without any systemic disease. No obvious physical findings were noted during general examination. She had no bouts of fever, chills, night sweats, vomiting, or weight loss. The intraoral examination revealed that there was a mass measuring 3.0 cm × 2.0 cm in size, with ulcerated surface mucosa in the left maxillary hard palate (Fig. ).
To obtain a definitive diagnosis, an incisional biopsy of the oral mass was performed under local anesthesia. Histologic examination using hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed that there was diffuse cell infiltration growth. Most cells were large, with vacuolated nuclei, obvious nucleoli and a basophilic cytoplasm containing granules (Fig. ). For the final diagnosis, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed, and the tumor cells tested positive for MPO, CD4, BCL-2, KI-67 (Fig. ), and CD117 and negative for CD3, CD5, CD20, CD56, bcl-6, Mum-1, CD123, MUM-1, TdT, Syn, SOX11, and C-myc. These results supported the diagnosis of GS.
The patient was then referred to the Hematology Department. Bone marrow aspiration was negative for malignant cells, and the laboratory test results revealed only monocytosis. Standard bone marrow cytogenetic analysis showed a normal karyotype and leukemia-related fusion gene detection was normal. Therefore, according to IHC and bone marrow aspiration results in combination with morphological features, the final diagnosis was intraoral primary GS.
A chemotherapy regimen comprising idarubicin 8 mg VD d1–3 and cytarabine arabinoside 150 mg VD d1–7 idarubicin and cytarabine arabinoside was initiated. During chemotherapy, the patient only appeared mild nausea, vomiting and canker sores (grade II). These symptoms gradually eased without special therapy. After 2 cycles of idarubicin and cytarabine arabinoside regimen chemotherapy, the patient achieved complete remission. The tumor was barely visible in the left maxillary hard palate (Fig. ). The patient denied consolidation therapy or bone marrow transplant. Nevertheless, there has been no evidence of disease spread and progression after 1 year of follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 15-year-old male patient visited the clinic due to erythematous lesions on the face, neck, and elbow. He suffered from atopic dermatitis from infancy which had been more aggravated during the last year. He received standard treatment with persistent fluctuation. His clinical severity was improved from 29 to 16.5 (points) after 24 Histobulin injections. The laboratory and skin test results before and after treatment are shown in Figure . The severity score of atopic dermatitis was improved gradually with 24 Histobulin injections. The results of the MAST showed 10 positive allergens (Dp 100<, Df 100<, milk 1.0, Cladosporium 0.69, ragweed short 6.95, Bermuda grass 0.79, orchard grass 2.49, timothy grass 0.36, P notatum 0.56, and Japanese cedar 14.19) before treatment, and 9 allergens were positive (Dp 100<, Df 100<, C herbarum 0.65, ragweed short 1.37, Bermuda grass 1.30, orchard grass 2.85, reed 0.64, P notatum 0.57, and Japanese cedar 5.14) after treatment.

"The case we present here is about a 40-year-old man who was referred to our pain clinic with severe ischemic pain of right lower limb. The pain started gradually 10 months back and became very severe for the last 1 month. The intensity of pain was increasing in both the sitting and lying down positions and decreasing in a standing position. Many non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were tried earlier without much benefit. Over the last 1 month, the severity of the pain was so bad that the patient had to stand all the time and sitting or decubitus position was not tolerable even for 1 min. His sleep was so miserable that he had been taking small naps in that standing position leaning onto some support. He had carcinoma rectum for which he underwent abdominoperineal resection 8 years ago. There was history of smoking prior to that. After the surgery, he had been leading a near normal life driving auto rickshaw for a living until he developed the present problem. There were many gangrenous ulcers over his right thigh and leg. A computed tomography-angiogram was done previously that showed a thrombus in the right common iliac artery measuring about 9.5 cm extending up to the right superficial femoral artery with a near total occlusion of the lumen and poorly developed collaterals. He was scheduled for a conventional peripheral angiogram for deciding on the further plan. However, he could not lie down in the catheterization laboratory due to severe pain and was referred to our Department of Pain Management. We initially tried a conservative approach with a combination of oral pregabalin, diclofenac, paracetamol, and tramadol as per the standard dosage protocol for 2 days. When there was no satisfactory pain relief, we planned epidural analgesia. However, the problem here was the positioning. Patient was not able to tolerate either sitting or lateral decubitus position even for 1 min. He was somewhat comfortable only in the standing position. Considering the special situation, though not conventional, we decided to place the epidural catheter in that standing position. An intravenous line was started using an 18G venous cannula. Electrocardiogram, pulse oximeter, and non-invasive blood pressure monitors were connected. Patient was made to stand besides the operating table holding on to it for support. He was also supported by a technician from the front []. After painting and draping the back, L 4-5 inter-space was identified and local anesthesia was given with 2% lidocaine. Epidural space was engaged with 18G Tuohy needle using loss of resistance to air technique. The epidural catheter was carefully threaded and placed such that the length of the catheter was 5 cm in the epidural space. Catheter was gently aspirated to check for blood and cerebro-spinal fluid and was fixed after subcutaneous tunneling for about 5 cm []. Patient was reassured and gently placed on the operating table in the supine position. A quick test dose was given with 3 ml of 2% lidocaine with 15 mcg adrenaline confirming the epidural placement followed by a bolus of 10 ml of 1% lidocaine along with 1 ml of 7.5% sodium bicarbonate. The pain was relieved within 1 min and the vital signs were stable. Epidural infusion was maintained thereafter with a solution of 0.125% bupivacaine and dexmedetomidine 2 mcg/ml at the rate of 5 ml/h. Patient was very comfortable and slept peacefully. Next day peripheral angiogram was performed, which confirmed the findings of CT-angiogram. Balloon angioplasty was attempted after 2 days, but was not successful and an above knee amputation was performed subsequently. Epidural catheter was removed after 2 days and further pain control was achieved satisfactorily with oral medications.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"An 8 days old exclusively breastfed female infant was referred to our hospital because of an infection of the umbilicus without fever. She was the second child of nonconsanguineous parents, both of Arab-Berber descent, born after 39 weeks of pregnancy, complicated by intrauterine growth restriction. Birth weight 2.570 kg (SD –1.6), length 48 cm (SD –0.8), and head circumference 32 cm (SD –1.7). The mother was known to have Crohn’s disease, treated with oral methylprednisolone, in a gradually reducing dose with a maximum of 32 mg daily, and adalimumab, 40 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks for up to 3 months before delivery. Additional investigations revealed a latent tuberculosis (positive interferon gamma release assay), for which she used INH 300 mg once a day, in combination with pyridoxine 125 mg, which both were started immediately after delivery. Family history is negative for hematologic diseases, syndromes, or early unexplained death.
Physical examination of the neonate was, besides a local infection of the umbilicus, normal for her age. No (skeletal) malformations, cutaneous, or nail abnormalities; hepato-splenomegaly; or hypotonia were noted. However, complete blood count showed a picture of severe isolated neutropenia (hemoglobin 18.2 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume 97, plate-lets 254×109/L, leukocytes 7.56×109/L, and absolute neutrophil count [ANC] 0.04×109/L; C-reactive protein 73.1 mg/L). The child was admitted and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic treatment (ampicillin and cefotaxime) was started. Cultures of the umbilicus revealed the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. Urine and blood cultures remained negative.
The infection improved; however, the isolated neutropenia persisted. No viral etiology (TORCH, which includes Toxoplasmosis, Other [syphilis, varicella-zoster, parvovirus B19], Rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes infections, [para] influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus) could be demonstrated. Testing for antineutrophil antibodies was not done, as the tests often show false-positive and false-negative results. Bone marrow aspiration revealed a severe dysgranulopoiesis, characterized by a maturation stop after meta-/myelocyte stage (), indicating severe congenital neutropenia. Maternal usage of adalimumab during pregnancy can cause neutropenia because it can cross the placenta from the maternal circulation into the fetal circula tion. Also, agranulocytosis due to INH, used by the mother while breast-feeding, could not be excluded. Tuberculosis was excluded in the child, and the complete blood count of the mother did not show neutropenia. As a probability scale, we use the Naranjo algorithm, and this case was scored for both medications separately. INH was scored “3,” while adalimumab was scored “4,” both as a “possible” likelihood to be responsible for the neutropenia (Naranjo scores: 9 or 10 indicate “definitely”; 5–8 rate the likelihood as “probable”; 1–4 “possible”; <1 “doubtful”).
Breast-feeding was terminated, and filgrastim (Neupogen®, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) 5 µg/kg subcutaneously was started. A very slow increase of ANC was seen, and so filgrastim dose was increased to 10 µg/kg subcutaneously, with good improvement. ANC increased to a maximum of 35.85×109/L. Two months after birth, filgrastim was terminated which, initially, led to a decrease of ANC, before it stabilized in the normal range (). Two weeks after terminating, the filgrastim a new bone marrow aspiration () and a complete blood count was repeated. Both were normal, which excluded severe congenital neutropenia.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

The patient had two healthy births after IVIG treatment. Preoperatively, dextrocardia was detected on an electrocardiogram and thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) showed situs inversus totalis. In addition to mirror imaging of the normal anatomic locations of all organs, the spleen measured 13 × 6 cm and there was a 1.5 cm accessory spleen in the right upper quadrant (). Although no abnormalities were seen in the head and body of the pancreas, no pancreatic tail was seen. In other words, the pancreas had not crossed over to the right side of the superior mesenteric vascular axis and there was no pancreatic tissue near the splenic hilum ().

"A 52-year-old female presented with a lung nodule in the right lower lobe one year after living related donor kidney transplant (KT) for nail-patella syndrome in February 2020. Her post-KT course was uncomplicated, and her immunosuppressive regimen was based on tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroid. On a routine CT scan, a solitary pulmonary nodule with a small satellite lesion was accidentally found at 2 months post-KT (a). A positron emission tomography (PET) revealed high 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose-avidity with a value of standardized uptake value (SUV) of 12.3. The patient did not show any respiratory symptoms and the physical examination and laboratory results were unremarkable. Blood cultures were not performed as the patient was afebrile and the main diagnostic hypothesis was the neoplastic disease. To rule out a malignant aetiology, a CT guided transthoracic needle biopsy was performed. Histologic analysis of the specimen found granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells containing oval forms positive on PAS and Grocott staining. After deparaffination of the tissue section, we performed PCR 18S-RNA-sequencing. 18S-sequencing analysis was most consistent with the genus and species Malassezia restricta. After three-month antifungal therapy with itraconazole, a follow up CT scan showed a complete resolution of the lung nodule (b). Due to pharmacokinetic interaction between itraconazole and calcineurin inhibitors, frequent adjustments of tacrolimus dosage were needed based on through levels (max 19 ng/mL–min 7.1 ng/mL) to avoid nefrotoxicity. Renal function remained constant without any rise of creatinine levels.

"A 14-year-old boy sustained a direct impact to his left shoulder due to an ice-hockey body-check. He complained acute pain and loss of function of his left shoulder. Initially the shoulder was immobilized in a shoulder sling and the patient was introduced to our department for shoulder and elbow surgery 10 days after the injury. Clinically, he presented with a prominent left acromioclavicular (AC) joint with pain on horizontal and vertical manipulation of the lateral clavicle, as well as marked tenderness over the coracoid process. Functional evaluation of the AC joint revealed a moderate superoinferior (3-5 mm) but no anteroposterior instability. Active range of motion (ROM) was restricted in every direction [ab-/adduction (Abd/Add): 50-0-10°; flexion/extension (F/E): 60-0-30°; external/internal rotation (ER/IR): 40-0-85°], passive ROM was normal. There was no evidence for an injury of brachial plexus or vascular compromise. The patient’s demands were complete and fast recovery with return to full sports as soon as possible, since he was playing ice-hockey in a first league team.
Computed tomography (CT) showed an AC joint separation with elevation of the lateral clavicle of 5 mm () and a fracture at the epiphysis of the coracoid base with 3 mm dislocation medially (). The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an AC joint sprain with intact AC capsule and ligaments as well as intact coracoclavicular ligaments (CCL) ().
We started non-operative treatment on first presentation with immobilization in a Camo®Shoulder brace (OPED, Valley/Oberlaindern, Germany). This device allows resting of the 90° flexed elbow on a pad, thereby partially unloading the shoulder girdle, with fixed abduction of 15° and internal rotation of 45° (). At clinical and radiological follow-up 2 weeks later, the patient presented with persisting tenderness over the coracoid process but less tenderness over the AC joint. Active ROM was still markedly restricted (Abd/Add: 60-0-10°; F/E: 60-0-30°; ER/IR: 40-0-80°). The radiographs ruled out a secondary dislocation of the coracoid process. Passive rotation of the shoulder within the dynamic brace was allowed between 30 and 60° IR from week 4 and between 20 to 80° IR from week 5 (). At 8 weeks follow-up the patient presented completely pain-free with full ROM () and without tenderness on palpation over the coracoid or the AC joint. Clinical tests for the AC joint, rotator cuff and long biceps tendon revealed to be normal. After week 8 the patient resumed ice-hockey training and regained sports activity on first league level after 12 weeks. After 5 months he presented with mild symptoms of subcoracoid impingement which was successfully treated with physiotherapy within 6 weeks. A MRI confirmed complete bony healing of the coracoid fracture without malalignement, a coracohumeral distance of 13mm and signs of a mild subcoracoid bursitis (,).","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 53-year-old man transferred 2 days following MI was awake, comfortable on room air, and hemodynamically stable without inotropes. His coronary angiogram revealed subtotal occlusion of LAD, and transthoracic echo showed a VSD 1.3 cm located on the anterior septum with EF 50%. He was scheduled for urgent closure of septal defect and a bypass grafting for LAD after the IABP insertion. General anesthesia was induced with remifentanil and propofol in titrated doses and maintained on midazolam, remifentanil, and propofol infusion with cisatracurium for muscle paralysis. The LAD grafting was performed, and the closure of defect was performed using Dacron patch and the pledgeted sutures to close ventriculotomy. He could be weaned off bypass without inotropes and was extubated on 1st postoperative day. The patient was discharged from intensive care in 48 h, and his remaining postoperative course was free of major complications.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 58-year-old woman experienced sudden deterioration of vision in her right eye, 2 weeks prior to her first visit. The patient negated any other symptoms related to her eyes, including pain and diplopia. The patient had a history of pain-related symptoms in her arms and negated taking any medicines regularly.
An initial eye examination determined BCVA to be 1.0 in her left eye, whereas she was only able to distinguish hand movement in her right eye. No RAPD was evident at this first examination. No proptosis or enophtalmus was present. A fundus examination revealed that both eyes had vital optic discs and normal retinas. Initial laboratory tests revealed a high ESR (22 mm/h), a slightly increased CRP (8 mg/L), and normal HGB and creatinine. The patient negated head pain, scalp tenderness, and jaw pain.
An orbital MRI was carried out 3 weeks after her initial visit and showed a suspected increase in fluid around the distal part of the optical nerve of the right eye, along with increased signaling. The pituitary gland also displayed increased signaling. The results were interpreted as being suggestive of OPN. The patient received a course of prednisone, starting with 60 mg/day for 5 days, 50 mg/day for 10 days, and 40 mg/day until her next appointment 3 months after her initial examination.
At the follow-up, an examination determined BCVA to be 1.3 in her left eye and <0.5 in her right eye. Because of severe side effects, the prednisone was tapered to 5 mg/day at her next visit 6 weeks later. BCVA was determined to be 1.0 in her left eye and 0.5 in her right eye. Color vision was assessed and found to be defective in her right eye (red light seen as pink). Prednisone was tapered out completely during the next 10 days. A new MRI showed increased signaling in the right optic nerve and right nerve sheath.
At a new examination 4 months later (8 months after her first visit), BCVA was unchanged. A visual field test of her right eye revealed a lower arcuate scotoma (Humphrey field test, visual field index [VFI] of 94%). Fundus examination revealed a pale papilla in her right eye compared to the left. The macula appeared to be normal.
A MRI of the sella turcica area and a chest x-ray was conducted. No pathological changes were observed. Further laboratory tests included markers for sarcoidosis (ACE), syphilis (WR, VDRL), and inflammation. Besides a slightly elevated haptoglobin, results did not support any increase in inflammatory activity.
Her symptoms were unchanged at her next ophthalmologic examination 10 months later (one and a half years after her first visit), once again showing a paler papilla in her right eye compared to her left. A RAPD was present in her right eye.
At her last eye examination, 18 months after the initial contact, the optic disc in her right eye was found to be pale and slightly atrophic compared to the left eye. BCVA was unchanged at 1.0 in her left eye and 0.5 in her right eye. RAPD was present.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"Black female patient; nine years and three months old. She had progressive weight
gain and a decrease in growth velocity, which had been observed since the age of
5 years old. Height1.14 m, Z score -3.24 (below the percentile <2.5); weight
37 kg, Z score 1.33 (>P97); Body Mass Index (BMI) 28.6 kg/m2, Z
score 3.2 (>P97); acanthosis nigricans, hypertrichosis, hunch back, globular
abdomen without purplish stretch marks. Developmental stage in puberty according
to the Tanner Scale M3 P5. Bone age of six years and ten months old, with a
chronological age of nine years and three months old. No history of
glucocorticoid use.
Laboratory tests () showed that she
had ­ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism and no apparent pituitary adenoma in three
1.5 MRI studies. Additionally, the patient participated in a dynamic study when
she was 9, 10 and 12 years old. Bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling
(BIPSS) was indicated. The exam was performed three years after the first
consultation, and the result was unclear due to technical problems. At 12 years
of age, the patient was submitted to a 3-RM MRI in the dynamic study. In the
post-contrast (gadolinium) sequence, the sagittal section, and the T1 sequence,
a contrasting hypocaptive image was found. It was located in the adenohypophysis
on the left side’s cavernous sinus. It measured 2.9 × 2.6 × 2.5 mm, which is
compatible with microadenoma ().
Details of this technique can be found in . A transsphenoidal surgery was performed on the patient when she
was 12 years and 11 months old and because she had enough adrenal to be
diagnosed with hypercortisolim, she took prednisone for two years. Even after
she was cured of hipercortisolism, she did not grow enough. Recombinant growth
hormones were then prescribed, even though the growth hormone test was
responsive after glucagon stimulation (). She thus became officially defined as having idiopathic short
stature. The patient’s final height was 1.41 m, which did not reach the family
target of 1.61 m.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 60-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with a complaint of right lower abdominal pain. The patient did not have same symptoms before, and he only had a medical history of asthma. The laboratory data on admission showed a slightly elevated WBC count of 9,300/μl and a CRP level of 1.0 mg/dl, but the tumor marker levels (CEA, CA19-9) were almost within the normal limits. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a 15-cm large cystic mass, like a dilated intestine, and fluid collection was observed inside.
The cystic mass was adhered to the ileum, but there was no definite communication to the ileum. The feeding arteries of the cyst were communicating branches from the upper mesentery artery, and the lymph nodes around the cyst were slightly swollen (Figure a,c). At the small-bowel follow-through exam, the cyst did not come out, but it did exclude normal intestine (Figure b). There were not significant findings during a colonoscopic examination.
Based on these findings, we diagnosed the cyst as an ileal duplication and decided to perform surgery in order to prevent a recurrence of abdominal pain and lethal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.
We employed a four-port laparoscope-assisted resection of the duplicated ileum and segmental resection of the normal ileum. An umbilical port was used for a mini-laparotomy with a zigzag skin incision (Figure a). The cyst’s stalk was attached to the base of the mesentery of the terminal ileum, approximately 40 cm from the ileocecal junction (Figure b,c). After resection of the cyst, a side-to-side anastomosis of the ileum was made with a stapler.
The resected specimen showed an ileal duplication of 18 × 7 cm in diameter, filled with purulent matter with some ulcers inside (Figure a). The histological findings showed that it had a mucus gland inside, like intestinal epithelium, and was covered with two layers of smooth muscle. There was no communication between the duplication and normal ileum, but they had a common muscle layer (Figure b,c).
The postoperative period was uneventful without any asthma attack, and the patient was discharged on the 13th postoperative day.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"The patient is a 16-year-old female with CF (genotype: F508del/W1282X), CF-related diabetes requiring insulin, and CF-related liver disease after liver transplant, who experienced a precipitous decline in lung function over the prior year, requiring frequent- near monthly -hospital admissions for intravenous antibiotics targeting her primary respiratory pathogen, B. multivorans. The patient acquired this pathogen in her sputum six years before, and over time, it developed increasing antibiotic resistance (). Notably, the patient required long-term immunosuppressive therapy following liver transplant 21 months before. Her frequency of hospital admission for pulmonary exacerbations remained unchanged for the first year after liver transplant but doubled in the succeeding 9 months. Her pulmonary exacerbations would only briefly respond to a single antibiotic, intravenous meropenem-vaborbactam. Furthermore, the patient's weight remained stagnant at the 10th percentile.
Female sex, body mass index ≤18 kg/m2, CF-related diabetes requiring insulin, B. cepacia complex infection, and frequent pulmonary exacerbations have all been identified as risk factors for mortality in individuals with CF and low lung function []. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators have been shown to increase lung function and decrease rates of pulmonary exacerbation in individuals with CF [, ]; however, the patient's genotype and history of liver transplantation precluded her from qualifying for any CFTR modulators available at the time or therapeutic trials, respectively. Lung transplantation was discussed though the patient's colonizing pathogen and adolescent age are controversially associated with poorer outcomes [, ].
High-dose inhaled NO administration via a mechanical ventilator fitted with scavenging chambers was reviewed and approved under an institutional process called “Innovative Diagnostics and Therapeutics,” by which independent hospital leadership evaluate novel approaches to the care of individual patients. The patient assented, and her parents provided consent for this therapy.
The patient received a total of 46 intermittent inhalations of 160 ppm NO over a 28-day period during two separate hospital admissions: days 1–12 and days 16–28 (). During the first admission, inhaled NO was given over 30-minute intervals up to three times daily (27 total doses). In the second admission, the treatment interval was gradually increased to 60 minutes, two times daily (19 total doses), starting with 30-minute inhalations up to three times daily (9 doses), transitioned to 45-minute inhalations twice daily (2 doses), and ultimately 60-minute inhalations twice daily (8 doses). She concurrently received intravenous meropenem-vaborbactam (dose: 4 grams every 8 hours) on days 4–10 and 16–28.
The NO gas source was commercially available as 850 ppm nitric oxide in nitrogen tanks that meet the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) traceability protocol requirements (Airgas Inc., Radnor Township, Pennsylvania, USA). Oxygen, medical air, and NO were blended and introduced through a ventilator (Puritan Bennett 980 Series, Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) (). A target level of 160 ppm inhaled NO and 0.21 FiO2 were delivered via a tight-fitting noninvasive mask using a pressure support mode of 2 cmH2O driving pressure over a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O. Because the NO source of 850 ppm is mixed with nitrogen, the ventilator was set to a range of 0.25-0.26 FiO2, in order to deliver an FiO2 of 0.21 to the patient.
Nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) analyzers were attached to a sampling port proximal to the facemask and provided real-time measurements. Nitrogen dioxide, a potentially harmful gas that develops when oxygen and NO are mixed, was scavenged with calcium hydroxide chambers (Spherasorb™, Intersurgical Ltd, Berkshire, UK), and levels remained less than 1.5 ppm in the circuit. Ambient NO and NO2 levels were intermittently measured in the patient's room and consistently remained below EPA recommendations [] at less than 4 parts-per-billion (ppb) and 12 ppb, respectively.
There were no serious adverse events, and inhalations were well tolerated. Echocardiograms were performed before, during, and after the first inhalation and demonstrated normal estimated pulmonary pressures. Heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure were recorded at 5-minute intervals throughout inhalations and 30 minutes after cessation. The patient did not experience any hemodynamic instability or significant hypoxia with treatments. Nitric oxide oxidizes ferrous (Fe2+) hemoglobin into the ferric state (Fe3+), known as methemoglobin. Methemoglobin levels were continuously monitored during inhalations using a peripheral pulse co-oximeter (Masimo Rainbow SetTM Technology, Irvine, CA) and never surpassed our safety threshold of 5%. Specifically, at the end of the 30-minute and 60-minute inhalations, the highest recorded methemoglobin levels were 3.1% and 4.1%, respectively, and returned to baseline prior to subsequent treatments (). Additionally, the patient received 125 mg of ascorbic acid by mouth daily (on treatment days) to enhance methemoglobin reductase activity [].
Sputum was collected prior to (days 1 and 16), midcycle (days 3 and 23), and on completion (days 12 and 28) of each NO cycle (). Colony forming units (CFU) were calculated using sputum solubilized with Sputolysin® (MilleporeSigma) and plated on Burkholderia cepacia isolation agar. On days 1, 12, 23, and 28, B. multivorans grew from the patient's sputum, but the CFU count was low (). Early in therapy (day 3), the sputum culture yielded highly antibiotic-resistant B. multivorans, consistent with months before; however, by the end of the first week of therapy (day 16), isolated B. multivorans demonstrated susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and levofloxacin and intermediate susceptibility to ceftazidime, a susceptibility pattern not seen for months.
Fever, white blood cell count, and C-reactive protein all decreased with therapy (). The patient never manifested bacteremia or hemodynamic instability suggestive of cepacia syndrome—a dreaded complication of B. cepacia complex infection primarily linked to Burkholderia cenocepacia though also associated with B. multivorans []. The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) remained consistently below 1.2, and she never demonstrated evidence of platelet dysfunction, hemoptysis, or other bleeding. Her lung function improved from her baseline. Specifically, on day 1—before starting high-dose inhaled NO therapy and after recently completing a 16-day course of intravenous meropenem-vaborbactam two days before—the patient's forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were 1.60 L (49% predicted) and 2.05 L (56% predicted), respectively. Both measurements improved at the end of the second admission to FEV1 1.72 L (52% predicted) and FVC 2.36 L (64% predicted). The patient's baseline weight in the prior 6 months remained at the 10th percentile, and her BMI was consistently below 18 kg/m2. Her weight at the start of inhaled NO therapy was 48.4 kg (22nd percentile). It rose to a maximum of 50.3 kg (30th percentile) on day 16 but decreased to 48.9 kg (24th percentile) by day 24.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 50-year-old woman presented to the Breast Unit of Sant’ Anna and San Sebastiano Hospital of Caserta, Italy, after becoming aware of a non-tender lump in the median areolar area of her right breast. She first noticed the mass one month previously. During this period, she did not have any pain or discharge from the nipple. Further, she had no family history of malignancy, including breast cancer. She was in antihypertensive therapy.
She had never undergone any radiation and hormone replacement therapy. On physical examination, the patient had a demarcated, mobile, firm and fast-growing mass in her right breast.
The mass was not tender, approximately 4 cm in diameter, and was detected in the median areolar area of the right breast. There was no clinical evidence of regional lymphadenopathy.
Mammography revealed an opaque and ovoid lesion occupying the median equatorial region of the right breast; this lesion was 35 mm in diameter, with regular margins, moderate intensity and homogeneous density; there was no evidence of defined focus of pathological calcification (Figure ). Ultrasonography revealed a bulky, firm, hypoechoic lesion, with blurred and irregular margins, richly vascularized on color Doppler, with high speed systolic flow. This mass was 45 mm in diameter, and referred to as a heteroplastic lesion. There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy.
Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration on the lesion showed epithelioid and spindle cells, which were positive only to the immunohistochemical staining for vimentin and so we suspected a mesenchymal lesion.
An ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy performed subsequently showed connective tissue, including cells similar to those already present in the needle aspirate and there were many multinuclear osteoclast-like giant cells. The immunohistochemical staining confirmed the mesenchymal nature of the lesion (positivity for vimentin), but did not indicate clearly a specific histotype for the actin, CD34 and S100 protein negativity.
Preoperative examination consisted of a complete blood count, serum kidney and liver function, thyroid function test, and tests for the levels of several hormones related to the development of gynecomastia, including estrogen, testosterone, prolactin and gonadotrophic hormones as well as cancer markers (CEA, CA 15–3, CA 125). Ultrasound (US) of the abdomen failed to document any abnormalities. An isotope bone scan did not reveal any abnormal uptake. All results were within the normal limits.
The patient underwent total mastectomy without axillary lymph node dissection, awaiting histology.
Macroscopic examination of the specimen, measuring 19 × 15 × 8 cm and including the normal nipple, revealed a grayish, apparently delimited nodular lesion, measuring 10 cm in diameter, with cystic-necrotic and few hemorrhagic areas. The lesion was 0.5 cm away from the fascia and 1 cm away from the skin; furthermore, another grayish nodular lesion measuring 1.5 cm was in the subcutaneous tissue.
Microscopic examination of the sections from the specimen showed nodular proliferation of pleomorphic-spindle-shaped and ovoid cells, with connective tissue septa, mixed with many multinuclear osteoclast-like giant cells that did not show, mainly, malignant features (Figures a-b; Figure a, b).
Necrotic areas and abnormal mitosis were identified. Immunohistochemical stainings for Cytokeratin Pan (Figure a), Cytokeratin 7-8-18-19, EMA (epithelial membrane antigen), S100 protein, SMA (smooth muscle actin) and CD34 were negative; immunohistochemical staining for vimentin was positive (Figure b). Mitotic activity was observed with a high proliferation index, assessed with Ki67. Moreover, in the surrounding parenchymal component, there were multiple foci of intraductal carcinoma, evaluated with immunohistochemical staining for muscle actin and collagen IV. The lesion was contained within the margins of excision.
The histological and immunohistochemical findings established the diagnosis of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with osteoclast-like giant cells of the breast.
The patient was monitored after the operation and we did not consider that adjuvant treatment was necessary in the presence of adequate local control and in the absence of metastatic spread of the disease. Follow-up mammography has been satisfactory to date, and she remained well without tumor recurrence at 15 months.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A previously healthy 8-month-old boy presented with a 3×3 cm mass in the right lower leg, which was surgically excised. Pathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of infantile fibrosarcoma and the surgical margin was not clear. His parents refused reexcision but accepted monitoring by regular imaging. However, a mass was detected again in the same area two years after surgery. Therefore, the patient then underwent complete excision, and recurrent sarcoma was confirmed histologically. After the second resection, the patient had monthly follow-up and no evidence of disease was observed on an ongoing one year.
A surveillance whole-body fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan conducted 3 years after the initial presentation demonstrated a recurrent mass in the right lower leg, one micrometastatic lesions at the left proximal fibula and another macrometastasis in the 4th lumbar vertebral column, respectively. Lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a contrast-enhancing lesion of 1.6 cm in the posterior aspect of the 4th lumbar vertebral column without spinal canal compression (). To preserve right lower leg, debulking surgery of the recurrent lesion was performed, and the histological features were found to be consistent with recurrent sarcoma with rhabomyosarcomatous differentiation. Two weeks after the surgery, the patient started to receive chemotherapy with a VAC regimen composed of vincristine (1.5 mg/m2), dactinomycin (0.045 mg/kg), and cyclophosphamide (2.2 g/m2) for a total of 44 weeks treatment course.
Given the potential risk of spinal pathologic fracture and myelopathy, radiotherapy was chosen to treat the 4th lumbar vertebral metastatic lesion. Cyberknife® hypofractionated radiotherapy was decided due to the solitary nature of the metastasis and fewer sessions are needed, which would decrease the frequency of general anesthesia for radiotherapy. The patient was immobilized in a vacuum mattress. Fused enhanced computed tomography (CT) (Accuray) and MRI scans were used in the treatment planning. The delineation of the gross tumor volume (GTV) and the organs at risk was carried out on the planning CT. Given the potential risk of kyphosis and scoliosis by asymmetric irradiation of the spine, the whole involved vertebra was contoured as the GTV. Clinical target volume was equal to the GTV and no margin was added to obtain the planning target volume (PTV), which was 8.84 mL. No fiducial or other markers were implanted to localize the irradiated area. A total of 26 Gy was prescribed to the 75% isodose line, covering 92.64% of the PTV with a maximal spinal cord dose of 744.26 cGy (). Cyberknife® stereotactic body radiotherapy was performed on the 15th, 16th, 19th, and 20th of October 2009 with a mean procedure time of 83 min (range 56 min to 128 min). The radiotherapy course was conducted in a manner concomitant with the first cycle of chemotherapy. During the radiotherapy, immobilization was aided by general anesthesia, and X-sight spine tracking (Accuray Inc.) was used to minimize setup error.
The patient tolerated the anesthesia and immobilization well and remained still during the radiotherapy. Up to the date of this report, i.e., 33 months after radiotherapy, the patient remains neurologically stable and 23% reduction in tumor volume was achieved on the surveillance MRI scans (). No acute radiation toxicity was found.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 69-year-old male with past medical history of hypertension, asthma, coronary artery
disease, end-stage renal disease secondary to hypertensive glomerulosclerosis s/p
deceased donor kidney transplant 4 months back presented to the hospital with
productive cough, fever, and anorexia of 2 weeks duration. Vitals on presentation
were temperature of 38.5°C, heart rate of 72/min, blood pressure of 167/62 mm Hg,
and respiratory rate of 22/min with oxygen saturation between 90% and 92% on room
air. On physical examination, he had bibasilar crackles, more prominent on the left.
Laboratory findings revealed an elevated white blood cell count of 15 100/µL, blood
urea nitrogen of 21, and creatinine of 1.9 (baseline creatinine of 1.9-2.0).
Urinalysis was unremarkable. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed a left lower lobe
consolidation. Pan cultures were obtained, and treatment was started with
intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for empiric coverage. His
posttransplant immunosuppressive regimen of mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and
prednisone was continued along with other supportive measures. His prophylactic
medications of nystatin, valganciclovir, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)
were discontinued 4 weeks prior to admission after completion of 3-month
posttransplant prophylaxis course. On day 3, 1 out of the 4 blood cultures grew
gram-positive bacilli for which ampicillin was added for better central nervous
system (CNS) penetration to cover Listeria infection as well. The
computed tomography (CT) scan of head and lumbar puncture ruled out any CNS
involvement. On day 7, final report of the blood culture revealed weakly acid-fast
filamentous gram-positive bacteria. On further review of the gram stain and colony
morphology of the organisms, it was identified as Nocardia. The
diagnosis of disseminated nocardiosis secondary to pulmonary source (left lower lobe
pneumonia) was made. Treatment for Nocardia was initiated with
imipenem/cilastatin, and initial antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam,
and ampicillin) were discontinued. Despite changing the antibiotics, there was no
significant improvement in his overall clinical condition, and the patient remained
with supplemental oxygen–dependent, persistent cough and with productive phlegm.
Speciation of the organism was consistent with Nocardia
transvalensis, which was resistant to imipenem, bactrim, ceftriaxone,
augmentin, and minocycline. It was reported to be sensitive to linezolid, amikacin,
moxifloxacin, clarithromycin, and tobramycin. Imipenem/cilastatin was discontinued,
and linezolid along with moxifloxacin was initiated on day 14. Within the next 3
days, the patient started showing signs of improvement and was discharged home in a
stable condition. He took linezolid 300 mg daily and moxifloxacin 400 mg daily for
12 months and remained asymptomatic. His follow-up visits were uneventful, and the
patient was asymptomatic. Repeat CXR at the follow-up visit showed resolution of the
pneumonia.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 73-year-old female patient came to the outpatient department with complaints of lower abdominal pain, blood in stools, and whitish discharge through vagina for 10 days. On examination patient's vitals were stable. The patient underwent a CECT scan abdomen which revealed irregular wall thickening involving the rectosigmoid region for a length of ~ 7 cm, with wall thickness of ~ 18 mm. There was loss of fat plane between the uterus and the thickened rectosigmoid colon with air pockets within the endometrial cavity []. Mesocolic fat and perirectal fat stranding was also seen with multiple adjacent subcentimetric lymph nodes. Based on CT findings, possibility of rectosigmoid malignancy and colouterine fistula was considered.

"This patient is a 29-year-old white woman from the USA with a medical history significant for severe IBS-D (diagnosed at age 12) and anxiety disorder. In July 2015, she presented with severe bleeding hemorrhoids secondary to IBS, which required hemorrhoidectomy and anal sphincterotomy in August 2015. The week before the surgery she developed pharyngitis and was treated with azithromycin, which resulted in mucousy diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. She tested negative for C. difficile antigen and toxins at that time.
A week after surgery, she developed a perirectal abscess that had formed at the site of the sphincterotomy and was prescribed orally administered ciprofloxacin. Despite moderate symptom improvement, in September 2015 she required an abscess incision and drainage procedure and Penrose drain insertion. Prior to the surgery she was given a single dose of clindamycin. An additional 2-week course of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole was then prescribed. In late September 2015 she was admitted to the hospital for two nights due to further complications related to the abscess and was then diagnosed as having a perianal fistula.
In November 2015, she was prescribed clindamycin for an episode of group C streptococcal-positive pharyngitis. In late November 2015, she was also diagnosed as having Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, which according to her medical record may partially explain the poor wound healing from the perirectal abscess. In December 2015, her fistula required an anus seton placement. She was treated with multiple courses of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole off and on from December 2015 to January 2016.
In January 2016, following up on her recurrent pharyngitis, she was diagnosed as having chronic tonsillitis which led to tonsillectomy. In February 2016, 2 weeks after the surgery she was prescribed clindamycin. At the beginning of March 2016, she was diagnosed as having bacterial vaginosis and was prescribed orally administered metronidazole. A week later she was diagnosed as having vaginal candidiasis and was prescribed orally administered fluconazole. In April 2016, she complained of dysuria and was prescribed ciprofloxacin. After 2 days, when urine analysis results came back negative, she was asked by her physician to stop the treatment.
In June 2016, she presented for follow-up with ongoing diarrhea and abdominal pain. She was diagnosed as having C. difficile diarrhea, her antigen and toxins laboratory results were indeterminate, and a toxigenic strain was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). She was prescribed a 6-week course of orally administered vancomycin. After a week of treatment her symptoms worsened, and following discussion with her gastroenterologist her treatment was switched to a 2-week course of metronidazole. Hours later, she was admitted to the hospital for a 4-day period for colitis. Her C. difficile antigen and toxin test returned negative during her admission. She received intravenously administered metronidazole treatment during her hospitalization. Her symptoms improved during her hospital stay, with 1–2 soft bowel movements a day. At discharge her metronidazole course was stopped and she was again prescribed vancomycin, which she took for over a month. She continued to experience GI irregularity (3–5 bowel movements a day) beyond what she had experienced secondary to her IBS prior to her surgeries. In March 2017, she was prescribed rifaximin for 2 weeks to treat chronic diarrhea.
In November 2017, she was prescribed a series of clinical intestinal tests (SmartGut™, uBiome Inc., San Francisco, USA) with the instructions to administer the test at home whenever she was experiencing a noticeable change of GI symptoms, then follow-up with her health care provider to discuss the results. This sequencing-based test requires that patients use a sterile swab to transfer a small amount of fecal material from toilet paper into a vial containing a lysis and stabilization buffer that preserves the microbial DNA for transport by mail back to the laboratory for processing, which involves DNA extraction, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplification, and sequencing []. She first used this test in November 2017, about a month after completing a 2-week course of rifaximin. The results revealed a number of microbial organisms that were outside the healthy reference ranges, but she was negative for all pathogenic organisms included in the test, including C. difficile (Fig. ).
Between November and December 2017, her GI symptoms worsened considerably; her daily bowel movements increased from 3–4 to 6–10, stool consistency became more mucous-like and gelatinous, and she was experiencing more pain with defecation. She re-tested with SmartGut™ test again in January 2018. Her results continued to reveal a number of microbial organisms outside the healthy range and, this time, her sample also indicated the presence of C. difficile (Fig. ). She immediately contacted her primary care provider, who re-tested her for C. difficile and confirmed indeterminate CDI by antigen and toxins A and B. Additional PCR testing at a regional laboratory confirmed the sample was positive for a toxigenic C. difficile strain. As a result of testing, her clinician started her on fidaxomicin; her symptoms improved rapidly. By April 2018, she had returned to her baseline in regard to her IBS-related GI symptoms with no blood in her stools.
In addition, the second SmartGut™ sample was tested for toxins A and B by sequencing at uBiome Inc. laboratory in San Francisco, USA, which resulted positive for both and confirmed the toxigenic nature of the C. difficile strain.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 64-year-old woman experienced gradual visual loss for several months prior to her first examination. The woman had a 15-year history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In addition, she suffered from hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sleep apnea, and a sense of unsteadiness, which had worsened during the last months. She was on several medications (aspirin, omeprazole, simvastatin, atenolol, ramipril, amlodipine, albuterol inhalation, budenoside, and formoterol inhalation). She negated eye pain. BCVA was 0.8 in both eyes. Both visual fields exhibited temporal defects (Humphrey field test). A fundus examination showed peripapillary atrophy in both eyes, but no sign of edema. An MRI with and without intravenous contrast performed 1 week later revealed an increased volume of fluid surrounding both optical nerves as well as increased signal intensity in the optical nerve sheaths, as seen in OPN. The MRI also showed increased signaling in the retrobulbar fat of the left eye and possible subcortical vasculitis. At a consultation, 1 week after the first visit, BCVA was unchanged since the last visit. Laboratory testing was done for sarcoidosis (ACE), syphilis (WR, VDRL), and neuromyelitis optica (NMO). In addition, ESR, CRP, HGB, and blood count were determined. Results showed a high or abnormal ESR, serum lysozyme, polyclonal IgG, and creatinine. Results for NMO antibodies, syphilis, and sarcoidosis markers were normal or negative. A chest X-ray did not find any sign of sarcoidosis. However, a slightly enlarged heart was observed, suggesting a developing heart failure. The woman was later administered intravenous corticosteroids (1 g ×2) and cyclophosphamide to treat her SLE. Shortly after, the woman was hospitalized due to cardiac arrhythmia. Warfarin and digoxin were prescribed, and the woman was discharged from the hospital some days later. Because of her arrhythmia, future treatment with corticosteroids was restricted.
At a new examination 3 months after her first visit, BCVA was unchanged. Results from eye field tests were still abnormal, with no certain change since the last examination. An SST color vision test showed more defective color vision in the left eye (80 p), compared to the right (30 p). Fundus examination showed no optic disc edema in either eye.
At a new consultation 2 months later, BCVA was still unchanged at 0.8 in both eyes. She was on prednisone (5mg/day) in addition to methotrexate (5 mg/week) and levetiracetam, which had been prescribed since her last visit. A fundus examination revealed peripapillary atrophy, but no signs of disc edema in either the left or the right eye. Visual field tests were abnormal (Humphrey field test, VFI was 61% in right eye and 71% in left eye). One month later, she was given injections of rituximab.
At the final eye examination 10 months after her first visit, BCVA was 0.8/0.65. A slight improvement of visual test results was observed (Humphrey field test, VFI was 83% in right eye and 74% in left eye). As noted previously, color vision was more defective in the left eye (35 p) compared to the right (20 p), although some improvement was seen since the last examination.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 47-year-old Caucasian man presented with forehead swelling and puffiness around the eyes. The swelling had gradually increased over a period of two months. The patient had purulent nasal discharge and no visual symptoms. Sixteen years ago, he was involved in a road traffic accident in which he sustained a laceration on his forehead as he collided with the windscreen of the car. He attended his local accident and emergency department and the laceration was treated by primary suturing under local anaesthesia (LA). No Plain radiographs were carried out. The wound healed well and the patient had no problems.
On examination, a 5 cm linear scar was noted over the forehead swelling. The swelling measured 6 cm x 3 cm and was mildly tender. The patient underwent a complete ear nose throat examination. The nasal speculum examination showed sinusitis of the left paranasal sinuses which was confirmed by endoscopy. The CT (computed tomography) scan of paranasal sinuses () showed a radio-opaque foreign body (FB) in the left ethmoid sinus with opacification of all sinuses on the left side.
The patient underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery with removal of glass fragment and draining of the sinuses. His symptoms resolved completely following the procedure. At 12 months follow-up, the patient has had no similar problems and remains asymptomatic.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 66-year-old female was admitted to Kagawa University Hospital (Kagawa, Japan) with the complaint of intermittent epigastric pain that was exacerbated by fasting. The patient had a history of hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Physical examination upon admission revealed no anemia (via conjunctival pallor examination), jaundice or pulmonary abnormalities. On palpation, the abdomen of the patient was soft and flat, with no areas of tenderness. Furthermore, pretibial edema was not observed and superficial lymph nodes were not palpable. Serum concentrations of the tumor markers, carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9, were within the normal ranges (<5 ng/ml and 0–37 U/ml, respectively). However, X-ray examination indicated reduced gastric distension, as well as deformation of the stomach, which exhibited a leather bottle-like appearance (). In addition, the lower gastric body demonstrated luminal narrowing and increased rigidity, with a depressed lesion (longest diameter, 20 mm) at the posterior wall of the gastric antrum and abdominal computed tomography revealed thickening of the antrum. No lymphadenopathy was observed. Additionally, endoscopy revealed an ulcerative lesion covered by a white necrotic substance on the posterior wall of the antrum () and severe luminal narrowing, with poor distension of the lower gastric body. The upper gastric body, however, demonstrated good extension when compared with the middle and lower gastric bodies. The folds of the gastric antrum were flexible, stretched smoothly, and crossed one another, resulting in a waffle-like appearance on the greater curvature of the upper gastric body (). Analysis of biopsy specimens from the ulcerative lesion revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma containing signet ring cells, however, adenocarinoma was absent from biopsy specimens obtained from the abnormally crossed folds. Due to the morphological changes that occured in the gastric folds, creating the waffle-like appearance, it was determined that cancer cell invasion of the upper gastric body was likely, and a total gastrectomy was performed. The resected specimen revealed the wall thickening and crossing folds of the gastric body () that were previously observed by endoscopy. Microscopic examination revealed that cancer cells had spread throughout the upper gastric body and had infiltrated the vessels in the submucosa, predominately into the muscularis propria, and marginally into the serosa (). Immunohistochemical examination revealed positive staining for MUC5AC and MUC6 (gastric marker mucins) and negative staining for MUC2 and CD10 (intestinal marker mucins), indicating gastric-type mucin expression. The final diagnosis, according to the Japanese Classification of Gastric Carcinoma (), was T4aN3aM0, clinical stage IIIC advanced gastric cancer. The patient was discharged 17 days after surgery without complications and commenced three cycles of S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy (80 mg/day, days 1–28) for 16 weeks. Following three courses of chemotherapy for 16 weeks, treatment was terminated due to patient fatigue. The patient has survived and is without disease recurrance 14 months after surgery.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"In 2008, a 69-year-old man was diagnosed with a nonmetastatic Fuhrman grade 3 left RCC. A radical left nephrectomy was performed, and the patient was monitored for 2 years without any other medical complications. No renal failure or electrolyte disorders were reported. In 2010, a metastatic progression was suspected on a systematic computed tomography scan, with lateral aortic nodes involvement and a left renal fossa tumor extended to the left colon and diaphragm. Sunitinib was initiated at 37.5 mg/day after biopsies confirmed a histology-proven metastatic RCC recurrence. The patient was treated with a 28-day on and 14-day off schedule. Plasma uric acid was normal at baseline. During the first cycle of this treatment, the patient presented his very first episode of gout attack located on a big toe. As it was reported to be normal in 30% of acute gout attacks if assessed immediately, the plasma uric acid concentration was assessed 15 days later, which was 81 mg/L (normal plasma uric acid concentration <70 mg/L). No concomitant renal failure, hemoglobin and/or hematocrit disorder, or concurrent medication intake other than sunitinib (acetylsalicylic acid, diuretics, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, etc.) were reported. Purine-rich food and alcohol were cutoff, but the patient did not consume much of them. Allopurinol (100 mg/day) was initiated before the second cycle of sunitinib without colchicine because interactions with sunitinib were feared. Two months later, during the fourth sunitinib cycle, the patient developed a similar acute gout attack without any identified triggering factor. Allopurinol dose was increased to maximum (300 mg/day), while sunitinib was maintained at 37.5 mg/day until progression. The patient kept sticking to his purine-depleted diet. Iterative gout attacks of lower intensity were still periodically reported during the following months under sunitinib therapy. After progression, a new line of treatment was initiated. Sunitinib discontinuation was followed by a total regression of gout attacks.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"Patient four was a 58-month old female when her right eye experienced a choroidal infarction following OAC for her bilateral RB. Her genetic testing showed heterozygosity for the C677T polymorphisim. The infarct occurred after her eighth dose of OAC with carboplatin, topotecan, and melphalan to the right eye (tenth treatment of OAC for this patient, two treatments only to left eye). This was her first time receiving nitrous oxide (duration 21 min, max ET N2O 60.5%) during OAC for the right eye.

"A 62-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of mental abnormality and hypomnesia for 3 months. The main mental symptoms were gibberish, irrational talk, impaired mental attention, without apparent hallucinations and delusions. The patient did not present with fluctuating consciousness, lack of consciousness, or loss of consciousness. The family of the patient reported that she had a history of fever before she experienced the mental symptoms. Her highest body temperature was 38.6 °C. Her axillary temperature became normal after she received antibiotic therapy for 4 days. However, she gradually developed symptoms of mental abnormality. She also intermittently complained of abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, and urinary incontinence for 1 month. She did not experience other discomforts, such as headaches, dizziness, and convulsion. She visited a local hospital in October 2018, and the routine blood test showed that the white blood cell counts were normal, and the percentage of lymphocytes was high. The blood potassium was 1.91 mmol/l (normal 3.5-5.3 mmol/l), and the prolactin level was 90.55 μg/l (normal 2.74–26.72 μg/l). The free thyroxine was slightly high, the thyroglobulin antibody was 12.32 IU/ml (normal 0–115 IU/ml), and the thyroid peroxidase antibody was 10.42 IU/ml (normal 0–34 IU/ml). The testing results of antinuclear antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anti-Jo-1 antibody, anti-dsDNA antibody, anti-Scl-70 antibody, anti-SSA antibody, and anti-SSB antibody were yielded negative, and the tests for hepatitis, HIV, and syphilis virus were also negative. The local hospital suspected intracranial infection, endocrine disease, and electrolyte disorders and gave her symptomatic treatment. Nevertheless, her symptoms showed no noticeable improvement. It was difficult to diagnose the disease, so the patient was admitted to our hospital. The patient had a history of diabetes, hypertension, erosive gastritis, and cataract surgery, but she had no family history of neurological diseases.
The physical examination revealed that her body temperature was 36.8 °C, and there was tenderness below the xiphoid. The neurological examination showed impaired mental attention and reaction capacity, slow speech, normal manifestations of the brain nerve, normal muscle strength, and muscle tone, negative meningeal irritation sign and pathological reflex, normal tendon reflex. The patient could not cooperate with the sensory system examination. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score was only 6/30.
Encephalitis was initially suspected, and lumbar puncture was performed. The CSF examination showed that the CSF pressure was 110 mmH2O, and the white blood cell count was normal, but she had an increased total protein level of 0.57 g/l (normal 0.15–0.45 g/l) and a glucose level of 5.10 mmol/l (normal 2.2–3.9 mmol/l). The coxsackie B virus, enterovirus, and cytomegalovirus test levels were normal. Bacterial culture and Cryptococcus neoformans tests were negative. A contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain was normal. The diagnosis of encephalitis was excluded in general. However, leukoencephalopathy was evident on the T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. A high-signal intensity in the white matter of the cerebral hemisphere, especially at the subcortex of the frontotemporal and corona radiata, was found on the T2 FLAIR images (Fig. a-c). The MRI imaging of the left basal ganglia and bilateral corona radiata showed lacunar infarction. Magnetic resonance angiography indicated that the blood vessels were normal. The DWI results revealed a symmetrically distributed strip-shaped high-intensity signal of the corticomedullary junction in the bilateral frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes (Fig. d-f).
Skin biopsy samples were obtained at 10 cm above the patient’s ankle. A light microscope was used to examine the samples, which showed hyperkeratosis of the epidermis. A few lymphocytes and tissue cells infiltrated through the superficial vessels of the dermis (Fig. a). Electron microscopy showed round-shaped intranuclear inclusions in the nucleus of the fibrocytes. The intranuclear inclusions had clear borders and were composed of fibrous substances without a membrane structure (Fig. b and c).
The fasting blood glucose was 9.48 mmol/l, and glycosylated hemoglobin was 6.6%. The routine urine test showed normal results. The patient presented with mental abnormality for 3 months. We did not consider the diagnoses of hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome. Furthermore, the patient did not present with depression, anxiety, consciousness disorders, hallucinations, and neurasthenia, which were common mental symptoms in patients with diabetes. The results of the electrolyte showed hypokalemia (2.6 mmol/L), hyponatremia (127.3 mmol/L), and hypochloremia (86.5 mmol/L). The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and cortisol hormone tests showed normal results. The MRI of the hypophysis showed no abnormal areas. The electroencephalography showed low-and moderate-amplitude desynchronized-mixed waves when she fell asleep.
Brain protection and symptomatic therapy were given when the patient was hospitalized, and the symptoms were relieved. However, she still complained of recurrent vomiting and urinary incontinence. The patient was alive, and the condition of the patient did not worsen or improve for 6 months after she was discharged.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 72 year-old man developed right side weakness after a left ACA infarction and was transferred to the department of rehabilitation medicine 7 weeks after the attack. He had no remarkable medical history but was diagnosed with diabetes at our hospital. He had a family history of ischemic stroke (affecting his younger brother). On transfer to our department, he was alert but had cognitive impairment with a K-MMSE (Korean version of the Mini-Mental Status Examination) score of 13. Manual muscle test (MMT) grades of his right upper extremity-were all 3/5, lower extremity test grades were 2/5 except for ankle plantar flexor grades of 1/5, and dorsiflexor grades were 0/5. He had no spasticity in his elbow and knee joints, and had a modified Ashworth scale (MAS) score of zero. His sensory function was intact and deep tendon reflex was normoactive. He complained that his hand moved abnormally against his will. He could grasp and release with his bare hands on the doctor's order, but when grasping some objects with his palm, he was unable to release them. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed acute cerebral infarction at the left ACA region (). For TMS, we used a Magstim 200 monopulse® (Magstim co., Whiteland, UK) connected to a figure-eight coil (7 cm outer diameter for each loop) with a maximum magnetic strength of 2.0 tesla. The coil was initially centered on the vertex, perpendicular to the scalp, with the handle pointing posteriorly at a 45 degree angle from the median sagittal line and then moved in 1 cm steps in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle with a surface gel electrode. The active electrode was placed over the muscle belly and the reference electrode over the distal interphalangeal joint of the index finger. The signals were displayed by Keypoint® EMG (Dantec, Skovlunde, Denmark) and stored in a laboratory computer. Using a paired pulse magnetic stimulation technique, we studied intracortical inhibition (ICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF). In this case, when we stimulated the left motor cortex area, the resting motor threshold (rMT) was 54% of the maximum magnetic strength and the MEP amplitude was 287 µV. At the right motor cortex area, the rMT was 57% and the MEP amplitude was 579 µV. In the ICF study, when we stimulated the left motor cortex area, the MEP amplitude was increased to 1,697 µV. In the ICI study, the amplitude was not suppressed, but rather increased to 1,170 µV (). The SEP studiesusing median nerve stimulation showed normal values with no statistically significant difference between sides ().","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 13-year-old boy presented with sudden onset of painless blurring of vision in his both eyes. He had a history of exanthematous fever 20 days back and was treated symptomatically. There were healing skin lesions on face, abdomen and upper and lower limbs []. On examination, the un-corrected visual acuity in oculi uterque (OU) was 3/60, and best corrected visual acuity was 6/6; N-8 with − 3.00 Diopter spherical (DS) correction. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 14 and 15 mm Hg, respectively in the right and left eye. Anterior chambers (AC) were quiet and shallow, and on gonioscopy angles were open to anterior trabecular meshwork. By immersion A-scan ultrasonography AC depth (ACD) were 3.47 and 3.41 mm, and lens thickness were 3.64 mm and 3.61 mm, respectively in the right and left eye. Pupils were symmetrical, round, regular and reactive to light. Fundus examination was significant for the presence of bilateral retinal folds in the macular region bilaterally []. B scan ultrasonography showed features of annular cilliochoroidal effusion []. A dermatology opinion was taken, which pointed toward varicella, and serum was positive for the specific immunoglobulin M (1.14) antibodies. Patient was started on oral prednisone (50 mg/day) and topical homatropine 2% thrice daily.

"A 62-year-old male with past medical history of type 2 DM (DM-2) and hypertension of 20 years presented to our emergency room with progressive dyspnea that had worsened gradually over the last three months. He was being treated in another facility with questionable diagnosis of congestive heart failure with incomplete response to diuretic therapy. There was no history of chest pain, cough, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He was a nonsmoker and had used alcohol occasionally. There was no recent viral or flu-like illness. On careful questioning, he complained of difficulty in walking and weakness in his legs. The patient denied any back pain, fever, weight loss, bladder involvement, or pain and paresthesias in his extremities. Neurological examination revealed bilateral symmetric muscle weakness with power of 4/5 in upper proximal and distal extremities and 3/5 in lower proximal and distal extremities. There was no ptosis or gaze paresis. Cranial nerves I–XII were grossly intact. There was no evidence of atrophy of the hand muscles and fasciculations. Sensory exam revealed decreased pinprick sensation distal part of extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were graded one in both upper and lower extremities. His blood pressure on admission was 161/106 mm Hg. A fasting blood glucose done at emergency room triage was 229 mg/dL. The clinical and functional examinations did not correlate with the severity of dyspnea. Arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed respiratory insufficiency (pO2 of 60 mm Hg, pCO2 of 58 mm Hg, and SaO2 of 89%).
Initially, chest radiograph was obtained which revealed normal lung fields with no evidence of fluid overload. Serum electrolytes and thyroid panel were found to be normal. β-natriuretic peptide level and 2-D echocardiogram results were inconsistent with heart failure. Adequate glycemic control was achieved with insulin, and serial ABGs remained unchanged on day 1. As the diagnosis leaned towards neuromuscular involvement, bilevel positive alveolar pressure (BiPAP) was started which was followed by serial vital capacities and negative inspiratory pressure (NIP). CSF analysis narrowed the differential to demyelinating neuropathy, which proved to be inconsistent with Gullian-Barré syndrome. EMG analysis revealed sensorimotor polyneuropathy that was predominantly axonal and demyelinating in nature (). In the meantime, the patient's vital capacity dropped to 0.7 liters with NIP of −26 cm H2O. Anti-paraneoplastic antibody screening with ANA and anti-MAG levels were noncontributory. On day 4, the CSF culture was negative. As diabetic polyradiculopathy was considered the most likely diagnosis, intravenous immunoglobulin IVIg 0.4 g/kg/day was started for five days. The patient tolerated the treatment well and showed both subjective and objective improvement as assessed by serial ABGs, vital capacity, and NIP assessment (). The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center in stable respiratory condition with intermittent nasal oxygen insufflation and overnight BiPAP ventilation.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 31-year-old white male presented with a progressive spastic quadriparesis over 1-year duration. Four years previously, he had fallen from a horse into a tree called Mandacaru (Cereus jamaracu) in northeast Brazil. At the time of the injury, the patient had several skin wounds but no neurological symptoms or signs. Four years later, he presented with new onset of spastic tetraparesis characterized by motor 4/5 strength in the upper and lower limbs; he could only ambulate with assistance.
While plain radiographs of cervical spine revealed upper cervical kyphosis, computed tomography (CT) scan [] demonstrated a foreign body resembling a needle that entered the spinal canal through the left C3-C4 foramen. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [] demonstrated extensive edema in the cervical spinal cord and enhancement with gadolinium of tissue surrounding the foreign body.
The needle was removed utilizing a left side approach to the left C3-C4 foramen. (Hodgson-like approach[] posterior-lateral view).
A 5-cm thorn was removed []; of interest, there was no cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. The postoperative course was uneventful and he continued to improve over the next 6 months.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 44-year-old female patient living in Purano-baneshwor, Kathmandu, Nepal was referred from the National Center for Rheumatic disease (NCRD) for laboratory investigation in the Modern Diagnostic Laboratory and Research Center on 24 July 2019, presenting with hyperpigmented erythematous rash all over her body along with V-shaped rashes on the neckline since 2 months. Initial symptoms as mentioned by the patient included itchy rashes and photosensitivity. She had no history of headache, fever, and weight loss with a normal vital test. In addition, she had no surgical as well as medical history of chronic disease. She had progressed symptoms like muscle pain (especially in the left arm and thigh), unable to walk upstairs, inability to stretch hands, unable to turn neck, and difficulty in swallowing food.
Physical examination showed signs of inflammation supported by laboratory findings, i.e. erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) done by Wintrobe’s method found to be 30 mm/1st hour (normal 0–20 mm/1st hour), leukocytosis (14,920 cells/µL) with neutrophilia 13,080 cells/µL (normal range 2500–8000 cells/µL), and carbohydrate reactive protein (CRP) done by nephelometry found to be 25.3 mg/L (normal <3 mg/L). Hematological parameters were measured using Sysmex XN-350 and are presented in . Biochemical parameters () were measured by a fully automated Dimension RxL Max integrated chemistry analyzer that revealed an elevated level of serum creatinine kinase 17,160 IU/L (normal 26–192 IU/L), and normal plasma glucose level and renal function test. Her liver enzymes revealed an elevated level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), i.e. 370 IU/L (normal 5–45 IU/L), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 616 IU/L (normal 5–45 IU/L). Nailfold capillaroscopy of 8 fingers findings showed variant and simple Raynaud's. Urine analysis, chest X-ray, and thyroid function test were normal. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 1657 IU/L (reference 25–250 IU/L), Jo-1 antibodies, and dsDNA antibodies were negative while anti-Mi-2 antibody was positive. Raynaud’s phenomenon and anti-Mi-2 antibody are highly specific to dermatomyositis. Based on the above findings, a diagnosis of dermatomyositis was made.
She was administered with 50 mg prednisolone with a significant improvement of muscular activities within a month; with a modest fall in serum creatinine kinase level as shown in and 25 mg azathioprine once a day as immunosuppressive drugs. At present, she is orally administered 50 mg prednisolone therapy for maintenance therapy and still being followed up.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 50-year-old-male, presented with the complaints of left flank pain of 1 month duration. He denied having any constitutional symptoms, voiding difficulty, ejaculatory disturbances, hematuria or constipation.
Digital rectal examination revealed a mass in the region of left seminal vesicle separate from the prostate. The total leukocyte counts were within the normal limits, serum prostate specific antigen was 0.759 ng/ml and urine culture was sterile. Serum urea and creatinine values were 20 mg/dl (8-23 mg/dL) was 1 mg/dl (0.6-1.2 mg/dL), respectively. Repeat transabdominal and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) [] revealed a well-defined mass lesion, measuring 13.5 cm × 9.9 cm × 5.4 cm in size, posterior to the urinary bladder with homogeneous, hypoechoic echotexture in the region of left seminal vesicle. Prostate was normal in size and echotexture. There was moderate left hydroureteronephrosis with near normal renal parenchymal thickness and echotexture. The distal ureter was disappearing into the mass lesion. Computed tomography (CT) with contrast [Figure and ] revealed a mass with mixed cystic and solid densities in the location of left seminal vesicle. The lesion showed good post-contrast enhancement and no evidence of calcification. The terminal part of the left ureter appeared embedded within the mass lesion. The lesion was seen separate from the prostate and the left seminal vesicle wasn’t distinctly visible on the TRUS and the CT scans. Radiological opinion in view of the well-defined nature, solid-cystic, homogeneous and hypoechoic texture was that of a benign mass lesion. Since TRUS and CT gave adequate anatomical information of the lesion, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was not requested for, though that would have been the next logical step. Cystoscopy showed a trigonal bulge in the left side. Retrograde catheterization was not possible implying obstruction and or distortion of the juxtavesical ureter. Per-rectal fine needle aspiration of the mass yielded only blood and cytology of the same was inconclusive.
The lesion was explored through a lower midline incision on the abdomen. A huge mass lesion was encountered in the retrovesical location, obscuring the left seminal vesicle and involving the left ureter causing proximal dilatation. In the beginning ureter was liberated by meticulous dissection. This was followed by decompression of the tumor by scooping out of myxoid, jelly-like material after a capsulotomy. The capsule was carefully excised throughout taking care to preserve the neurovascular structure at the bladder neck. No separate seminal vesicle was made out at the culmination of tumor excision, suggesting that the former structure is the organ of origin. The right seminal vesicle was normal in appearance.
There were no post-operative complications and patient was discharged on 10th post-operative day. Histopathological examination revealed a benign schwannoma [] with degenerative changes such as foamy macrophages [] and cholesterol clefts [] and characteristic Verocay bodies []. Multiple sections did not reveal any seminal vesicle tissue within the tumor, suggesting that the tumor had completely effaced the organ. Patient was voiding well without incontinence and his erectile and ejaculatory functions are preserved. There has been no recurrence of tumor until date, that is, 2 years and 10 months after surgery.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 55-year-old man presented with fever and abdominal pain. Abdominal CT showed swelling of the right kidney and low attenuation areas (Figure ). Laboratory tests and renal CT imaging were suggestive of pyelonephritis. However, multiple cavitary lesions were also found on the routine chest radiography performed on admission. VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery) lung biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma presumably from the kidney. Therefore, a renal tumor with multiple pulmonary metastases, was considered. At the time, transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) was suspected, which later proved to be a misdiagnosis, and chemotherapy with MVAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin, and cisplatin) was given. However, the chemotherapy was not effective, and the patient died of respiratory failure 2 months later. On autopsy, the primary tumor was found to be a collecting duct carcinoma, and there were lung, liver, spleen, bone marrow, right adrenal gland, and para-aortic lymph node metastases. CT done while the patient was alive detected lung (Figure ), liver (Figure ), and para-aortic lymph node (Figure ) metastases.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 60-year-old woman presented with one year of worsening throat discomfort, intermittent cough, and dyspnea with exertion. She denied any hemoptysis, otalgia, or odynophagia. She had no other significant past medical or social history including no history of tobacco use.
A CT neck with contrast demonstrated a mass involving the anterolateral right subglottic larynx with extension along the upper cervical trachea ().
In-office flexible nasolaryngoscopy identified a fleshy pink-colored mass in the immediate right subglottis obstructing approximately 50% of the airway. She then underwent microdirect laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy for debulking and biopsy ().
Operative findings were notable for extension of the mass approximately 1 cm below the true vocal fold.
Pathologic analysis noted small B-cells positive for CD19, CD20, and PAX5 and negative for CD5, CD10, and cyclin D21. FISH was negative for the 18q21 MALT1 gene. The combination of these findings confirmed the diagnosis of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type was made.
A staging CT neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis scan was negative for metastatic disease. Following multidisciplinary tumor board review, she was recommended low-dose radiation at 24–30 Gy in 2 Gy daily fractions for approximately 3 weeks contingent upon review of a bone marrow biopsy. Bone marrow biopsy was negative, and radiation treatment was finalized as 30 Gy in 15 fractions over the course of 1 month. Treatment was completed by May 2018. Following radiation treatment, she reported mild dysphagia and dysgeusia which has improved. Her breathing has improved, and she has returned to her normal exercise tolerance. At 21-month follow-up, there was no evidence of disease on exam or imaging; however, she continues to report a mild cough intermittently with no issues with eating, drinking, or breathing.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 73-year-old man had a past operative history of ruptured colonic diverticulitis treated by Hartmann’s procedure in 2007, and perforated peptic ulcer treated by pyloroplasty in 2009. He suffered from abdominal and tarry stool for 5 days in March 2011, so he was admitted to a rural hospital for further survey and medication. An initial upper GI endoscopy showed gastric ulcer only, but hypotension with tachycardia and a drop in hemoglobin of 9 g/dl from 12 g/dl occurred the next day. Intravenous fluid and blood transfusion with packed red blood cell were prescribed. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with rupture was highly suspected, so CTA of aorta (Fig. ) was carried out which disclosed an AAA with swollen bowel loop. He was transferred to our emergency department (ED) for consideration of vascular surgical intervention.
On arrival in our ED, vital signs were a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per min, a heart rate of 130 beats per min, a blood pressure of 98/73 mmHg, and a body temperature of 35.6 °C. Physical examination revealed a pale conjunctiva, no heart murmur, clear breathing sound, old operative scar over middle abdomen, and hypoactive bowel sound with tenderness over the periumbilical region. Leukocytosis, anemia, abnormal liver profiles, and metabolic acidosis were found. Laboratory investigations were summarized in Table .
A cardiovascular surgeon carried out emergent angiography of aorta, which depicted bleeding from the wall of the AAA and chronic total occlusion of the left external iliac artery, so a modified aorto-uni-iliac stent graft (Fig. ) was implanted with femoral-to-femoral bypass, which underwent smoothly. A general surgeon performed exploratory laparotomy and found a massive blood clot with a volume of about 1310 ml filling the entire lumen of the small intestine, a dilated and swollen duodenum about 6 cm in diameter with ecchymosis, and a fistula about 2x2cm over the third portion of the duodenum (Fig. ). Duodenostomy with primary closure for repair of fistula defect, partition of the duodenum between the 2nd and 3rd portions, and side-to-side gastrojejunostomy were completed smoothly. He was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit for postoperative care. CTA of aorta showed neither endoleakage nor intraabdominal abscess on postoperative day 17. He was discharged without complications and returned for follow up at the out-of-patient department on postoperative day 25.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"An 18-year-old young woman presented with 6 months amenorrhea. Menarche had occurred at age 11 years. She suffered from mild cerebral palsy (possibly due to low birth weight of 1.88 kg at 38 weeks’ gestation), mild asthma, Asperger’s syndrome, anxiety, and epileptic events from age 14 to 15 years, considered secondary to cerebral palsy. She had a ruptured appendix at age 12 years. There was no other significant past history; no drug usage; she did not smoke or drink alcohol, and had not become sexually active. Sertraline was used for treatment of anxiety from 2009 to 2010 followed by fluoxetine. There was a family history of osteoarthritis and osteopenia and of pancreatic cancer; no family history of premature menopause. The OCP was commenced at age 12 years. The attending gynecologist recorded “although her periods were reasonably normal, she was put on the pill (20 µg ethinyloestradiol and 100 µg levonorgestrol) the next year because coping with her periods made her anxiety and depression symptoms worse.” Her first HPV4 vaccination was administered at age 12 years and 9 months; the second vaccination near her 13th birthday, and the third vaccination at age 13 years and 5 months. The first HPV4 vaccination was given concomitantly with hepatitis B vaccination in the other arm. OCP usage continued for 2 years to age 14 years. It was briefly ceased at age 14 and this was followed by 3 months amenorrhea. OCP was then resumed without further investigation. At age 18 years, the OCP was again ceased and amenorrhea again ensued.
Follicle-stimulating hormone 1 month later was elevated at 44.5 IU/L (menopausal range is 25-130 IU/L). Luteinizing hormone was 29.2 IU/L (basal range 2.0-12, midcycle peak range 8.0-90, postmenopausal range 5.0-62 IU/L). Estradiol was 157 pmol/L. She continued amenorrheic and presented again for investigation 6 months later. At this time, follicle-stimulating hormone remained elevated at 34 IU/L. Luteinizing hormone was elevated at 46 IU/L. Estrodiol (Oest2) was 413 pmol/L and progesterone 2 nmol/L. Anti-Müllerian hormone was 1.5 pmol/L (14.0-30.0 pmol/L normal; levels <14 pmol/L suggest diminished ovulatory reserve) tested by Beckman Coulter Gen II ELISA assay. Anti-Müllerian hormone repeated 6 months later was <1 pmol/L and estradiol was <37 pmol/L. At this time and at age 18 years POI was diagnosed.
Full blood count, iron levels, liver function, blood glucose, and renal function were normal. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was normal 0.4 mIU/L (normal 0.3-3.5 mIU/L) and thyroid antibodies were normal. Prolactin was normal 294 mIU/L. Testosterone 0.9 nmol/L (normal 0.2-1.8 nmol/L); free androgen index 2.6 (normal 0.3-4.0); iron studies were normal. There were no antiadrenal or antiovarian antibodies detected. Morning cortisol was 218 nmol/L (normal range 160-650) nmol/L, ACTH 14 ng/L (normal range 9-51 ng/L), growth factor-1 27 nmol/L (normal range 21-76 nmol/L). Pelvic ultrasound performed at the time when the anti-Müllerian hormone level was 1.5 showed a normal uterus with an endometrial echo of 8.2 mm. Transvaginal ultrasound was declined and the left ovary was not visualized. The right ovary was 3.1 cm3 in size and there was a 9-mm follicle within it. Brief menstrual bleeds then occurred for 4 months before amenorrhea resumed.
Testing for Fragile X revealed 2 normal-sized triplet alleles 23 and 37 cytosine–guanine–guanine n repeats (the normal zone is <44). Testing for galactosemia showed a normal Gal-1-P uridyl transferase-RC at 0.31 U/g hemoglobin (normal range 0.26-0.52 U/g). Records reported a vitamin B12 deficiency at age 16 years, but levels of vitamin B12 were within normal limits at 275 pmol/L (normal range 135-650 pmol/L). Karyotype was established as 46XX.
This young woman elected to undergo right ovary cryopreservation through Monash IVF in the hope that future developments, such as stimulation of ovarian stem cells, may be of later benefit. She was not deemed a suitable candidate for gonadotropin stimulation for oocyte preservation due to the undetectable anti-Müllerian hormone level. The pathologist described the macroscopic appearance of the ovary as “cystic and disrupted.” Microscopic histology of three right ovarian biopsies reported fibrovascular connective tissue with no primordial follicles in the ovarian cortex of sample one. Ovarian sample 2 reported a cystic follicle and a cystic corpus luteum but no primordial follicles within surrounding parenchyma. Ovarian sample 3 reported “fibrofatty connective tissue only. No ovarian parenchyma is identified.” Summary: “Levels through all tissue containing ovarian parenchyma show a single primordial follicle. No other follicular structures are identified.” No samples contained evidence of atypia or malignancy (Sullivan Nicolaides Pathology. Brisbane, Queensland, Australia). Personal communication with the reporting pathologist confirmed no lymphoid or granulomatous inflammation and suggested the ovarian appearance was “consistent with that of a woman in her late forties.”
She has been counseled about bone density preservation and the need for hormone replacement therapy. This case was notified to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) of Australia in January 2014 (reference number 333136) as diagnosed POI. Its listing as “amenorrhoea” on the TGA database in May 2014 was later altered to POF (July 2014).","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 48 year old male patient was referred to a private endodontic practice for evaluation and treatment of a maxillary left lateral incisor. He complained of pain on biting and palpation in the area. Medical history was non-contributory. In his dental history, he reported that the tooth had been treated non-surgically 12 months earlier. Clinical examination revealed moderate percussion sensitivity. Periodontal probing and mobility were within normal limits when compared to contralateral and adjacent teeth. The radiographic examination revealed periapical radiolucency 7 - 8 mm in diameter along the distal surface of the root, indicative of either an accessory canal or a possible apical fracture (). The radiograph also showed a titanium screw that was used for fixation of the membrane during a previous implant placement procedure performed two years before presentation. The tooth had porcelain fused to a metal crown with good margins and esthetics. On the basis of the history and clinical and radiographic examination, a diagnosis of a previous root canal treatment with symptomatic apical periodontitis was established. The patient was offered all treatment options; he opted for microsurgical retreatment. Written consent was obtained.
The micro-surgical technique, as suggested by Kim and Kratchman, was performed in addition to creation of a bony window osteotomy. After rinsing with 0.12% chlorhexidine solution (Peridex, Zila Pharmaceuticals Inc., Phoenix, AZ, USA) for 60 seconds, the patient was administered 2 carpules of 4% articaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine (3M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany) buccal and palatal infiltration. After ensuring profound anesthesia, a full thickness sulcular flap was elevated, with one release incision distal to the left canine. The exposed site was considered a candidate for the bony window osteotomy as the cortical plate was found to be intact. The osteotomy was performed using a piezoelectric device (Piezotome 2, Acteon Satelec, Acteon Germany GmbH, Mettmann, Germany). The BS5 Tip (Acteon Satelec, Acteon Germany GmbH) was used to make an outline on the exposed cortical plate based on the measurement made on the digital radiograph and the topography of the exposed bone. Two vertical and two horizontal grooves were joined to create a bony window of approximately 6 mm by 12 mm, at the recommended setting mode of 3 with 60 mL/minute irrigation of sterile saline (). The average width of the cut was approximately 1 mm. The carved bony window was lifted off with a curved osteotome (). The bone block was stored in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) in order to keep it hydrated. The granulation tissue at the surgically exposed site was removed by curettage with bone and curved periodontal curettes until healthy bone margins were encountered and the root tip was clearly visible. A biopsy sample was sent for histologic evaluation. The denuded root was stained with methylene blue and inspected under high magnification (×16) with a surgical operating microscope (Carl Zeiss OPMI Pico, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) for a vertical root fracture or perforation. Upon curettage, the root presented with a fracture line extending from the root tip to about 4 mm along the length on the distal surface. The fractured portion of the root was eliminated during apical resection with a high-speed carbide Lindemann surgical bur (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA) at a zero degree bevel. The resected root surface was then stained again for inspection under high magnification (×16). The root-end preparation was achieved using ultrasonic surgical JetTips (B&L Biotech USA Inc., Fairfax, VA, USA), and the root-end cavity was filled with white mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA, ProRoot MTA, Dentsply Tulsa Dental, Tulsa, OK, USA) (). The bony window was repositioned (). Care was taken not to depress it into the osteotomy site but instead place it in alignment with the remaining bone in its original alignment. As the insert used with the piezoelectric to create the bone window was very thin, the bone flap was re-approximated firmly. 6-0 propylene nylon sutures (Supramid, S. Jackson Inc., Alexandria, VA, USA) were used for suturing the soft tissue. A postoperative radiograph was taken (). The patient was prescribed an oral analgesic (ibuprofen 600 mg) and instructed to rinse twice daily with a 0.2% chlorhexidine mouth rinse for 1 week. The sutures were removed 7 days after surgery.
The patient presented for follow-up at 9 () and 18 () months with radiographic signs of complete healing and no clinical signs or symptoms.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 31-year-old female patient was admitted to the vascular medicine department of the Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou for an acute ischemia of the left hand. She presented with necrosis of the intermediate and distal phalanges of the second, third, fourth and fifth fingers of her left hand.
Three days earlier, the patient turned up at the primary care center close to her home for a sudden and constant pain in her left hand. She was discharged within 2 h with painkillers. After 72 h, cyanosis and coldness of the intermediate and distal phalanges of the fingers of the left hand appeared. She then decided to consult at the Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou emergency department.
Left hand examination revealed the following injuries: cyanosis and coldness of the intermediate and distal phalanges of the fifth finger, necrosis of the distal phalanges of the second, third and fourth fingers, phlyctens of the intermediate phalanges of the second, third and fourth fingers and the proximal phalanges of the fourth finger (,). The hand was still painful with paresthesia, but without fingers paralysis. Upper limb pulses were present and symmetrical. Injection marks were noted at the bend of the right and left elbows. Cardiac auscultation was normal without any bruit that could evoke an infective endocarditis, and she had no fever. Electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm without any abnormalities.
In her medical history, she had no cardiovascular history but active smoking, as her only cardiovascular risk factor. Spontaneously, she mentioned being a drug addict, but weaned off ectasy, codein, and cannabis, and currently in a weaning off program for heroin. She had been prescribed tapered doses of buprenorphine but still used to take bromazepam and zolpidem off the counter.
The continuous Doppler confirmed the presence of flow in the left radial, ulnar and palmar arteries. A digital subtraction angiography was rapidly performed which demonstrated no run-off in the digital arteries of the second, third and fourth left fingers (). No thromboaspiration could be performed on these too small arteries. Anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin was started.
The patient was transferred to the vascular medicine department for medical therapy and further investigations. As the patient denied any recent intravenous drug injection, a complete screening for acute limb ischemia etiology was performed.
Human Immunodeficient Virus and Hepatitis B Virus serology were negative, whereas Hepatitis C Virus serology came back positive. Several analyses to find a cryoglobulinemia returned negative.
Arterial thrombophilia has been investigated in vain, with normal prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, absence of anti-cardiolipin antibodies, anti-beta2GPI antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, antinuclear antibodies, anti-double stranded DNA antibodies, anti polymorphonuclear cytoplasm antibodies. There was no antithrombin or protein S or protein C deficiency and no hyperhomocysteinemia. There was no argument for a myeloproliferative syndrome in the absence of a clinical call point (especially no mass or lymphadenopathy), the blood count was unspecialized and JAK2 mutation V617F was absent.
We also looked for an embolic arterial cause. The trans-thoracic echocardiography did not find any thrombus or any argument for an infectious endocarditis. The 24 h Holter-ECG was normal. The computed tomography performed at the emergency room did not show any atheroma on the aortic arch or atheromatous plaque on the left upper limb arteries.
Once she was arrived in our department, we started a daily treatment with iloprost, an arterial vasodilator, as well as pain medication, and local care with a protective dressing. Treatment with iloprost allowed delineation of necrosis at the intermediate and distal phalanges of the three fingers involved, and cyanosis of the fifth finger and the proximal phalanx of the fourth finger resolved. Management by an orthopedic surgical team specialized in the upper limb and hand was required for the amputation of the intermediate and distal phalanges of the three fingers involved ().
Finally, the patient acknowledged she had injected herself, 3 days before her admission, just below the fold of her left elbow with one and a half crushed tablet of zolpidem 10 mg mixed with contact lens cleaning fluid. The patient intended to do an intravenous injection, but it turned out to be an accidental brachial intra-arterial injection. The 3 days delay corresponded to the beginning of the pain and to her first consultation at the local medical center.
Antithrombotic therapy by anticoagulants was changed for antiplatelet therapy and the patient was then transferred to a vascular rehabilitation unit for complete healing of the amputation wounds. presents a timeline summary. After her discharge, the patient did not come back at follow-up consultations and was lost to follow-up despite several reminders.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 40-year-old woman on treatment for bipolar depression attended the psychiatry outpatient department on May 10, 2014. She complained of excessive tiredness for the past few days and was admitted for evaluation in view of her multiple admissions in the past. She was afebrile with normal vitals and Glasgow Coma Scale of 15. Her psychiatric history revealed bipolar depression for the past 5 years with an episode of depression in 2013. She was on tablet quetiapine 400 mg and tablet valproate 500 mg for July 15, 2013. There was no medical history of diabetes in her or her first-degree relatives. Ten months after the initiation of medication, her weight was 231 lbs (105 kg) with body mass index of 40.92 kg/m2 (height 5 feet 3 inches) indicating class III obesity.
Laboratory investigations revealed an elevated random blood sugar (RBS) value of 443 mg/dl. Urine acetone was positive (+++). Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.1 and bicarbonate 10.54 mEq/L (normal 22–26 mEq/L) and PaCO230 (normal 35–45) revealing a picture of uncompensated metabolic acidosis. Next day fasting lipid profile was done which showed elevated total cholesterol 509 mg/dl (normal <190 mg%) and triglyceride 2871 mg/dl (normal <150 mg/dl). Glycated hemoglobin was 9.2% (normal 4–6.4%) indicating poor glycemic control. Serum pancreatic amylase was 104 U/L (normal 0–137 U/L), and lipase was 114U/L (normal 0–160 U/L). Other investigations such as hemoglobin, total and differential count, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation, renal and liver function tests, lipid profile, serum sodium, and potassium were within the normal limits.
Diagnosis of DKA was made. After consultation with the physician, the patient was aggressively managed with 10 units regular insulin as bolus injection followed by 15 units plain insulin in 500 ml of 0.9% saline given as intravenous infusion at the rate of 15 drops per minute. She was also given intensive fluid management with normal saline and dextrose normal saline. When her blood glucose became 261 mg/dl, the insulin infusion was stopped, and plain insulin 8 units was given eighth hourly subcutaneously. Her fasting and postprandial blood sugars remained high on the consecutive days, and the insulin therapy was stepped up to 14 units in morning, 14 units in afternoon and 10 units at night(14-14-10) on May 17, 2014. Tablet atorvastatin 20 mg once daily was initiated in view of her deranged lipid profile. The dose of quetiapine was stepped down (18th - 300 mg, 20th - 250 mg, and 21st - 100 mg) and stopped on May 22, 2014. The RBS values on 22nd and 23rd were 76 and 90 mg%, respectively, and the patient was discharged with tablet amisulpride 200 mg twice daily and tablet metformin 1000 mg once daily.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 60-year-old man with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and mitral valve (MV) repair for endocarditis as well as an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for secondary prevention in situ was admitted with haemodynamic compromising monomorphic VT despite Bisoprolol 5 mg. His cardiovascular examination showed a mid-sternotomy scar and when in sinus rhythm the auscultation showed normal heart sounds with no murmurs. His jugular venous pressure was not raised with a blood pressure measured at 110/60 mmHg. His respiratory examination was unremarkable. A 12-lead electrocardiography documentation of the monomorphic VT (Figure ) demonstrated a right bundle branch block QRS morphology, transition in lead V4 with south-west axis, suggesting a VT exit from the LV lateral wall. Patient underwent VT ablation with three-dimensional (3D) EAM under general anaesthesia. The initial 3D-EAM of the LV was performed using the Orion catheter. After completion of the initial mapping, an ablation catheter was used for further point-by-point mapping at sites of interest. An irrigated 4-mm tip bidirectional steerable catheter (IntellaNav OI, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) was positioned in the LV for EAM via a steerable bidirectional sheath (Agilis, St. Jude Medical Inc., St. Paul, MN, USA) following an anterograde approach via a transseptal puncture.
The catheter moved freely within the LV until it became stuck. Fluoroscope suggested an extracardiac position. Contrast injection via the irrigation port of the catheters confirmed pericardial staining (Figure ), but it only became apparent on further withdraw of the catheter that the catheter was inside a coronary vein (see Figure and see ). Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed the intubation of basal LV wall with the catheter tip which then exited into the epicardial space (Figure ). The catheter was removed without any further sequelae. Subsequently the patient’s Bisoprolol was increased and underwent a VT provocation test at 5-month follow-up with a negative result.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"The patient was a 30 year-old male who was exposed to phosgene twelve hours prior to admission to a local clinic complaining of dyspnea, coughing and sputum. Auscultation of the chest revealed coarse breath sound with crackles all over the lung fields. A chest X-ray showed bilateral diffuse interstitial infiltration. The WBC were 12.3 × 103/μl. Arterial blood gases were PaO2, 50.2 mmHg, PaCO2, 37.2 mmHg, pH, 7.401. The patient was transferred to CNUH with worsening dyspnea. The vital signs on admission were blood pressure 130/70 mmHg, pulse 89/min, respiration 28/min and temperature 36.5°C. The WBC were 18.0 × 103/μl with 98% neutrophils. The LDH was 350 unit. Initial blood gas determinations on room air were, PaO2, 55.3 mmHg, PaCO2, 26.7 mmHg. pH, 7.477. Twelve hours after admission, the patient began to have progressively increasing respiratory symptoms with the respiratory rate rising to 55/min. The patient was intubated and ventilated with controlled mode. Ventilation was maintained with diazepam and vecuronium and treated with methylprednisolone and aminophylline. Three hours after ventilation, the fraction of inspired oxygen could be reduced to 0.6. After 24 hours of ventilation with 6 cmH2O PEEP, he developed subcutaneous emphysema extending into the neck and anterior chest. The PEEP could be reduced and subcutaneous emphysema and arterial oxygenation did not get-worse. On the third day, the patient could be weaned from the ventilator and extubated. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone, aminophylline and antibiotics. Pulmonary function tests were performed on the fifth day following exposure and showed a restrictive pattern and a normal diffusion capacity ().
The three other patients exposed to phosgene were transferred to CNUH and all were in their early forties. Their complaints were also shortness of breath, chest tightness without derangements of vital signs and arterial blood gases. The pertinent findings in the physical examination were bilateral crackles over the lung fields and diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest X-ray.
They were treated with supplemental oxygen by external devices, methylprednisolone, aminophylline and antibiotics. Their symptoms were gradually improved in 3 to 5 days of supportive care.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 37-year-old male presented with dysesthesia of 4 months' duration involving his both upper limbs. On enquiring further, it was revealed that his symptoms started all on a sudden before 4 months and has been gradually increasing ever since. There was no history of neck pain. There was no history of trauma to the neck. On examination, general examination was unremarkable. There were no cranial nerve palsies. Motor system examination revealed that he had Grade 5 power in both upper and lower limbs and deep tendon reflexes were normal. There was sensory loss involving upper limbs from the nape of the neck downward. Local skull and spine examination were normal.
He underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain along with cervical spine which showed an intra-axial tumor with a cystic component in the medullary region extending below to the second cervical vertebra [Figure and ]. The tumor was mildly hyperintense on T1-weighted image and hyperintense on T2-weighted image. There was minimal contrast enhancement of the cystic wall of the tumor. There was fluid level in the cavity which was hypointense on both T1 and T2 weighted images suggestive of previous hemorrhage [Figure -]. Our preoperative differential diagnosis included pilocytic astrocytoma, hemangioblastoma, and ependymoma.
He was taken up for surgery under neuromonitoring. He underwent a posterior fossa midline craniotomy along with a laminectomy of the first cervical vertebra in the prone position. The tumor was exposed in the midline. The cystic part of the tumor was let out which contained xanthochromic fluid, suggestive of previous bleeding. The tumor was soft and moderately vascular which had a well-demarcated margin with that of the normal cervical cord in the superficial part []. However, as the dissection progressed to the deeper parts, this demarcation was less well defined. The tumor was removed in piecemeal and intraoperative frozen section was done which was suggestive of high-grade glioma. The debulking of the tumor was performed during which profuse bleeding from the base was observed. A sudden drop in the transcranial motor evoked potentials as well as in blood pressure occurred associated with occurrence of arrhythmias after which the decision to proceed further was abandoned. Postoperatively, he was examined clinically and there were no new focal neurological deficits.
The histopathology of the tumor showed round cell tumor with rosette formation []. There was no evidence of calcification, necrosis, or neovascular proliferation. The MIB index was 3.7%. There was no mitosis. The tumor cells were positive for GFAP and EMA and negative for P53, synaptophysin, and NSE, suggestive of Grade 2 ependymoma.
A repeat MRI with contrast was taken [] which showed residual tumor involving the base of the excision cavity. The option of a repeat surgery or wait and watch with serial imaging was discussed with the patient. After discussions with the family, the patient decided against surgery and is now on follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 20-year-old healthy male presented to the emergency department after falling from a skateboard. He sustained blunt trauma to his right chest wall, resulting in pleuritic pain and mild dyspnea. Diagnostic workup included chest radiography (CXR), which showed no acute findings (). Further evaluation with chest computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated fractures of the right 4th through 6th ribs. Herniation of the middle lobe of the right lung was also identified on CT scan ().
The patient was admitted for observation and pain management. His pain and dyspnea improved and he was managed conservatively. A repeat CXR on hospital day two was stable, and the patient was discharged home. Ten days after discharge a follow-up chest CT scan was completed and demonstrated a decrease in herniated lung ().","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 58-year-old male presented with a 2-day history of dimmed vision on his left eye. He reported having had headaches and swollenness behind his left eye during the last week. The patient had undergone heart surgery after a myocardial infarction 9 months prior to his first visit. He was taking several prescription medications because of hypertension and stent implants in his heart. These included aspirin, ticagrelor, bisoprolol, candesartan, and atorvastatin. Except for a pollen allergy, he negated other disorders.
An eye examination revealed free eye motility in all directions and slight movement-associated pain in his left eye. BCVA was 1.0 in the right eye and 0.1 in his left eye. There was no diplopia. A RAPD was present in his left eye at the same examination. Color vision was affected in the left eye. The results of a fundus examination revealed a normal optic disc in the right eye, except adjacent ectopic myelin in the lower portion. Retina and macula were without signs of disease. Examination of the left eye revealed papillary edema. Macula and retina were normal except for small hemorrhage from a vessel in the lower fundus. Blood pressure was 150/90. Initial laboratory tests that included ESR, CRP, serum calcium, ACE, anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and syphilis screen were normal, except for a slightly elevated IgA test.
An MRI of the orbita was performed a week after his first visit to the clinic and revealed a slight edema surrounding the left optical nerve, fitting with OPN. At this time, the patient reported that his vision had normalized. Steroid treatment was therefore not initiated. Since his first visit, he reported having three episodes of lost vision in his previously unaffected right eye a few days earlier. Also present was minor pain in his left eye and a few shorter episodes of blurred vision.
At a new visit, 3 weeks after his first, vision had improved further. A slight RAPD was present in his left eye. A fundus examination revealed no edema on either eye. Two months after his initial visit, BCVA was 0.8 in his right eye and 1.0 in the left eye. A visual field test conducted at the same time revealed a small isolated central scotoma with a slightly elevated threshold in his left eye (Humphrey field test, VFI was 100% in right eye and 99% in left eye).","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 73-year-old female patient came to the outpatient department with complaints of lower abdominal pain, blood in stools, and whitish discharge through vagina for 10 days. On examination patient's vitals were stable. The patient underwent a CECT scan abdomen which revealed irregular wall thickening involving the rectosigmoid region for a length of ~ 7 cm, with wall thickness of ~ 18 mm. There was loss of fat plane between the uterus and the thickened rectosigmoid colon with air pockets within the endometrial cavity []. Mesocolic fat and perirectal fat stranding was also seen with multiple adjacent subcentimetric lymph nodes. Based on CT findings, possibility of rectosigmoid malignancy and colouterine fistula was considered. The sigmoidoscopy and biopsy of the lesion revealed infiltrating moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of colon. The en bloc resection of the uterus and sigmoid colon with colostomy was performed on the patient and adjuvant chemotherapy started.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 40-year old male patient of Moroccan origin was admitted in 2012 for diffuse lymphadenopathy confirmed with ultrasound. Blood tests revealed renal insufficiency (serum creatinine: 1.6 mg/dL, eGFR: 48 ml/min/1.73 m2), low serum C3 and C4 levels and hypergammaglobulinemia (4250 mg/dL with oligoclonal banding). Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) were positive at 1/640. Anti-dsDNA were negative. Urine tests showed proteinuria (444 mg/L). A thoraco-abdominal computed tomography and positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) were performed. The images were compatible with a lymphoproliferative disorder. Heterogeneous uptake was also noticed in kidneys. Lymph node biopsy was performed and ruled out a hematologic malignancy. Immunohistochemistry showed more than 10 IgG4+ plasma cells per high powered field (HPF) of biopsy sample with more than 40% of IgG+ plasma cells being IgG4+ (Fig. ). Serum IgG4 level was then measured at 2790 mg/dL (N < 201 mg/dL).
This episode was not the first in patient’s medical history. In 2004, the patient had been admitted for lower-limb edemas and diffuse lymphadenopathy. Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine: 3.51 mg/dL, eGFR: 24 ml/min/1.73 m2), low serum C3 and C4 levels and hypergammaglobulinemia (4590 mg/dL) had already been found. Urine tests showed high proteinuria (13800 mg/l) with hypoalbuminemia characteristic of a nephrotic syndrome. Renal ultrasound showed diffuse kidney enlargement. PET/CT showed the same results as the one performed in 2012. A lymphoproliferative disorder was excluded by whole skeleton X-Ray, bone marrow and lymph node biopsy. A renal biopsy was then performed and showed membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) with IgG and C3d deposits (Fig. ). Severe tubulo-interstitial nephropathy (TIN) with lymphoplasmocytic infiltrate (CD20+, CD3+, CD5+) was associated. Secondary causes of MGN were rejected by appropriate tests. ANA were negative at the time. The proposed diagnosis was a dysimmune state of unknown origin with secondary MGN and reactive lymphadenopathy. Treatment with glucocorticoids (GC) was started with an excellent clinical and biological response.
In 2005, a cutaneous rash appeared on the left arm and was biopsied, showing IgG and C3d deposits. GC were stopped in 2006 given the recovery of renal function. A few months later, the patient started to complain of pain, redness and swelling in small joints of the feet and hands.
In 2008, the first relapse occurred with the same clinical picture that in 2004 (nephrotic syndrome and lymphadenopathy). Full assessment was repeated yielding similar results except for renal biopsy: MGN with IgG and C3d deposits was found again but chronic interstitial nephropathy replaced the severe TIN. Indeed, a mononuclear infiltrate was present in the interstitium without clear sign of tubular involvement. A severe thrombocytopenia (platelets: 8.103/mm3) developed a few weeks later with anti-dsDNA found on blood sample (1/80). Thrombocytopenia was refractory to perfusion of immunoglobulins, GC and cyclophosphamide (CYP). Plasmapheresis and splenectomy were then performed. CYP was next continued for 6 cycles (500 mg/cycle) with good efficacy. Relapsing thrombocytopenia was successfully treated by additional regiments of immunoglobulins and GC. The last cycle of CYP was completed at the end of 2008. Thereafter, the patient experienced a long period without any problem until the next hospitalization in 2012.
In 2012, a renal biopsy was not performed again despite a new relapse of nephrotic syndrome; indeed, the 2008 biopsy had led to a macroscopic urinary hemorrhage which had required embolization. MGN was assessed again and anti-phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) antibodies were negative. Diagnosis of IgG4-RD was finally made on the basis of the lymph node biopsy, with IgG4-related generalized lymphadenopathy and IgG4-related MGN (associated with IgG4-related TIN in 2004). The patient was given GC again at high dose (methylprednisolone 96 mg daily) for 1 month followed by a progressive decrease of the dose. Rituximab use was discussed in 2013, due to a new relapse in spite of maintenance low dose GC therapy and development of side effects; unfortunately, the patient failed to obtain the reimbursement and the medication could not be given in this context. For now, the patient is well stabilized with low dose GC. Rituximab in compassionate use could be reconsidered in case of a new relapse. Figure shows the evolution of various biological markers and serum creatinine during 2013.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 67-year-old male with known case of hypertension for 10 years on Losartan and recent onset type 2 diabetes mellitus on Metformin with reasonable blood pressure and sugar control presented with history of loss of appetite, slowness of movements, decreased memory, frequent falls, and swaying to either side while walking for the last 3 months. He also gave a history of loss of appetite associated with nausea, occasional vomiting, and easy fatiguability. For his symptoms, he was taking over the counter indigenous medication for the last 6 months. He was evaluated by a neurologist, who did not notice any significant findings on examination. His cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examination was noncontributory. Neurological examination revealed the presence of ataxia, dysmetria, dysdiadokokinesia, tremors, bradycardia, and mild rigidity. A neurological diagnosis of early Parkinsonson's disease was made and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was done, which was suggestive of a encepaholapathy. There was no evidence of ischemic changes secondary to age, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus in the MRI []. His paraneoplastic panel and autoimmune markers were not contributory. (autoimmune encephalitis mosaic antibodies and paraneoplastic neuronal antibodies were all negative.)
His initial laboratory investigations showed normal hematological parameters, normal liver function tests, normocalcemia, normal electrolytes, and normal ammonia levels. His serum creatinine was high (2.2 mg/dl). The serum creatinine done 6 months back before starting the over the counter medications was normal at 1.4 mg/dl (normal range for the lab 0.9–1.5 mg/dl). Because of his worsening renal function he was evaluated by a nephrologist also. His urine examination was normal and his protein creatinine ratio was within normal range (0.12). His ultrasound of the abdomen revealed normal sized kidneys. He underwent a renal biopsy for unexplained renal dysfunction, which showed normal glomeruli with dense interstitial infiltrate consisting of mononuclear cells and eosinophils []. The electron microscopic examination revealed toxic vacuolation of the proximal tubules []. A diagnosis of interstitial nephritis with toxic proximal tubular injury was made and as the MRI was suggestive of a toxic/metabolic encepahalopathy, investigations were done to find a putative cause. As the basic metabolic evaluation did not reveal any plausible cause, a toxicology screen was asked for. The aluminum levels were above normal in the toxicology screen []. Treatment with desferroxime chelation was advised and the indigenous medicine was stopped. One month later the aluminum levels had reduced to 29.4 μg/l and the chelation was continued for another 4 weeks. A course of 6 weeks of low dose steroids (0.5 mg/kg/day) was also given for the interstitial inflammation. Currently, the patient has a normal serum creatinine (1.3 mg/dl) with complete resolution of the neurological symptoms. The cause of cerebral symptoms were believed to be because of aluminum toxicity as the symptoms resolved completely with aluminum chelation and it is speculated that the toxic proximal tubular injury can also be attributed to aluminum.
This patient developed neurological manifestations after 3 months of starting over the counter medications. His creatinine was only checked after 6 months of continuation of the medications. The complete resolution of his neurological and kidney injury simultaneously with the reduced aluminum levels (temporal association) suggests a putative role of aluminum in this patient's illness.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 44-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital complaining of a large tumor that had been accidentally pointed out in a medical examination as being an esophageal submucosal tumor. Relevant family history brought to light that his father had been diagnosed as having MEN1. Our patient had undergone total parathyroidectomy and autologous transplantation for primary hyperparathyroidism at the age of 18. His height and weight were 187 cm and 120 kg, respectively, with a body mass index of 34 kg/m2 on admission. He also complained of sleep apnea and bilateral nipple discharge. He was not aware of the hypoglycemic symptoms before the admission, but he frequently encountered the symptoms under nutritional management after the admission. Laboratory data of blood chemistry were normal as well as the tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9, whereas neuron specific γ-enolase was high (19.1 ng/ml). Hormonal examinations revealed a hypoglycemia, a hyperinsulinemia (fasting serum glucose, insulin levels, and hemoglobin A1c, 76 mg/dl, 134.5 μU/ml, and 4.5 %, respectively), a hyperprolactinemia (serum prolactin level 871.2 ng/ml), and elevated urinary catecholamines. On an enhanced thin-slice abdominal computed tomography (CT), a large tumor was detected in the pancreatic tail, showing heterogeneous enhancement with partial calcification and cystic components. Its maximum diameter was about 18 cm (Fig., ). Other than a pancreatic tail tumor, six enhanced liver tumors, a right adrenal tumor (3.9 cm in diameter), and a left adrenal tumor (2.6 cm in diameter) were found (Fig. , ). The right adrenal tumor was heterogeneously enhanced. An endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) revealed four tumors in the body and tail of the pancreas, except for the giant tumor, and abundant blood flow in all these tumors. Immunohistochemical examinations of a EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy showed that the giant pancreatic tumor and liver tumors were positive for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and CD56; thus, the tumors were diagnosed as being a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) and its liver metastases. They were NET G1 as the labeling index of Ki67 was 1.8 %. A calcium gluconate injection into the distal splenic artery during a selective intra-arterial calcium injection test resulted in a marked increase in serum insulin and C-peptide. Both 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy and 131I-adosterol scintigraphy showed high radioactivity in the right adrenal tumor and no radioactivity in the left one. The left adrenal tumor was therefore diagnosed as having a non-functional adenoma. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified a heterogeneous pituitary adenoma, 3.1 cm in diameter.
His pedigree diagram is shown in Fig. . Five patients with MEN1, including our patient who has an MEN1 gene mutation, were identified within his family. Furthermore, the genetic examination revealed a deletion mutation (g.249_252delGTCT) at codons 83–84 in exon 2. He underwent distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, cholecystectomy, right adrenalectomy, abdominal subcutaneous tumor excision, and cutaneous tumor biopsy for the purpose of tumor volume reduction. Six tumors in the resected pancreas were diagnosed as being pancreatic NETs. The giant tumor in the pancreatic tail was insulinoma, and NET G2 as the Ki67 labeling index was 4.2 % (Fig. ). Of the other five lesions, two tumors consisted of the insulin-positive tumor cells with less than 0.1 % of the Ki67 index, and three tumors consisted of the glucagon-positive tumor cells with less than 0.1 % of the Ki67 index. These tumors were diagnosed as being non-functional NET G1 because no symptom due to a glucagon excess was encountered. A non-functional adrenal cortical adenoma, measuring 1.3 cm in maximum diameter, and a pheochromocytoma, measuring 4.7 cm in maximum diameter, coexisted in the right adrenal gland (Fig. ). The abdominal subcutaneous tumor was found to be a neurofibroma, and the cutaneous tumor was a fibroma.
During the postoperative outpatient follow-up, he developed diabetes mellitus and required treatment with an oral antidiabetic drug. For the treatment of his pituitary prolactinoma, cabergoline was administered. Octreotide therapy for the multiple liver metastases of the NETs began 2 months after the operation. After the ninth administration of the octreotide, three new lesions were detected in the liver on a CT scan. His general condition was judged to be tolerable to undergo liver resection, and the radiological examinations showed that there was no recurrence except the liver. Complete surgical resection of liver metastases was therefore achieved by an extended right posterior segmentectomy with partial hepatectomy of S2, S3, and S8. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that liver metastases were derived from a glucagon-positive tumor of the pancreatic NET. The Ki67 labeling index of these lesions ranged from 1.5 to 5.4 %.
Nineteen months after the hepatectomy, a CT scan revealed a small nodule in the S4 of the liver. Twenty-three months after the hepatectomy, gadoxetic acid- or gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced MRI demonstrated multiple liver tumors. We started everolimus therapy following a diagnosis of unresectable pancreatic NET recurrence. He is still alive after 4 years and 4 months after the initial surgery, although he is suffering from worsened diabetes mellitus, a pituitary prolactinoma that led to a hemorrhage into the pituitary tumor, and an increasing size of the left nonfunctional adrenal tumor.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 58-year-old female presented with a chief complaint of left hip pain of 5 months’ duration. The patient had been seen approximately 10 months prior to presentation, shortly after experiencing a “clunk” in her right hip. She reported that her pain was stable and had not increased since that episode. Relevant history included a left primary THA approximately 25 years ago. The patient also reported a right primary THA at the age of 33 years, followed by a head and liner exchange 10 years later due to poly wear and broken tine. A right total knee arthroplasty procedure was performed approximately 1 year ago. Comorbid conditions reported included degenerative joint disease, thrombocytopenia, cirrhosis of the liver, lumbar spondylosis and anemia. The patient had been managing any ongoing hip pain with anti-inflammatories and routine monitoring of poly wear with annual radiographs.
On physical examination, a pain-free range of motion (ROM) of the affected hip was noted, although the patient demonstrated hesitation at the extremes of motion. Slightly reduced ROM was noted with internal and external rotation when compared with the right hip. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were normal. Radiographs were obtained and revealed severe polyethylene wear and asymmetry in the left hip (). Some acetabular and proximal femoral lysis was noted, although there was no change in the acetabulofemoral component interface.
The pre-operative plan for this patient was to exchange the polyethylene liner only; however, during surgery, it was observed that the locking mechanism on the poly component was incompetent. Furthermore, intraoperative measurement with the navigation system indicated anteversion of 5° (radiographic definition), revealing a cup component significantly more retroverted than the 18° indicated by the pre-operative radiograph (). A decision was made to exchange both the liner and the cup component ().
Surgery was successful, and post-operatively, the patient was prescribed standard posterior hip precautions with toe-touch weight-bearing for 6 weeks. At 2 weeks post-op, the patient was progressing well.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 36-year-old, nulligravida, unwanted for pregnancy was referred to our hospital due to persistent dysmenorrhea and lower back pain following a bilateral uterine artery embolization and intrauterine device (Mirena) insertion at a local clinic. A pelvic magnetic resonance imaging showed a 5-cm-heterogeneous mass on the posterior uterine wall, which appeared to be an intramural fibroid. After thorough counseling on the potential risks and benefits of the procedure and the possible alternative surgical treatments was the laparoscopic ultrasound-guided RFA performed under general anesthesia. A dense adhesion was found in the right cul-de-sac between uterus and colon. Adhesiolysis and biopsies were performed of the adhesive band and peritoneum and an endometriosis was later confirmed. A 16-gauge RFA needle was percutaneously inserted and placed within the target fibroid under laparoscopic video and transvaginal ultrasound guidance. The RF delivery system (M1004, RF Medical Co., Seoul, Korea) was applied twice with a maximum power of 120 watt and a maximum temperature of 85℃ for 5 minutes. The patient was discharged without any complications. However, she visited the hospital for bloody anal discharge and vaginal leakage of stool after two weeks of discharge. During her visit were the vital signs stable, but a leukocytosis (white blood cell 12,820/µL) and an elevation of C-reactive protein (1.4 mg/dL) were observed. The colonoscopy showed a white, marginal protruding mucosal defect about 9 cm above the anal verge (). A pelvic computed tomography and a hysterosalpingogram revealed a fistula between the posterior uterine wall and the rectum (). The patient underwent a rectal fistula wedge resection and ileostomy and total abdominal hysterectomy due to severe inflammation and necrosis in the uterine cavity. Two months later, the fluoroscopic examination of the pouchgram showed an improved rectouterine fistula and no leakage of contrast media, thus a take-down of the ileostomy was performed. There was no further clinical problem afterward for one year of follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 73-year-old female patient came to the outpatient department with complaints of lower abdominal pain, blood in stools, and whitish discharge through vagina for 10 days. On examination patient's vitals were stable. The patient underwent a CECT scan abdomen which revealed irregular wall thickening involving the rectosigmoid region for a length of ~ 7 cm, with wall thickness of ~ 18 mm. There was loss of fat plane between the uterus and the thickened rectosigmoid colon with air pockets within the endometrial cavity []. Mesocolic fat and perirectal fat stranding was also seen with multiple adjacent subcentimetric lymph nodes. Based on CT findings, possibility of rectosigmoid malignancy and colouterine fistula was considered. The sigmoidoscopy and biopsy of the lesion revealed infiltrating moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of colon. The en bloc resection of the uterus and sigmoid colon with colostomy was performed on the patient and adjuvant chemotherapy started.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 31-year-old white male presented with a progressive spastic quadriparesis over 1-year duration. Four years previously, he had fallen from a horse into a tree called Mandacaru (Cereus jamaracu) in northeast Brazil. At the time of the injury, the patient had several skin wounds but no neurological symptoms or signs. Four years later, he presented with new onset of spastic tetraparesis characterized by motor 4/5 strength in the upper and lower limbs; he could only ambulate with assistance.
While plain radiographs of cervical spine revealed upper cervical kyphosis, computed tomography (CT) scan [] demonstrated a foreign body resembling a needle that entered the spinal canal through the left C3-C4 foramen. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [] demonstrated extensive edema in the cervical spinal cord and enhancement with gadolinium of tissue surrounding the foreign body.
The needle was removed utilizing a left side approach to the left C3-C4 foramen. (Hodgson-like approach[] posterior-lateral view).
A 5-cm thorn was removed []; of interest, there was no cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. The postoperative course was uneventful and he continued to improve over the next 6 months.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"In August 2019, a six-year-old male patient manifested right eye (RE) excessive tearing, conjunctival injection and pain. Family history was unremarkable. The child was born after uncomplicated twin pregnancy, in 37th gestational week, but ultrasound assessment was consistent with 34th maturity week. Birth weight was 2100 g and Apgar score 9/10. Photographs before the event depicted isocoria without anterior segment asymmetry.
On examination, RE demonstrated visual acuity of light perception and intraocular pressure (IOP) of 36 mmHg. Left eye showed no abnormalities. The diagnoses of neovascular glaucoma, CRVO and CRAO were established as affirmed with fluorescein angiography (FA). Extensive systemic work-up was performed. Neurological and cardiologic examinations were unremarkable. Laboratory tests for tuberculosis, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma gondii, rubella, herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2, and HIV were negative, as well as factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation, MTHFR gene, anticardiolipin antibodies, and lupus anticoagulant. PHA was not reported in any of the findings. The child’s condition was perceived as idiopathic CRAO and CRVO, which led to the development of neovascular glaucoma. The patient was treated with antiglaucoma drugs topically (dorzolamide + timolol 20 mg/L + 5 mg/L drops b.i.d., latanoprost 50 μg/mL drops q.d., and acetazolamide 250 mg q.d.), panretinal photocoagulation, ranibizumab intravitreally and cyclophotocoagulation.
In December 2019, the child was referred to our Centre for second opinion. Clinical examination showed no light perception. The slit-lamp indirect lateral illumination revealed fully dilated, non-reactive RE pupil (Fig. a). Retroillumination verified blood cells in the HA lumen and anterior vitreous (Fig. b). RE IOP was 38 mmHg. Brückner’s transillumination revealed dim red reflex and tubular remnant of HA freely rotating in the anterior vitreous (Additional file 1). Closed angle and clear lens were depicted using ultrasound biomicroscopy (Fig. c). Extensive subhyaloid and intravitreal haemorrhages obscured visualization of fundus periphery and posterior pole (Fig. d). Thus, RE optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography could not be performed. Ultrasound B-scan affirmed low reflective membranous tubular structure of the persistent hyaloid artery extending freely into the vitreous demonstrating substantial after-movements (Fig. e). It originated within the optic nerve head measuring 4.92 × 1.08 mm (Fig. f).
Vascular occlusion incident was discerned as a consequence of the existence of patent HA in the highly mobile Cloquet’s canal. No therapeutic intervention was currently indicated, but only close follow-up because the patient did not complain of any eye pain.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8. Exclusion Criteria: Patients with pre-existent terminal renal insufficiency, Known glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (risk of hemolysis), History of urolithiasis, oxalate nephropathy or hemochromatosis, Treatment limitations.",1
"In another case, a 73-year-old female with a long smoking history was referred to thoracic surgery for a slow-growing nodule in her left upper lobe. A CT scan showed a 2.3 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm GGO nodule in the anterior left upper lobe (Figure ). At this time, a three-month follow-up was recommended. A repeat scan showed unchanged size and configuration of the nodule. The patient was recommended to follow-up in six months, but she did not return for almost a year. At that time, a biopsy was performed showing alveolar atypia consistent with AAH (Figure ). A repeat CT was performed six months following the biopsy and the nodule became ""semisolid"" with both solid and GGO features here (Figure ). At no time did any of the CT scans demonstrate mediastinal adenopathy or other abnormality. The patient's case was presented at the multi-disciplinary tumor board and surgical consultation was recommended.
Upon presentation to thoracic surgery, the patient continued to smoke. She denied any symptoms of cough, weight loss, or change in appetite. Given the location and concerns for potential malignancy within the previously identified atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, the patient was consented for lobectomy. The patient underwent an uneventful left upper lobectomy and lymph node dissection. Final pathology showed two foci of invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, acinar pattern (Figure -). Multiple lymph nodes were positive for malignancy including 4L, 11L and other peribronchial nodes with no evidence of distant metastases or brain metastases on CT and PET scan. The patient’s final pathology demonstrated her to be T3N2M0. She was referred to medical oncology for chemotherapy and radiation oncology for radiation.
Together these cases demonstrate the varying opinions on clinical management of AAH and to date, there is no empiric treatment for AAH. Traditional treatment options include surgical resection or observation with serial CT scans. The role of SBRT is unknown due to lack of data on the use of SBRT in treating AAH. In addition, the latter case demonstrates that AAH can act as precursor lesion of adenocarcinoma.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 69-year-old man was referred to our clinic in August, 2006 presenting with decreased visual acuity in his right eye. He had been diagnosed with CIMF in July, 2000 and continued to have supportive care for CIMF throughout his follow-up. He had no specific ocular history and no history of irradiation. Visual acuities were 20/25 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left. Slit lamp examination showed no abnormalities on the conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber and iris. Fundus examination disclosed a mild vitreous hemorrhage in the right eye (). The peripheral fundi of both eyes showed marked vessel occlusion and microaneurysms in the temporal area. Fluorescein angiography in both eyes showed arteriovenous anastomosis with a marked area of nonperfusion and multiple sea-fan neovascularization on both eyes (). On laboratory examination, hemoglobin was 4.9 g/dL, platelet count was 63,000/mm3, and white blood cell count was 2,500/mm3 (with no blast cells). A peripheral blood smear test showed teardrop-shaped red cells. His fasting blood sugar value was normal, and the hemoglobin electrophoresis study was negative. Bone marrow examination showed hypocellular marrow with severe fibrosis and osteosclerosis (cellularity 11-20%), and no Philadelphia chromosome or BCR/ABL gene rearrangement was found.
In view of these findings, photocoagulation of the peripheral avascular retina of the left eye and laser photocoagulation with pars plana vitrectomy of the right eye were performed. Intraoperative findings were mild vitreous hemorrhage with a diffuse traction membrane around the temporal avascular retina. The vitreous hemorrhage and traction membrane were removed and laser photocoagulation was performed. Four weeks after surgery, his visual acuities were 20/25 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left, fundus examination of the right eye revealed no vitreous hemorrhage, and the retinal neovascularization had regressed in both eyes with good laser scars ().","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"The patient is a 75-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history of major depressive disorder who presented to the emergency department for altered mental status. She was brought in by ambulance after the patient developed acute aphasia and was unresponsive to verbal commands. She had developed generalized weakness, decreased oral intake, and recurrent falls over the past several weeks. Over the previous year, she had been increasingly developing abnormal dietary habits, including obsessively eating canned peaches, dairy products such as milk and cheese, and refusing to eat any leafy green vegetables. However, her mentation remained sharp, as she was able to have meaningful and in-depth conversations, up to until her recent symptoms had developed. Her initial vital signs indicated a temperature of 86.7 degrees Fahrenheit via rectal thermometer, hypertensive at 154/60 mmHg, bradycardic at 48 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/minute, and saturating 99% on room air. On physical exam, she was responsive only to painful stimulation, with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 8. However, she was able to spontaneously move all of her extremities and intermittently opened her eyes. Initial laboratory values were significant for hyponatremia of 120 mmol/L (reference range 135 - 145 mmol/L), glucose of 69 mg/dL (reference range of 74 - 106 mg/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count of 1.22 1000/uL (reference range of 4.50 - 10.50 1000/uL), ammonia was within normal limits as was the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (Table ).
Initial CT scan of the head revealed a questionable hypodensity in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) distribution in the temporal region. She was started on a forced-air warming blanket and admitted to the intensive care unit for concern for a cerebral vascular accident and hypothermia. Subsequent MRI of the brain revealed no acute intracranial findings, including no acute infarct. Mild fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintense foci within the supratentorial white matter was noted. Electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed continuous generalized slowing that was suggestive of moderate encephalopathy (Figure ).
Lumbar puncture revealed a mildly elevated cerebrospinal fluid total protein of 53 mg/dL (reference range of 15-45 mg/dL) and glucose of 71 mg/dL (reference range of 40-70 mg/dL). Her hypothermia resolved and she was transferred to the general medicine wards, however, her mentation did not improve. She remained unresponsive to verbal commands, responded only to painful stimuli, and appeared to develop nuchal rigidity, with a flat affect. Lorazepam was administered to treat for possible catatonia, however, her symptoms did not improve. Given her previous history of malnutrition, she was administered intravenous high-dose thiamine (Vitamin B₁). The following day, the patient’s mentation had improved significantly. She was able to answer questions and hold conversations. She still had partial confusion, but was alert and oriented to person and time. Her family confirmed that her improvement was closer to how she was behaving prior to admission. Subsequently, she suffered a series of mechanical falls as a consequence of persistent gait ataxia. Following her falls, her level of alertness and speed of cognition continued to improve. As her cognition returned she began to question the daily plans told to her by her physicians, physical therapists, and even her family. While some of what she said included confabulation, she rapidly became more oriented to the events around her. By the time she was deemed stable for discharge, she was able to clearly explain why she was in the hospital, as well as her post-discharge plan, but she was not able to recall events that took place during the three weeks leading up to her admission. Afterward, she was discharged home.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 36-year-old-man without a medical history of pulmonary tuberculosis or BCG vaccination was admitted for dysphonia and dysphagia for 6 months. Laryngoscopic examination revealed thickening of the left vocal cord and the ventricular strip, with edema. Laryngeal CT scan [Figures and ] revealed a localized, regular thickening of the left vocal cord, associated with irregular thickening of the posterior laryngeal wall. The anterior commissure and sub-glottic region were normal. There were neither any cartilaginous abnormalities nor any cervical adenopathy. A biopsy was performed, which revealed caseo-follicular tuberculosis laryngitis. The chest radiograph and abdominal USG were normal. On further interrogation and investigations, it was found that the patient was negative for the human immunodeficiency virus and his sputum was negative for acid-fast bacilli.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 75-year-old woman with a medical history of hypertension presented at another institution with fecal occult blood, and a colonoscopy showed a type II tumor in the sigmoid colon. She was referred to our hospital for tumor resection, where colonoscopy determined that the tumor was located 23 cm from the anal verge. Histopathology of a biopsy specimen revealed a moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. Enhanced computed tomography of the thorax and abdomen showed sigmoid colon wall thickening. Regional lymph node metastasis was suspected, but no evidence of distant metastasis was observed. A blood examination revealed an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentration (32.7 ng/ml). Following a diagnosis of cancer of the sigmoid colon, clinical stage IIIb [cT4a, N1b, M0], a laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy was performed without complications. The postoperative histopathological examination revealed a moderately differentiated to mucinous adenocarcinoma. Three of the 16 retrieved lymph nodes contained malignant cells. Finally, the cancer was classified as stage IIIb [pT4a, pN1b, M0]. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged 10 days after the surgery. Following the diagnosis of stage III colorectal cancer, the patient was recommended to receive adjuvant chemotherapy with CAPOX starting 4 weeks after surgery. The selected regimen consisted of capecitabine (1,000 mg/m2 orally twice daily) for 14 days and L-OHP (130 mg/m2 intravenous infusion) on the first day of each cycle, with a periodicity of 3 weeks over 3 months (four cycles). The anticancer drug dosage was reduced to 80% because of the patient's age. The patient had postoperative physical weakness and appetite loss, and also received 7.5 g of NYT daily throughout the course of adjuvant chemotherapy. She did not report any events of peripheral loss of appetite, general fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia, or febrile neutropenia. Adverse effects were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0. She has not experienced any recurrence during a 1-year postoperative follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"Case 3: a 74-year-old woman with CKD on HD was admitted to the ICU after surgical clipping for intracranial arterial aneurysm. Intermittent HD was undergone postoperatively, and PSP ranged from 1,240–1,935 without sepsis symptoms. Clinical data from her ICU stay are listed in Table (case 3). Temporary elevation of CRP or PCT was also observed, while SIRS and APACHE II values did not change postoperatively (Table (case 3)). Bacteria were not isolated in blood culture, and normal florae were isolated in oral culture (Table (case 3)). Postoperative complications were not observed, and the patient’s clinical prognosis was good.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 29-year-old Japanese woman was admitted with lowered consciousness and a high fever (>39°C), arthralgia, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy that had persisted for a week. She had a history of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and macrophage activation syndrome when she was 9 years old and was treated with oral prednisolone until she was 15 years old. Brain MRI showed bilateral swelling and high signal intensity in the basal ganglia and thalamus according to T2-weighted images and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (shown in Fig. , b). Blood examinations revealed the following: leukocyte count, 5,100/μL (88% neutrophils); hemoglobin, 14.3 g/dL; platelets, 110,000/μL; C-reactive protein, 5.36 mg/dL; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 29 mm/h; slightly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, 84 U/L, and alanine aminotransferase, 16 U/L), elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor, 1,261 U/mL, and an elevated serum ferritin level of 4,088 ng/mL (reference range, 5–152 ng/mL). The kidney function test results were within normal limits, the antinuclear antigen was at the borderline level, and the rheumatoid factor and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody tests were negative. Her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on admission showed an opening pressure of 7 cm H2O, 7 cells/mm3 (71% lymphocytes), increased protein levels (265 mg/dL; normal, <40 mg/dL), and a slightly low glucose level (48 mg/dL; normal, >50 mg/dL). Blood, urine, and CSF cultures were negative. Viral meningitis (human herpesvirus 1–6) was excluded using CSF in a polymerase chain reaction assay. An extensive infectious disease evaluation was negative. Her consciousness disorder improved without treatment, and her brain MRI also showed an improvement 3 weeks after admission (shown in Fig. , d). Nevertheless, a high fever, arthritis, and salmon-colored rash on her trunk and limbs persisted (shown in Fig. ). Abdominal CT revealed splenomegaly.
After excluding infections, malignancies, and other rheumatic diseases, ASD was diagnosed based on the presence of fever, arthritis, rash, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and hepatic dysfunction, according to the Yamaguchi criteria []. Her schistocytosis and worsening of anemia (hemoglobin, 8.7 g/dL) became clinically evident, and oral prednisolone of 45 mg (1 mg/day/kg) was administered. TMA was ruled out because of her normal platelet count (162,000/μL), normal kidney function (creatinine, 0.60), and normalized fever without any neurological signs. After administering oral prednisone for 2 days, the patient presented with blurred vision in the left eye and was referred to the ophthalmology department. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/17 in each eye, and her intraocular pressure was normal at the initial visit. A slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment of the eye was unremarkable. A funduscopic examination revealed bilateral cotton-wool spots, Purtscher flecken, and a small number of intraretinal hemorrhages around the optic nerve and in the posterior pole (shown in Fig. ), which were compatible with Purtscher-like retinopathy []. Optical coherence tomography showed inner retinal thickening consistent with cotton-wool spots in both eyes (shown in Fig. ). Fundus fluorescein angiography showed hypofluorescence in the early phase and increased permeability in the late phase, consistent with the lesions (shown in Fig. ). There was no apparent nonperfusion area in either eye.
Despite treatment with high-dose oral prednisolone for 2 weeks, her laboratory data gradually worsened, showing elevated serum ferritin levels (5,663 ng/mL) and developed macrophage activation syndrome []. Therefore, intravenous pulse methylprednisolone therapy was initiated at 1,000 mg/day for 5 days, followed by oral prednisolone of 90 mg (2 mg/kg/day). Nine days after the administration of intravenous pulse methylprednisolone therapy, the patient's serum ferritin levels dropped to 462 ng/mL, and aspartate aminotransferase levels and the platelet count fell within normal limits. TCZ (8 mg/kg every week during hospitalization and 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks after discharge) was administered considering the severity of ASD (shown in Fig. ). The patient visited the ophthalmology department again 15 days after the administration of intravenous pulse methylprednisolone therapy, and her funduscopic examination revealed reduced bilateral cotton-wool spots and Purtscher flecken (shown in Fig. ). Her ASD was successfully treated, and the oral prednisolone treatment was tapered. Although her Purtscher-like retinopathy improved as her ASD activity decreased, nerve fiber layer defect (NFLD) in both eyes appeared 7 months after initial visit (shown in Fig. ). Humphrey visual field testing showed visual field defect corresponding to NFLD (shown in Fig. ). At her last visit, that was 1 year after the administration of intravenous pulse methylprednisolone therapy, the patient was taking prednisolone (5 mg/day) and continuing TCZ, and she remained in good health without a major ASD flare.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 51-year-old man with known mild, bilateral nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy was referred for evaluation of CRAO that had developed in his left eye 72 hours prior to presentation. His past medical history included systemic arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus for the past 15 years.
On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 0.6 in the right eye and hand motion in the left eye. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 14 mmHg bilaterally by Goldmann applanation tonometry. Anterior segment evaluation showed no NVI in the left eye, and both eyes had open angles. Fundus examination showed midperipheral retinal hemorrhages in both eyes. In the left eye, the retina was pale with attenuated arteries and a cherry red spot at the posterior pole. An intravenous fluorescein angiogram showed a delayed arm-to-retina time of 25 seconds and incomplete retinal venous filling throughout the test (>6 minutes). Choroidal perfusion was normal. Noninvasive carotid examination delineated 70% stenosis in the left proximal internal carotid artery and plaques in both internal carotid arteries.
Five weeks later, on routine follow-up examination, he returned complaining of ocular pain in his left eye for the previous three days. The visual acuity in the left eye had decreased to no light perception, and the IOP was 45 mmHg. Neovascularization of the iris and angle was noted in the left eye. The retinal whitening and cherry red spot were still present.
Despite maximal tolerable medical therapy to control intraocular pressure, the patient experienced marked discomfort. Treatment options were explained in detail, and after the patient gave consent, an intravitreal injection of 0.75 mg (0.03 ml) of bevacizumab was performed in a sterile fashion without anterior chamber paracentesis. One week later, there was a complete regression of the NVI, and the IOP had decreased to 25 mmHg with two topical antiglaucoma medications (dorzolamide/timolol fixed combination and brimonidine). PRP consisting of a total of 1200 burns was administered in three sessions starting two weeks after the injection. Over the next three months, recurrent NVI developed, and the patient received another IVB injection and additional PRP. Over the course of treatment, the patient received 2000 burns in all. Two months after the additional combination therapy, there was no recurrence of NVI, and the IOP was 21 mmHg with the same medications.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"We present the case of a white, Hispanic, 58-year-old, non-smoker female. She has a past medical history of obstructive sleep apnea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis). Her travel history includes the Dominican Republic and Caribbean Islands. She worked for several years in an automobile repair shop and was exposed to lead and paint. Her current occupation is as a telephone operator in a call center, which requires her to speak continually.
Fifteen years ago, she developed a progressive cough. During the following four years, she was evaluated by more than eight pulmonologists who were unable to make a diagnosis. She developed a productive cough with white sputum and blood titer. Her alpha-1-antitrypsin serum, perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (P-ANCA), cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (C-ANCA), and rheumatoid factor were all within normal limits. Her purified protein derivative (PPD) and fungal infection tests were negative. Lung function tests revealed an obstructive pattern. Her forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) was 70% and total lung capacity (TLC) was 72%. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed mild ground glass infiltrates in the lung bases (Figure ).
Finally, in December 2011, a lung biopsy via assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was performed, and she was diagnosed with constrictive bronchiolitis and diffuse idiopathic neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia with carcinoid tumorlets. She was treated with octreotide; however, the treatment was interrupted several times due to issues with insurance and difficulties visiting the medical center. Her treatment was restarted in our hospital after three years in May 2014. Since then, CT scans taken every six months show a stable disease. She currently has a stable radiographic disease with no new complaints during the over two years of follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"The case was of a 22-year-old woman complaining of headache for 18 months with severe episodes lasting around 6 hours, recurring about twice a month. Pain was located on the parietal regions, spreading to the orbit. Attacks were accompanied by nausea severe enough to hinder routine activities. The case was assessed by several specialists ruling out neurological, ophthalmological, and otorhinolaryngological pathologies. Cranial computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no pathology. Previous treatments considered nonsteroidal analgesics, physical therapy, hot and ice packs applications, and low-level laser therapy. All of them did not relieve pain to a satisfactory level. Her neurologist referred her to the orthodontic clinic suspecting a dilemma somewhere in her braces. The patient had fixed orthodontic appliance in the lower arch only with right first premolar extracted and space was closed with a satisfactory treatment outcome.
Clinical examination showed good oral hygiene with no signs of periodontal disease. Panoramic radiography (OPG) was normal. Occlusion was normal with no temporomandibular joint disorders. However, the patient reported that headache started 4 weeks after brackets bonding. At this stage, the patient was referred to a specialized center to test salivary biochemistry, particularly nickel and chromium levels. The chemical analyses were performed with a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer using unstimulated salivary sample.
After consultation with patient's neurologist, a decision was made to remove braces as soon as possible and provide her with a CAD/CAM zirconium bar as a bonded mandibular fixed retainer as the patient refused to wear any removable appliance. The treatment objectives were to (1) remove braces and retain teeth at their present position and (2) fabricate a bonded mandibular fixed retainer being biocompatible in attempt to relieve the patient's complaint.
Occlusal rests of 2 mm depth were prepared on the mesial surface of first premolars. Brackets were covered with wax prior to impression taking to facilitate its removal. A definitive impression of the mandibular teeth was made with an alginate impression material and the master model was prepared from type IV stone (ResinRock, Whip Mix Europe, Dortmund, Germany). The working cast was mounted on articulator and scanned in the S600 ARTI scanner (Ice Zirkon, Zirkonzahn-ZA9246A, Italy) to transfer the baseline landmarks from the mandibular arch directly to the software (). The CAD/CAM design included a 1.8 mm width and a 1.4 mm thickness zirconium bar extended on the lingual surface of lower teeth from canine to canine and at 3.5 mm away from the free gingival margin. Occlusal rests were connected to the bar as well (). The finished design was directly milled using Zirkonzahn's Screw-Tec system.
Zirconium does not chemically adhere to enamel; therefore, the inner surface of the milled bar facing teeth was reduced manually and placed under an infrared lamp to dry for 40 minutes and then sintered overnight at 1,600°C in a sintering furnace Zirkonofen 700. Later, a thin layer of feldspathic ceramic was fired onto the bar () and subsequently received the treatments sandblast, hydrofluoric acid etching, and silane coupling while the outer part was glazed (). The try of insertion of the entire bar into the patient's mouth proceeded properly ensuring good marginal fitness. The retainer was cemented with two dual-cured cement types (Variolink II and RelyX ARC). The occlusal rest on the left side needed minimal reduction ().
Salivary spectrophotometry analysis showed that nickel concentration was 4.230 μg/L and chromium was 12.520 μg/L. These concentrations were much lower than estimated toxic levels but comparable to the average dietary intake of nickel (200–300 μg/day) and chromium (280 μg/day) []. Several in vitro studies found that release reached a maximum within the first month of boding and then diminished due to formation of surface oxide film which resists corrosion, thus slowing down the release of metals []. However, the case is different here where measurable amounts of nickel and chromium release were recorded after 22 months of treatment alerting possible association with the complaint.
The patient reported pain relief two weeks following cementation, and headache subsided completely after 6 weeks. Another atomic absorption spectrometer analysis was performed to test salivary nickel and chromium levels which showed negligible concentrations which might explain the patient's complaint. The patient was reviewed regularly for two years reporting no complaint (). Clinical evaluation appeared to give good functional value where the marginal fit of digitized CAD/CAM design and glazed surface offered an enhanced approach of fixed retention.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 60-year-old male retired soldier presented with a 4-month history of recurrent low-grade fever, cough, abdominal distention and remarkable weight loss. He was chronically ill looking, wasted, moderately pale, splenomegaly of 16 cm, and hepatomegaly of 6 cm. Haematological investigation showed packed cell volume (PCV) of 21.7% (37.0-53.0%), total white blood cell (WBC) count of 30.5 × 109/L (3.0-13.2 × 109/L) with differentials of granulocyte of 36.3%, lymphocyte 53.6%, medium sized (MID) 10.1%. Platelet count was 324 × 109/L. Other investigations revealed erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) ˃80 mm in the first hour. Chest radiograph (hilar opacities), mantoux test (negative) and sputum acid bacilli (negative). The patient was then classified as smear-negative tuberculosis. He was then placed on empirical anti tuberculosis therapy according to the Nigerian national guideline for tuberculosis therapy. However, there was no clinical response after 4 weeks.
On haematological review he was found to be emaciated, mildly pale, mildly dehydrated without significant peripheral lymphadenopathy. The chest was clinically clear, and the cardio-vascular system was stable. He has an enlarged spleen measuring 24 cm below the left coastal margin. Repeat haematological investigations revealed a PCV of 20.8%, WBC count of 48.8 × 109/L differentials were neutrophils 70%, lymphocyte 8%, monocyte 4%, band forms 2%, metamyelocyte 10% and myelocyte 6%. The platelet count was 769 × 109/L. The peripheral blood film showed 416 nucleated red blood cells (NRBC) per 100 WBC, macrothrombocyte, leuco-erythroblastosis, tear drop poikilocytes, target cells, fragment cells and hypogranular granulocyte with bizarre segmentation. Bone marrow aspiration (BMA) revealed myeloid:Erythroid reversal and increased megakaryocytopoiesis. Biopsy findings were consistent with increase dysplastic megakaryocyte and moderate fibrosis.
These laboratory and clinical findings led to a diagnosis of CML (accelerated phase) to rule out cellular phase of myelofibrosis (MF); thus, cytoreductive therapy was started with hydroxyurea (HU) for 3 months while awaiting results of molecular biologic test. The test turned out positive for BCR-ABL1 (e14a2/e13a2) 61.6%. The patient was then commenced on Imatinib at 400 mg once daily. However, response to Imatinib was sub-optimal; thus, JAK2 analysis was requested on the same sample, and it turned out to be positive for the JAK2 mutation (exon14V617F). He was then maintained on Imatinib, blood transfusion support, erythropoietin and regular follow-up, but the patient died in a peripheral hospital about 10 months after diagnosis.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"An 83-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) with upper abdominal chest pain with newly deranged liver function tests (LFTs) and raised inflammatory markers. On examination, he was found to be tender in the right upper quadrant as well as in the epigastrium. His LFTs were as follows: unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin were both 26 and 14 µmol/L, respectively; ALP, GGT, ALT, and AST were 333, 557, 194, and 158 U/L, respectively. His white cell count was 13.9 × 109/L, and CRP was 105 mg/L. A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed due to his atypical presentation to the emergency department, which showed cholecystitis with a distended gallbladder containing a 21 mm solitary lamellated calcified calculus. This was then confirmed on abdominal ultrasound, which, in addition to the above findings, showed that there was no evidence of choledocholithiasis or biliary duct dilatation.
The patient underwent LC, performed by a senior surgical trainee with an intraoperative cholangiogram showing no filling defects in the biliary ducts and free flow of contrast into the duodenum. During the operation, the gallbladder was inadvertently opened whilst dissecting it from the liver bed, resulting in spillage of the large calculus. While retrieving the gallbladder specimen in an endoscopic bag, the spilled calculus was left inadvertently in the peritoneal cavity. The operator did not realize that the spilled stone was unretrieved. The patient made an uneventful, gradual recovery and was discharged on postoperative day 1. Macroscopic histopathology report revealed a partially opened gallbladder with no gallstone within the lumen, suggesting that the spilled large calculus was not retrieved from the peritoneal cavity. Microscopically, it was consistent with acute and chronic cholecystitis with muscle hypertrophy and fibrosis of the wall.
The patient re-presented to the emergency department 3 weeks after discharge with central abdominal pain, anorexia, and vomiting. He had been experiencing these symptoms since day 3 of discharge, and they had been getting worse until the time he re-presented. In spite of these symptoms, he was systemically well. Examination of the abdomen revealed minimally distended abdomen with tenderness in the periumbilical region. These symptoms and signs suggested that he had small bowel obstruction. However, in the setting of recent cholecystectomy, we wanted to rule out the possibility of a biliary injury. His LFTs and inflammatory markers were normal. His symptoms were further evaluated with a CT scan, which showed evidence of SBO with transition point in the right iliac fossa. The obstruction was from a laminated calcified structure applying extrinsic compression on a loop of small bowel. With the knowledge of the index operation and the pathology report of the retrieved specimen, it was suspected that this structure was the unretrieved gallstone. This calculus was associated with a surrounding phlegmon, evidenced by intense inflammatory change on the CT scan ().
The patient underwent laparoscopy in view of the CT scan findings. Laparoscopy identified a large phlegmon compressing on the distal ileum causing obstruction with distended proximal and collapsed distal small bowel loops (). Dissection of the phlegmon revealed a small abscess cavity and the unretrieved gallstone at its center (). The abscess was drained and the gallstone retrieved (), which resulted in a resolution of the small bowel obstruction. The patient made a gradual recovery and was subsequently discharged on postoperative day 4, at which point he was tolerating solid diet with return of normal gastrointestinal function.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 75-year-old woman presented with a ten-day history of decreased visual acuity in her right eye. Her past medical history included diabetes mellitus for the last five years.
Her visual acuity was hand motion in the right eye and 0.9 in the left eye. IOPs were 14 mmHg in the right eye and 12 mmHg in the left eye by Goldmann applanation tonometry. There was no anterior chamber reaction or NVI in the right eye. The right fundus showed a CRAO characterized by retinal opacification of the posterior pole with a cherry red spot. No clinical evidence of diabetic retinopathy was present in either eye. Fluorescein angiography showed sluggish retinal arterial flow and delayed retinal venous filling. Noninvasive carotid examination showed no evidence of obstruction.
Two weeks later, the patient returned for a follow-up examination. Her visual acuity in the right eye remained hand motion. However, the right eye now exhibited NVI and had an IOP of 40 mmHg. The retinal opacification was still present. After obtaining informed consent, bevacizumab (0.75 mg/0.03 ml) was injected. One week after the injection, the NVI had regressed, and the IOP had decreased to 22 mmHg with two topical antiglaucoma medications (dorzolamide/timolol fixed combination and brimonidine). PRP was performed in the right eye two weeks after the injection. The patient received 1600 burns over four sessions. Four months after combination therapy, the visual acuity remained hand motion with no recurrent neovascularization. The IOP was 17 mmHg with one topical antiglaucoma medication (dorzolamide/timolol fixed combination).","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 42-year-old man with no past significant medical illness presented with headache. CT scan done showed subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) predominantly in the perimesencephalic cisterns []. Magnetic resonance imaging T1 gradient sequence also showed the hypointense signal suggestive of blood products in the perimesencephalic cisterns []. Fetal posterior cerebral arteries are seen on both the sides arising from the internal carotid artery [Figures and ]. DSA (digital subtraction angiogram) done subsequently revealed fusiform bulbous dilation involving both the cisternal and cortical segments of the left SCA []. Endovascular treatment in the form of parent artery occlusion was done under general anesthesia, with complete exclusion of the aneurysm from the circulation as seen on post-coiling angiogram []. Standard heparin protocol was followed and activated clotting time greater than 250 s was maintained during the procedure. Six-French (6F) Envoy (cordis) guiding catheter was placed in the distal vertebral artery. A combination of echelon-10 microcatheter (ev3) and transcend 0.014 microwire (Stryker) were used to access the aneurysms. Multiple Axium (ev3) coils were used to occlude the aneurysm. There were no intra- and periprocedural complications and patient was discharged on the 5th day after operation. The post-operative course was uneventful. The patient's neurological examination after 1 month was completely normal.

"A 51-year-old cirrhotic man presented with abdominal pain for one day. He then had a sudden upper gastrointestinal bleeding and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated that a ruptured SAA located near to splenic hilum and formation of hematoma in left epigastric region (). Further ultrasonography confirmed liver cirrhosis and ascites. He underwent an urgent laparotomy. After dissection of severely adhered tissues, a pulsatile mass approximate 4.8 cm×5.6 cm×4.9 cm was found closely adhensive to stomach and splenic hilum. SAA resection, splenectomy, gastric suture and conventional splenorenal shunt were performed thereafter and the recovery was uneventful.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 22-year-old male presented to our clinic with recurrent episodes of hemoptysis over a 4-week period with 3 distinct events. He stated that this started with an incidence of heavy coughing. He then would cough up to 2–4 tablespoons of blood. After presentation to the emergency room, it was initially thought this was related to epistaxis, and he was sent home with treatment for allergic rhinitis. He had no other symptoms, denying fever, weight loss or gain, chest pain, easy bruising, dyspnea, or rash. He did complain of chronic postnasal drip, nasal congestion, and occasional pruritis, which he attributed to allergies. He had a past medical history of eosinophilic colitis, obsessive-compulsive disorder, history of an aneurismal bone cyst status post-removal, and allergic rhinitis. He had also been recently diagnosed with hypogonadism over the last 5 months, and was on injectable testosterone supplementation. He denied smoking, alcohol, and illicit drug use and had no known inhalant exposures and trauma to the airway that he could recall. His family history included a brother with eosinophilic colitis and his mother had vascular ectasias of her spinal cord. He did note that these episodes seemed to occur 5 days after his dose of intramuscular testosterone. Physical exam was otherwise unremarkable and laboratory values were unrevealing. Computed tomography did not reveal any notable lesion of the upper airway or lung parenchyma.
Upon flexible bronchoscopic evaluation, the following lesion was seen in the distal trachea (). The purple, vascular lesion was approximately 1–1.5 cm in size located 3 cm from the carina at the 5 o'clock position along the posterior wall attached by a short pedicle. A biopsy was taken at that time which only showed fibrin products and inflammatory cells. Hemostasis was difficult to obtain without use of cold saline, several injections of topical epinephrine and Argon Plasma Coagulation. Due to unavailability of pathology and the location of the lesion, the patient was taken to the operating suite where a therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was used with utilized. The lesion was obtained by electrocautery loop snare and endoscopic basket. The pathology revealed the diagnosis of lobular capillary hemangioma (Figures and ). The superficial portions of the lesion had undergone secondary, nonspecific changes including stromal edema, capillary dilation, inflammation, and a granulation tissue reaction. It demonstrated diagnostic, lobular arrangements of capillaries at its base, which consisted of discrete clusters of endothelial cells. The cellular architecture was made up of an inflammatory infiltrate of neutrophils and monocytes.
Upon followup, the patient had no hemoptysis episodes and has subsequently stopped his testosterone therapy.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 20-year-old Hispanic male with no past medical history presented to our institution complaining of generalized weakness for 4 weeks, progressive cough with yellowish sputum, as well as persistent shortness of breath for 3 weeks, and intermittent fever and chills for 3–5 days prior to admission. Family history was remarkable only for coronary artery disease in his father. He denied smoking, alcohol, and using illegal drugs. He had lived with his girlfriend for 2 years and stated to be monogamous over this period. He reported a total of two sexual partners in his life. He was born in Texas and had not traveled outside the US for the last 12 years. Physical examination revealed a cachectic and tachypneic patient in no acute distress with bilateral diffuse crackles and rhonchi. The initial laboratory workup was within normal limits. Computed tomography of the chest () showed diffuse tree-in-bud nodularity, bronchiectasis, and thick-walled cavities in the upper lobes and moderate right simple pleural effusion. The HIV-rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test was reactive. The acid-fast bacilli sputum test was positive, and the patient was started on combination treatment for tuberculosis. The patient improved clinically over the next 3 days. The HIV Western blot test was negative; the viral load was undetectable. The CD4+ and CD8 counts were low (124 and 185, respectively) with a low CD4:CD8 ratio of 0.7. Further workup including immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin G, and immunoglobulin M levels, urine protein electrophoresis, and serum protein electrophoresis was unremarkable. The pleural fluid cytology revealed atypical lymphocytes consistent with the established diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. Further imaging of the abdomen and pelvis showed no abnormalities.
In addition, 8 weeks after discharge the patient was seen in clinic. He was taking his medication to treat tuberculosis and had regular health care follow-up. He was found to be completely asymptomatic with a CD4+ count of 188 cells/mm3. The repeated HIV test was negative, and the viral load was undetectable. After finishing his treatment for tuberculosis, he was evaluated in clinic, had a CD4+ count of 212 cells/mm3, and remained asymptomatic.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 39-year-old woman, known case of oesophageal carcinoma, was scheduled for TTE with extended two-field lymphadenectomy with gastric pull-up with cervical neck oesophago-gastric anastomosis and feeding jejunostomy. She had history of hypertension since 4 years and controlled on amlodipine (10 mg) and atenolol (50 mg). She had also received pre-operative radiotherapy. The anaesthetic management and monitoring were as per institutional protocol and was administered epidural and general anaesthesia. As a part of operative procedure, right intercostal drain (ICD) and corrugated neck drain were placed. The intraoperative period was uneventful. She was shifted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for post-operative monitoring and analgesia. Three hours later, she developed respiratory distress and air leak through right ICD. Her oxygen saturation decreased from 97% to 84% over ½ h in spite of oxygen supplementation with Hudson mask. On auscultation, air entry was decreased on the right side and the percussion note was tympanic. She was put on oxygen at 15 L/min through Venturi mask (FiO2 0.60). Subsequent chest radiograph revealed right pneumothorax despite ICD being in situ. Another ICD tube was inserted in the right thorax to relieve pneumothorax. The respiratory distress was only partially relieved and the air leak from the ICD continued. Due to on-going respiratory distress, the patient's trachea was intubated. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy was done to rule out airway injury that was also normal. Hence, we suspected air leak from the cervical drain and it was decided to remove the cervical drain and suture the defect. After removal of the cervical drain, the air leak stopped. Chest X-ray showed inflated lungs and patient had symptomatic improvement. The patient was subsequently extubated and shifted to the ward.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 65-year-old woman with a history of hyperlipidemia had experienced headache and vomiting for 10 days before admission to another hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed enlargement of both lateral ventricles and a mass at the foramen of Monro. The patient was then referred to our hospital.
Neurological examination on admission to our hospital showed memory disturbance (Mini-Mental State Examination 20/30) and a wide-based gait disturbance. Computed tomography (CT) showed a 16 mm mildly hyperdense mass with no calcification at the foramen of Monro, and the mass was causing obstructive hydrocephalus. MRI revealed a well-delineated mass at the foramen of Monro with heterogeneous signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images; the mixed-signal core appeared as a popcorn-like lesion typical of cavernous angioma (Fig. ). Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted imaging revealed mild enhancement of the mass (Fig. ). There were no vascular abnormalities on CT angiography or CT venography. We considered a colloid cyst, central neurocytoma, subependymoma, ependymoma, low grade astrocytoma, and arteriovenous malformation as differential diagnosis; however, despite the unusual location of the mass, a diagnosis of intraventricular cavernous angioma was made because of its typical appearance on MRI.
We performed endoscope-assisted transcortical removal of the mass (Fig. ). The entry point was made using the StealthStation S7 navigation system (Medtronic Inc., Louisville, CO), and a flexible videoscope (VEF-V, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted. Intraoperative neuroendoscopic imaging revealed a reddish lobular mass with a hematoma and obstruction of the foramen of Monro. We observed the cavum septum pellucidum because of the high intracranial pressure associated with hydrocephalus. After right frontal mini-craniotomy, the Viewsite Brain Access System (Vycor Medical Inc., Boca Raton, FL) was inserted (Raza et al. ); we used the 17 mm wide retractor in the 7 cm length. Endoscope-assisted surgery with the Viewsite was performed with technique similar to microsurgery. A 2.7 mm rigid endoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) fixed by UniArm (Mitaka Kohki, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted. The working ambience was air because of its advantages over fluid ambience especially when dealing with a relatively vascularized pathology. Other microsurgical instruments were used parallel to the endoscope. The endoscope served only as an optic apparatus. We used the Viewsite as an access port to enable dual instrumentation (endoscope and microsurgical instrumentation). The tumor was bluntly dissected from the ventricle wall, and total en bloc resection of the lesion was performed by one surgeon using the two-handed technique. Bleeding was well controlled with irrigation and bipolar coagulation.
The resected tumor was reddish and consisted mainly of clotted blood vessels and xanthochromic tissue. Histological examination revealed a cavernous angioma with evidence of large vascular spaces filled with an organized thrombus (Fig. ).
Postoperative MRI confirmed complete removal of the tumor, and a return to normal ventricular size (Fig. ). The patient’s symptoms resolved immediately, and there were no postoperative complications. She was discharged without any neurological deficit. No complications or neurological impairment were observed at the 1-year follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"We demonstrate this technique in a 72-year-old woman who was referred for evaluation of iron deficiency anemia. EGD was performed for evaluation and revealed a 3-cm × 3-cm flat polyp (Paris classification 0-IIa) in the second portion of the duodenum, sparing the ampulla. Capsule endoscopy and colonoscopy were subsequently performed and revealed no other polyps or etiology for anemia. The decision was made to proceed with EMR. The polyp was lifted using a mixture of 6% hetastarch and methylene blue. Complete piecemeal EMR was performed using snare cautery.
After resection, post-EMR defect margins were prophylactically treated with snare tip soft coagulation to help prevent recurrence., To reduce the risk of delayed AEs, closure of the EMR defect with endoscopic clips was attempted. Because of the large size of the resection bed, complete apposition of the 2 edges of the mucosal defect using standard endoscopic clips was not feasible. The decision was made to proceed with rubber band–assisted closure. As described, a small rubber band was attached to the first clip. The clip was then placed on the proximal edge of the lesion at the area of maximal width, fixing the rubber band in place. A second clip was used to grasp the rubber band and was then attached to the opposite edge of the defect, approximating both edges. This allowed for subsequent closure of the remaining mucosal defect by easily adding additional clips at the now approximated edges.
A total of 8 endoclips were used, achieving excellent closure. The patient was discharged home the same day. There were no AEs, including bleeding or delayed perforation. Final pathology revealed a tubulovillous adenoma with no high-grade dysplasia. Surveillance EGD 6 months later revealed no evidence of recurrent adenomatous tissue.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 29-year-old female in her second pregnancy, with a history of tetralogy of Fallot or ventricular septal defect with pulmonary atresia, had undergone 4 surgeries during her childhood, including a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt, patch repair of ventricular septal defect, and a right ventricle (RV) to pulmonary artery (PA) conduit. At 20 weeks’ gestation during her first pregnancy, she developed severe symptomatic stenosis of the RV to PA conduit with a Doppler gradient of 98 mmHg, thus requiring a 22-mm balloon dilatation and Genesis XD stent as a temporizing measure until definitive repair could be undertaken postpartum. However, she was lost to follow-up after delivery of her first child and did not undergo postpartum repair of her RV to PA conduit stenosis.
The patient presented to our clinic during her second pregnancy at 21 weeks of gestation. Thus far, her pregnancy had been uncomplicated and prenatal testing to date had found no abnormalities in fetal development. On presentation, she admitted to mild dyspnea on exertion at a distance of 20 yards. On examination, the patient was tachycardic and normotensive with normal oxygenation. She was euvolemic with hemoglobin of 13.5 g/dL and creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL. Echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60% to 65%, with mild right atrial (RA) dilatation, evidence of RV hypertrophy, and an estimated RV pressure of 82 mmHg. The PA conduit was severely stenosed, with a mean gradient of 52 mmHg and unrestricted pulmonic valve insufficiency. Our assessment determined her modified World Health Organization (WHO) pregnancy risk classification to be II-III (moderately increased risk of maternal mortality and moderate morbidity).
She was seen again in clinic at 34 weeks’ gestation. Her symptoms and repeat echocardiogram were unchanged from the previous visit. However, at 36.5 weeks’ gestation, 2-dimensional echocardiogram done in preparation for delivery identified severe conduit stenosis with a mean gradient of >75 mmHg, peak gradient of 98 mmHg with a peak velocity of 5 m/s, and unrestricted pulmonic valve insufficiency. The patient's RV pressures at the time also exceeded 71 mmHg. Despite the severe restenosis and unrestricted insufficiency of her PA conduit, her symptoms remained New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II. The plan was to admit the patient prior to cesarean section for assessment of heart failure and bilateral tubal ligation at 37 weeks’ gestation.
As planned, she was admitted at 37 weeks for delivery and was cared for by a multidisciplinary team involving obstetrics, ACHD specialists, heart failure specialists, obstetric anesthesia, maternal fetal medicine, and the neonatal intensive care unit.
The patient underwent a successful low transverse cesarean section and bilateral tubal ligation under epidural block with an estimated blood loss of 1,100 mL. Postdelivery echocardiogram showed normal LVEF of 55% to 60%, RA and RV dilatation with RV hypertrophy, and no change in RV pressure or valve gradient. The RV to PA conduit stenosis had decreased to a peak velocity of <4.8 m/s and a mean gradient of <56 mmHg with unrestricted insufficiency.

"A 78-year-old woman was referred to our clinic with bilateral hearing loss with sound distortion, tinnitus and auditory hypersensitivity, recurrent vertigo/dizziness induced by loud noises (Tullio phenomenon), and a diagnosis of bilateral SSCD at the temporal bone HRCT performed in the emergency room (Figures 2a–c).
Preoperative audiometry indicated severe mixed hearing loss in the right ear, with moderate conductive hearing impairment in the left ear (). A pure tone sound of 110 dB at 500 and 1,000 Hz in the right ear, and pneumatically increasing external auditory canal pressure induced dizziness without detectable nystagmus on video-oculographic (or Frenzel goggles) examination. Her tympanogram was bilaterally normal. A stapedial reflex could not be performed due to patient intolerance (dizziness). Mastoid vibration elicited dizziness without detectable nystagmus on video-oculographic (or Frenzel goggles) examination. A temporal bone 1.5-T MRI with 3D reconstruction performed two months before did not show the bilateral dehiscence (). Air conduction cervical VEMPs (cVEMPs) demonstrated a threshold of 85 dB HL on the right side and 100 dB HL on the left side. The cVEMPs were recorded from both ears using 500 Hz short tone-bursts (STBs). A video head impulse test for horizontal and vertical canals, including both dehiscent SSC, showed normal vestibulo-ocular reflex gain bilaterally ().
Possible surgical procedures (superior canal plugging or resurfacing either through a middle fossa approach or via a transmastoid route, or RW niche plugging) were discussed with the patient. Comorbid cardiopulmonary conditions represented major contraindications for general anesthesia, so the latter procedure was the only possible option to pursue.
Since the patient did not show bilaterally any benefit from an air conduction hearing aid but rather had deteriorating auditory and vestibular symptoms on the right, we decided to perform the surgical procedure in the right ear as it had worse vestibular and auditory symptoms, a poorer hearing threshold, and greatly altered HRCT and VEMPs findings.
With local-assisted anesthesia, we performed a transcanal approach with elevation of the tympanomeatal flap and preservation of the chorda tympani nerve with a minimally invasive retroauricular incision. Ossicular mobility and continuity were assessed, we excluded the stapedial fixation, and no cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak was observed during the surgical procedure. After identification and reshaping of the RW niche, a vibroplasty was performed paying particular attention to correctly plugging the round window and coupling it with the floating mass transducer (FMT) of the VSB (). We opted to couple the FMT with the RW because concomitant RW plugging was performed and from previous studies it seemed to provide a more stable coupling over time than incus (). No ossicular chain abnormalities or perilymphatic fistula were observed intraoperatively.
The plugging of the round window was achieved using cartilage and perichondrium (tragus). This autologous tissue also helped to seal off the FMT in the round window niche. Furthermore, VSB hearing outcomes were monitored with electrocochleography using a cotton-wick recording electrode placed on the hypotympanum () ().
The wire of the VSB was housed in a canal tunnel drilled up to the tympanic attic. Minimal drilling of the cortical temporal bone posterosuperior to the external auditory meatus was necessary to house the implant receiver and extra wire (). The ear canal tunnel was covered with autologous cartilage and external auditory meatus packing was performed.
This study received an exemption from the ethics committee of the University Hospital of Siena (Comitato Etico Regione Toscana, area vasta Sud Est–AOU Senese, Usl Toscana Sud Est) on 10/21/2019 for publication.
Surgery was uncomplicated, the patient did not complain of any post-operative vestibular symptoms. Sutures and external meatus packing were removed on the 10th postoperative day. At the 1-month follow-up, the patient underwent VSB activation and hearing and vestibular examination. She reported a significant improvement in auditory hypersensitivity and reduced sound distortion although tinnitus remained unchanged. No disabling vestibular symptoms were reported. Neither dizziness nor nystagmus could be observed in response to loud sounds or increased external ear pressure on the right side. The postoperative pure tone audiogram revealed a mild increase at 500, 1,000, and 2,000 Hz and a mild decrease at 250 and 4,000 Hz for bone conduction thresholds (). An improvement to moderate hearing loss in the VSB-aided hearing threshold was confirmed at 3 months (). The maximum speech recognition score of bysillabic words at 65 dB HL improved from 10% preoperatively to 70% at the last follow-up. The improvement of hearing and vestibular symptoms was confirmed subjectively by the patient on the right side. Discomfort and mild dizziness associated with loud sounds on the left side remained unchanged. Using a visual analog scale (0–10), the patient reported an improvement in symptoms from 10 to 4 and from 9 to 2, respectively, for hearing and vestibular complaints (3-month follow-up). Left side mild symptoms related to dehiscence remained unchanged. No short-term surgical complications such as device extrusion or external or middle ear canal infection/inflammation were identified at the 3-month follow-up (). Control HRCT was not performed since correct positioning of the FMT and plugging of the RW were confirmed by improvements in symptoms and stability of VSB-aided hearing. Air conduction VEMPs were not performed for safety reasons due to the risk of mobilizing the plugging or FMT from the RW.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 45-year-old man, farmer by occupation, presented clinically with a slow growing, slightly tender, firm mass on the plantar aspect of left foot for 3 years, measuring 5×4×3 cm. There were multiple discharging sinuses covered with blood mixed purulent exudates. Radiograph showed features of osteomyelitis and soft tissue shadow. A tentative clinical diagnosis of tuberculous osteomyelitis was proposed. Imprint smears were made from the discharge and fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was done using a 23-gauge needle, attached to a 10-ml syringe. Aspirate consisted of sero-sanguinous, pus like material. Alcohol fixed smears were stained with Papanicolaou (Pap stain), while air-dried smears were stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa (MGG) stain. Simultaneously, Periodic acid Schiff (PAS), Gram’s stain and acid fast bacilli (AFB) stains were performed. Additionally, fungal and bacterial cultures were carried out.
Both FNAC smears and imprint smears comprised plenty of pus cells, some lymphocytes, histiocytes and foreign body giant cells in a necrotic background. Several brown to black colonies were seen. On higher magnification, these consisted of septate, branching fungal hyphae embedded in a cement-like matrix [Figures and ]. PAS stain highlighted the branching hyphae []. AFB and Gram’s stains were negative. The cytological diagnosis of eumycotic mycetoma was rendered with suggestion of Madura foot. The excised surgical specimen confirmed the diagnosis of eumycetoma. The fungal species was identified as Madurella mycetomatis on subsequent fungal culture.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"The first patient was a 45-year-old woman who presented with abdominal pain, weight loss, and diarrhea. She underwent a colonoscopy in October 2014, which revealed a 3-cm tumor in her cecum. A right colectomy was performed in January 2015, and a well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma of 2.5 × 1.5 × 1.5 cm invading into the muscularis propria was identified. No perineural or lymphovascular invasion was observed, but a mild tumor inflammatory infiltrate was present. Margins were free, and metastasis to one of 24 lymph nodes was documented. Ileal schistosomiasis was found in the specimen. MSI was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (loss of MLH1 and PMS2). All RAS mutations were negative. She received 6-month adjuvant capecitabine- and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.

"A 36-year-old African American male diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome positive CML two years ago presented to the emergency room for the second time with a history of a one-month progressively worsening weakness involving his left upper extremity, along with numbness and severe pain. His symptoms during the previous hospital evaluation were attributed to musculoskeletal causes after stroke was ruled out. Although he was unsure, he was reported by family members to have developed some facial asymmetry during this time. He had been noncompliant with his treatment with dasatinib, being irregular and casual in his approach to prescribed medication intake, and his primary oncologist was concerned with CML progression at an accelerated phase after having undergone a bone marrow biopsy. He was meanwhile awaiting the results of a recent cervical lymph node biopsy.
On neurological examination the patient was noticed to have left-sided ptosis, miosis, enophthalmos (), and reported facial anhidrosis on the left side, alongside ipsilateral weakness predominantly involving his intrinsic hand muscles, long finger flexors, and numbness involving the medial border of his arm, hand, and little finger (see Video 1 in Supplementary Material available online at ). The rest of his motor power was 5/5 throughout, with restriction of an accurate evaluation of his left upper extremity, due to exquisite pain-limited range-of-motion of the whole limb. Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ throughout. Plantar reflexes were down going bilaterally and no sensory level was appreciated. His findings were concerning for left Horner's syndrome and lower trunk brachial plexopathy, while the rest of his general physical examination was significant for scattered, nontender cervical lymphadenopathy.
His blood count revealed marked leukocytosis with a total leukocyte count of 102 × 109/L, predominated by myeloid precursors, 4% promyelocytes, 3% myelocytes, and 12% metamyelocytes. An electrodiagnostic study was deferred due to lack of patient cooperation from the pain. An MRI of the cervical spine and brachial plexus with and without contrast was performed. This revealed the presence of a bulky left paraspinal soft tissue mass (), extending from the C6 to T3 level, measuring 3.9 × 6.8 × 7.8 cm, anteroposterior, transverse, and cephalocaudad dimensions, respectively. This also involved the left C6 to T1 nerve roots and extended into the supraclavicular and retroclavicular segment of the left brachial plexus over approximately 6.8 cm in length, most consistent with leukemic infiltration. Extension into the spinal canal on the left was noted from C6/7 to the bottom of the T1 level without cord compression, along with abnormal bone marrow signal intensity involving the posteromedial first rib and left anterior scalene muscle, all again consistent with leukemic infiltration. Extensive lymphadenopathy was noted on imaging studies (), particularly involving the submandibular, left, and right internal jugular lymph nodes. The excisional biopsy of right cervical lymph node, meanwhile, confirmed myeloid sarcoma or chloroma with immunophenotyping revealing 32% blasts displaying myeloid-associated antigen expression and aberrant expression of CD5, CD7, and CD 117 (). In view of the collateral histological findings, his neurological presentation was attributed to a paraspinal chloroma with regional leukemic infiltration of the left lower brachial plexus, and a final diagnosis of CML with extramedullary myeloid blast crisis was made. He was started on aggressive induction chemotherapy with a 7 + 3 regimen (7 days of cytarabine at 100 mg/m2 plus 3 days of idarubicin at 12 mg/m2) in addition to resuming dasatinib. He was also initiated on radiotherapy of 10 fractionations to a total of 3000 centigray (cGy) for the paraspinal chloroma. Bone marrow biopsy on Day 14 was hypocellular with no blasts identified or evidence of residual leukemia. Repeat Computed Tomography of soft tissue neck showed interval decrease in size of his cervical lymphadenopathies and paraspinal soft tissue mass. His postchemotherapy, inhospital course was complicated with neutropenic fever, clostridium difficile diarrhea, and multifocal pneumonia with pleural effusion from which he gradually recovered. At the time of hospital discharge, his neurological deficits continued to persist. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and prophylactic intrathecal liposomal cytarabine (given his high risk for CNS involvement) were discussed as part of the postremission treatment plan.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 55-year-old man accidentally inhaled a chlorine cloud when cleaning the swimming
pool at his home, evolving to a clinical picture of mild dyspnea, cough with mucoid
sputum, and epigastric pain. He sought emergency care (after 30 minutes), where he
was initially evaluated for respiratory symptoms and received venous hydration,
bronchodilators, and oxygen therapy. However, he presented progressive clinical
worsening over a 3-hour period, with increased expectoration, arterial oxygen
saturation (SpO2) (from 95% to 60%), and cyanosis and was referred to the
reference emergency room, where he was seen in the emergency department. At that
time, he already had signs of acute respiratory failure, associated with intense
burning chest pain and cough with blood-tinged sputum. There was no history of
smoking, respiratory diseases, and other comorbidities.
At admission, the patient was afebrile, tachycardic (heart rate 110bpm), and
tachypneic (respiratory rate 34bpm), with a blood pressure of 134/82mmHg and an
SpO2 of 86% during oxygen macronebulization at 10L/minute. Chest
expandability was decreased due to pain, and respiratory auscultation detected the
presence of generalized decreased vesicular murmur and crackling rales mainly on the
lung bases. No other changes were detected on physical examination. Noninvasive
ventilation with 60% FiO2, 7cmH2O support pressure (SP), and
10cmH2O positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was started.
Arterial blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.41, a partial carbon dioxide pressure
(PaCO2) of 39.1mmHg, a partial oxygen pressure (PaO2) of
59.5mmHg, an oxygen saturation (SO2) of 87.4%, a bicarbonate level of
29mEq/L and a base excess of +0.7mmol/L. The patient had leukocytosis (leukocyte
count of 27,840 thousand/mm3 with 94% segmented). Electrolytes,
coagulation tests, and liver and canalicular enzymes were normal. Chest X-ray
revealed bilateral alveolar infiltrate in the lower third (). Chest tomography showed consolidation in the
posterior region of the lower lobes and discrete in the upper lobes, associated with
areas of diffuse ground-glass opacity in the upper lobes, in addition to an increase
in the diameter of the pulmonary arterial trunk (3.8cm), indicating hypertension of
the same ().
In the intensive care unit, antibiotic therapy with cefepime (2g every 8 hours),
intravenous corticosteroid (methylprednisolone 125mg every 6 hours), and
nebulization with a beta-agonist and an anticholinergic were started, with
progressive clinical improvement and noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV)
maintained intermittently for 4 days. A Dixtal® 3010 mechanical
ventilator with a full face mask interface was used in SP mode, using SP for a
target tidal volume of approximately 6 to 8mL/kg predicted weight and a PEEP ranging
from 5 to 10cmH2O, in addition to an FiO2 required to maintain
an oxygen saturation above 88%. On the first day, the patient remained on a zero
diet and remained on NIV for 24 hours; the PaO2/FiO2 ratio was
99. On the second day, pauses were taken for oral feeding; the
PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 150. On the third day, most NIV shifts
were maintained but with larger pauses; the PaO2/FiO2 ratio
was 230. On the fourth day, NIV was performed intermittently; the
PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 350. On the fifth day, the patient was
kept on oxygen macronebulization. On the sixth day and following until hospital
discharge, which occurred on the seventh day, the patient was spontaneously
ventilated with room air. He remained hemodynamically stable throughout his hospital
stay, without organ dysfunctions. He was discharged on the seventh day of
hospitalization and was given an oral corticosteroid and a bronchodilator. In his
outpatient follow-up, he underwent a chest X-ray, showing dense striae in the right
upper lobe (), with no other
alterations. Spirometry was also performed but did not show alterations.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 50-year-old man with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) evolved to end-stage renal failure and hemodialysis was started in 1992. Because of voluminous kidneys, a right nephrectomy was performed in 1992, followed by the left one in 1994. In April 1998, a deceased donor kidney transplantation was performed in the right iliac fossa. Induction therapy consisted in seven days of polyclonal anti-T-cell globulin (thymoglobulin), because of delayed graft function. Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine (CsA) and prednisone. Steroids were withdrawn in December 1998. No acute rejection was observed. At one month, the serum creatinine was 130 μmol/L and the glomerular filtration rate was estimated at 61 mL/min/1.73 m2 by MDRD. The serum creatinine remained stable during the followup and was of 113 μmol/L in March 2011.
During the followup in our outpatient clinic, the patient suffered from recurrent episodes of hepatic cyst infections, treated by antibiotics. In April 2007, bloating and abdominal discomfort developed. An abdominal MRI was performed showing a marked hepatomegaly with incomplete chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome, due to extrinsic venous compression by voluminous liver cysts. Because of worsening symptoms and many hepatic cyst infections, a new MRI was performed in June 2008, showing an increasing liver volume without progression of the Budd-Chiari syndrome. The liver volume was 3517 mL at this time. Because of preliminary data suggesting a potential benefit of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors therapy on hepatic cyst growth, CsA was stopped and sirolimus started at 0.5 mg/d to achieve serum levels between 4 and 6 ug/L (). MRIs were performed during the mTOR therapy because of worsening symptoms, and a followup was made with volumetric hepatic MRI. Only total hepatic volume was measured. Six months later, a new MRI showed a continuing increase in liver volume, which was estimated at 3883 mL. In November 2009, the liver volume was 4240 mL and in June 2010, 4400 mL (). The chronic partial Budd-Chiari syndrome did not change.
Under sirolimus therapy, our patient did not report adverse events like cutaneous rash, diarrhea, and aphthous stomatitis, but he developed important legs edema. Hyperlipidemia was controlled with pravastatin and there was no significant proteinuria. Because of the continuing increase in liver volume (i.e., no significant effect of sirolimus) and the important discomfort due to bilateral legs edema, sirolimus was stopped and CsA restarted in June 2010. The differential diagnosis of leg edema was venous compression due to hepatomegaly. After restarting CsA therapy, the leg edema resolved, which was consistent with a sirolimus side effect. Fifteen months after sirolimus was stopped, a new MRI was done. The liver volume was at 4700 mL (). The average hepatic growth over the two years of sirolimus therapy was of 37.5 mL per month versus 20 mL per month with cyclosporine.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 23-year-old male presented with complaint of cough with purulent expectoration, breathlessness on exertion, history of wheezing sound coming from chest, and low-grade fever of 3 weeks' duration. There was no previous history of such episodes or any other significant illness in the past. On admission, his vital signs were: Pulse rate 62 beats/min, blood pressure 128/72 mmHg, respiratory rate 24 breaths/min, and body temperature 36.5°C. Systemic examination showed bilateral expiratory wheeze on lung field auscultation. Routine laboratory tests revealed eosinophilia (57.5%) with absolute eosinophil count (AEC) of 7180/cu mm. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 10 mm fall in the first hour. A sputum smear for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and protozoa was negative. Sputum culture did not grow any organism. Peripheral blood smear showed no evidence of microfilarial parasite. Viral markers including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), and hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV) test were negative. Chest X-ray [] and noncontrast computed tomography (CT) of chest were normal. Spirometry was normal. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were done for evaluation of eosinophilia with respiratory symptoms. Bronchoscopy showed congestion of the left lower bronchus with mucoid secretion. Microscopic examination of wet mount of BAL revealed actively motile flagellates with polar tuft of flagella lashing rhythmically [], identified as L. blattarum [Figures and ]. Oral metronidazole 400 mg thrice daily was given for 2 weeks.

"A 37-years-old primigravida at 40 weeks gestation was brought to our hospital by ambulance following collapse at home. No obstetric notes were brought in. On admission she was anxious, apyrexial, dyspnoeic, and distressed.
On clinical examination she was hypoxic, with oxygen saturation of 68% on air and respiratory rate of 30/minutes. Blood pressure was 150/90, and Glascow coma scale was 11/15. There were no signs of labour. Soon after arrival she had a seizure. Following the seizure there was an episode of fetal bradycardia and an urgent caesarean section was performed under GA. The baby was delivered in good condition. There was no evidence of placental abruption or any other cause for fetal bardycardia. Patient's vitals were stable during the caesarean section. She was transferred to Intensive Care Unit, where she was intubated and ventilated. A CT chest showed extensive bilateral pnenumothoarces of greater than 70% in the left side and extensive opacities in the semicollapsed right lower lobe (see Figures and ). The CT head was normal. A left-sided chest drain was inserted on the same day. This was removed on the following day after patient's clinical condition had improved. Patient has no symptoms or signs which suggestive of Pre-eclamsia.
Following the caesarean section the family arrived. At this stage we found that the patient had longstanding right pleural endometriosis with multiple pneumothoraces and hydrothoraces and underwent right-sided pleurodesis in 2003. This lady was booked in at tertiary hospital for pregnancy care. She had regular followups with a Chest physician and Obstetrician. At 29 weeks gestation the patient had presented with mild dyspneoa and the chest X-ray revealed a small effusion but no significant pneumothorax. The cardiothoracic surgeon suggested that since the pleura was well stuck down, there was a low risk for expanding pnuemothorax. This patient still presented with severe hypoxia with pneumothorax. The Cardiothoracic surgeon further advised assistance with instrumental delivery as small risk of increased pneumothorax in the second stage of labour during pushing. Epidural or spinal anaesthesia was recommended and to avoid General anaesthesia. If general anaesthesia was needed then intermittent positive pressure ventilation should be used. The Obstetrician had planned for induction of labour at 41 weeks gestation. On the 4th day of postcaesarian section, the patient again complained of shortness of breath. On general examination the patient was dyspneic and tachypneic. Her blood pressure was normal, she had no proteinuria, and her liver function and platelets were within normal limits.
Chest X-ray showed that she had left-sided lower lobe pneumonia and was started on intravenous tazocin, IV gentamicin, and then on oral erythromycin. Patient recovered well and was transferred to a tertiary hospital.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"We evaluated a 4 years old girl, previously healthy, with no relevant family medical history. She was conducted to our clinic because of a submandibular lymphadenitis. A month before, during a 3 days fever period, a painful submandibular swelling was noted. Neck ultrasound (US) showed a 2-cm diameter lymphadenopathy with a conserved structure. Therapy with ibuprofen was then suggested. Because of symptoms persistence, a control US was repeated after 5 days. The lymph node was enlarged and presented a subverted structure, with hypoechogenic areas and an absent roundness index (Fig. ). Therapy with co-amoxiclav was immediately started at a dosage of 80 mg/kg/day for 6 days. Blood tests showed a slight increase in C-reactive protein values (53 mg/L; normal value <50 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (31 mm/h); serology for Cytomegalovirus confirmed a previous infection, while IgM for Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) were positive. Blood smear was normal. Tuberculin skin test resulted positive (10 mm infiltration diameter). QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-tube test and chest X-ray resulted negative.
Neck US performed after 20 days was unchanged. Therefore the girl was referred to our infectious disease unit for further investigations. At physical examination, a fixed right submandibular lymphadenopathy, with an elastic consistency, painless and with no superficial skin alterations was detected. No other significant clinical features were described. Blood tests showed no alteration in blood count, inflammatory markers, liver function, lactic dehydrogenase, coagulation. Francisella tularensis and Toxoplasma gondii serology were negative. EBV serology showed evidence of a past infection.
In the suspicion of an NTM lymphadenitis, antimicrobial therapy with clarithromycin (15 mg/kg/die), and rifampicin (20 mg/kg per day) was started. A magnetic resonance imaging showed a confluent lymphonodal pack inside the inferior pole of the right parotid gland (4 × 4.2 × 2.9 cm) that was enhanced after contrast medium infusion. The enhancement involved also the whole parotid gland parenchyma and the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid muscle.
Due to sudden enlargement of swelling, exeresis of the lymph node was performed. Bacterioscopic exam showed a positivity for acid-fast bacilli, and the histological examination evidenced a granulomatous inflammation. Culture from the biopsy grew a M. marseillense strain, identified using a commercial kit (Hain Genotype Mycobacteria CM, Hain Lifescience, Germany) and sequencing the spacer region interposed between 16S and 23S rRNA genes, as described previously []. Because of a slow healing up of the surgical scar, ethambutol (25 mg/kg/die) was added to the previous therapy. Antimicrobial treatment was well tolerated by the patient and no adverse effect were reported. Blood exams and clinical assessment were periodically performed in order to evaluate potential drug-induced toxicity. Therapy was finally stopped 2 months after surgery.
Periodical blood tests and neck US were performed. At 10 months follow up visit, no relapse was found and the surgical scar was completely healed.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"Our patient was a 44-year-old woman who underwent proximal gastrectomy and bilateral truncal vagotomy for a gastric neuroendocrine tumor. Her immediate postoperative course was uneventful, and no surgical complications, such as anastomotic fistula, were observed. On the third postoperative day, she presented with abdominal discomfort and bloating, nausea and vomiting (Figure ). On the fourth postoperative day, the patient developed severe, watery diarrhea. Her blood pressure suddenly decreased to 60/38 mmHg for unknown reason. An examination revealed that her body temperature was 37.2°C, her pulse was increased at 126 beats/minute, her respiratory rate was 28 breaths/minute and her blood oxygen saturation was 86%. A complete blood count was obtained, and the results revealed a white blood cell count of 2.9 × 109/L with 83% neutrophils and 13% lymphocytes. Analysis of blood gas showed that the patient’s blood lactate level was 8.2 mmol/L and base excess was −9.2. Serum level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was 143.4 mg/L. Blood and urine were collected for bacterial culture, and both test results were negative. The patient was urgently transferred to the ICU. On the fifth postoperative day, her temperature rose to 39.6°C and her pulse rate was 145 beats/minute, and she developed respiratory distress (Additional file ). Endotracheal intubation was performed to allow mechanical ventilation (Figure ). Her degree of diarrhea was aggravated, with a passage of greenish, watery liquid exceeding 1,800 ml. Her white blood cell count had increased to 7.9 × 109/L, and the proportion of neutrophils had risen to 98%. Her platelet count had decreased, and a coagulation test showed a prolonged time to coagulation. Sulbactam, ornidazole, vecuronium, norepinephrine, hydrocortisone and intensive intravenous fluids were administered, owing to concern about septic shock []. The patient was then treated with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) via percutaneous access and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). During the following days, the patient’s vital signs and clinical condition gradually stabilized. VV-ECMO and CRRT were stopped on the 12th postoperative day, but the patient’s diarrhea did not shown any improvement. On the next day, her fever reoccurred, with a peak temperature of 38.7°C (Additional file ). Her white blood cell count rose further to 18.0 × 109/L with 89% neutrophils and 10% lymphocytes. Her blood cultures now yielded Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterococcus faecalis, revealing a polymicrobial sepsis. Multiple antibiotics, including imipenem, caspofungin, penicillin and/or linezolid, and even probiotic bifidobacteria, were administered. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) was performed on days 15 and 22 postsurgery, and no intraabdominal free fluid or abscesses was noted (Additional file and Additional file ). The therapeutic strategies with antibiotics and probiotic were continued until 28 days, when the patient still had a fever (38.3°C) and the volume of watery stools reached 2,855 ml. On that day, the patient’s blood culture grew Propionibacterium acnes. Her white blood cell count returned to normal, but her CRP level remained as high as 103.3 mg/L. The timeline shown in Figure depicts the temporal course of our patient’s treatment.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 77-year-old man with severe aortic stenosis and persistent AFL was admitted for elective aortic valve replacement and concomitant surgical AFL ablation. Written informed consent for cardiac mapping (MEC-2015-274) was obtained prior to surgery.
Before induced cardiac arrest, a mapping array of 128 electrodes (interelectrode distance: 2 mm) was used to cover the epicardial atrial surface of Bachmann's bundle (BB), the right atrium (RA), anterior LA including the left atrial appendage (LAA), and pulmonary vein area. In addition, recordings of the endocardial right atrial septum were obtained.
U-EGMs, sampled at a frequency of 1000 Hz, were automatically analyzed offline and manually checked using customized software. Local activation times were defined as the steepest negative deflection of U-EGM potentials and used to reconstruct wavemaps during 10 seconds of AFL.
Subsequently, distribution of AFL cycle length (AFL-CL) and AFL-CL variability were assessed at all locations. Variability of AFL-CL is defined as standard deviation of the AFL-CL histogram.
In line with prior mapping studies, the proportion of lines of CB was calculated as the number of lines of CB (interelectrode conduction time > 11 ms) relative to the total number of interelectrode connections. A cut-off value of >11 ms was derived from prior mapping studies in which this degree of delay was associated with reversal of wavefront direction at the other side of the line of CB. Beat-to-beat consistency in patterns of activation was evaluated by comparing entry sites of the AFL wave and main direction of propagation in consecutive wavemaps for each location. Frequency of fractionated potentials, defined as electrogram potentials consisting of 2 or more negative deflections, were quantified as the number of fractionated potentials relative to the total number of potentials. As we previously demonstrated that fractionated unipolar potentials are caused by remote, asynchronous activation of the atrial wall,, , all deflections of fractionated potentials were annotated in a separate analysis to identify electrical asynchrony in deeper tissue layers.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year. Exclusion Criteria: Younger than 65 years old, having decompensated liver disease, psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance, having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy.",1
"A 65-year-old woman with a history of hyperlipidemia had experienced headache and vomiting for 10 days before admission to another hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed enlargement of both lateral ventricles and a mass at the foramen of Monro. The patient was then referred to our hospital.
Neurological examination on admission to our hospital showed memory disturbance (Mini-Mental State Examination 20/30) and a wide-based gait disturbance. Computed tomography (CT) showed a 16 mm mildly hyperdense mass with no calcification at the foramen of Monro, and the mass was causing obstructive hydrocephalus. MRI revealed a well-delineated mass at the foramen of Monro with heterogeneous signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images; the mixed-signal core appeared as a popcorn-like lesion typical of cavernous angioma (Fig. ). Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted imaging revealed mild enhancement of the mass (Fig. ). There were no vascular abnormalities on CT angiography or CT venography. We considered a colloid cyst, central neurocytoma, subependymoma, ependymoma, low grade astrocytoma, and arteriovenous malformation as differential diagnosis; however, despite the unusual location of the mass, a diagnosis of intraventricular cavernous angioma was made because of its typical appearance on MRI.
We performed endoscope-assisted transcortical removal of the mass (Fig. ). The entry point was made using the StealthStation S7 navigation system (Medtronic Inc., Louisville, CO), and a flexible videoscope (VEF-V, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted. Intraoperative neuroendoscopic imaging revealed a reddish lobular mass with a hematoma and obstruction of the foramen of Monro. We observed the cavum septum pellucidum because of the high intracranial pressure associated with hydrocephalus. After right frontal mini-craniotomy, the Viewsite Brain Access System (Vycor Medical Inc., Boca Raton, FL) was inserted (Raza et al. ); we used the 17 mm wide retractor in the 7 cm length. Endoscope-assisted surgery with the Viewsite was performed with technique similar to microsurgery. A 2.7 mm rigid endoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) fixed by UniArm (Mitaka Kohki, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted. The working ambience was air because of its advantages over fluid ambience especially when dealing with a relatively vascularized pathology. Other microsurgical instruments were used parallel to the endoscope. The endoscope served only as an optic apparatus. We used the Viewsite as an access port to enable dual instrumentation (endoscope and microsurgical instrumentation). The tumor was bluntly dissected from the ventricle wall, and total en bloc resection of the lesion was performed by one surgeon using the two-handed technique. Bleeding was well controlled with irrigation and bipolar coagulation.
The resected tumor was reddish and consisted mainly of clotted blood vessels and xanthochromic tissue. Histological examination revealed a cavernous angioma with evidence of large vascular spaces filled with an organized thrombus (Fig. ).
Postoperative MRI confirmed complete removal of the tumor, and a return to normal ventricular size (Fig. ). The patient’s symptoms resolved immediately, and there were no postoperative complications. She was discharged without any neurological deficit. No complications or neurological impairment were observed at the 1-year follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 46-year-old male with a history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis complicated by small esophageal varices after banding and moderate ascites was awaiting liver transplant (MELD 24, Child-Pugh class B). He presented with a 3-day history of abdominal pain. He described the pain as sharp and located around the periumbilical area with notable suprapubic discomfort. He also reported associated symptoms of nausea, hematochezia, and general malaise. On further review of systems, he reported chills, increased fatigue, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and decreased appetite 4 days prior to presentation. He reported compliance at home with a sodium-restricted diet and medications. Physical exam was significant for abdominal distension with positive fluid wave, generalized abdominal tenderness, and splenomegaly. Scant blood was noted on the rectal exam. Laboratory studies revealed stable hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL, hematocrit of 36.8%, platelet of 83 K/UL, leukocytosis of 15.4 K/UL with 78% neutrophils and 16% bands, sodium of 130 mmol/L, ammonia of 83 Umol/L, ALT of 40 U/L, AST of 42 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase of 127 U/L. International normalized ratio (INR) was 2.02. Diagnostic paracentesis revealed serosanguinous fluid and ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) count of 686 cells/mm3, consistent with culture negative neutrocytic ascites. Blood cultures revealed no growth of organisms. The patient was started on intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone, IV pantoprazole infusion, and an IV bolus of octreotide followed by continuous infusion. He completed a 5-day course of IV ceftriaxone therapy.
The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which showed ulcerations in the distal esophagus from prior banding of small esophageal varices and diffuse portal hypertensive gastropathy (). Mucosal edema and erythema with an area of oozing of blood were identified in the duodenum bulb and between proximally located duodenal folds with no specific identifiable lesion. These findings correlated with a diagnosis of portal hypertensive duodenopathy (). Colonoscopy was performed, and it showed no active bleeding. However, there were old blood clots in the terminal ileum in addition to mild inflammation in the terminal ileum near the ileocecal valve. Video capsule endoscopy was also performed, and it revealed no active bleeding. Because of the concern of the possible failure of the patient on medical therapy for portal hypertension while awaiting liver transplant, the patient was referred for evaluation by a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). The patient successfully underwent the TIPS procedure. Follow-up occurred one month later in clinic. At this time, the patient reported resolution of the hematochezia.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 54-year-old male reported to our department with history of swelling over the right side of face since 5 years. The patient reported insidious onset of swelling with a gradual progress to the present size. He also reported mild, intermittent, and dull pain in the region of swelling.
Clinical examination confirmed a solitary, oval, well-defined swelling measuring approximately 7 × 5 cm in the preauricular region []. The surface over the swelling was smooth without any secondary changes. It extended superioinferiorly from the level of outer canthus of the eye to inferior border of mandible and anterioposteriorly extended from 2 cm in front of anterior border of ramus to the mastoid notch []. On palpation, the swelling was firm, non-tender, free from skin, and mobile over the underlying structures. Mild pulsations could be appreciated from the swelling. There was no weakness of facial muscles or enlargement of swelling during mastication.
Ultrasonography revealed a large lobulated solid mass of 6 × 4 cm in the right parotid region with multiple vessels with low velocity flow and without any areas of calcification or cystic changes. Findings were suggestive of a low-grade vascular tumor.[] Computed tomography scan with contrast medium revealed a large well-circumscribed, solitary isodense lesion measuring 6.36 × 4.39 cm []. It was observed to be extending anteriorly over the superficial lobe of the parotid gland, with anterior displacement of parotid gland. A diagnosis of mixed parotid tumor was made.[] FNAC revealed numerous vascular channels with occasional singly scattered and single cluster of plump spindle cells. Based on these findings, a lesion of vascular origin was suggested.
Classical superficial parotidectomy was performed under general anesthesia using a modified Appiani incision. Tumor mass was dissected anteriorly and excised along with the superficial lobe of parotid gland []. Facial nerve was located using the anterograde method and all the branches of facial nerve were preserved. Post-operative recovery was uneventful. Upon six months of follow up, facial nerve function was intact and no sign of reoccurrence was observed.
Histopathological sections revealed connective tissue with numerous vascular spaces of variable sizes ranging from small capillary-like vessels to partly lined vessels. Around the endothelial cells, few vascular spaces showed a rim of circumscribed smooth muscle cells. The supporting connective tissue stroma appeared immature and fibromyxoid with sparse cellularity. Cells were plump or stellate-shaped with mild inflammatory cell response and composed predominantly of plasma cells and a few lymphoid follicles []. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong uptake of CD34 in the endothelial cells [].[] Findings were suggestive of a vascular lesion compatible with diagnosis of ENA.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 60-year-old woman presented with one year of worsening throat discomfort, intermittent cough, and dyspnea with exertion. She denied any hemoptysis, otalgia, or odynophagia. She had no other significant past medical or social history including no history of tobacco use.
A CT neck with contrast demonstrated a mass involving the anterolateral right subglottic larynx with extension along the upper cervical trachea ().
In-office flexible nasolaryngoscopy identified a fleshy pink-colored mass in the immediate right subglottis obstructing approximately 50% of the airway. She then underwent microdirect laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy for debulking and biopsy ().
Operative findings were notable for extension of the mass approximately 1 cm below the true vocal fold.
Pathologic analysis noted small B-cells positive for CD19, CD20, and PAX5 and negative for CD5, CD10, and cyclin D21. FISH was negative for the 18q21 MALT1 gene. The combination of these findings confirmed the diagnosis of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type was made.
A staging CT neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis scan was negative for metastatic disease. Following multidisciplinary tumor board review, she was recommended low-dose radiation at 24–30 Gy in 2 Gy daily fractions for approximately 3 weeks contingent upon review of a bone marrow biopsy. Bone marrow biopsy was negative, and radiation treatment was finalized as 30 Gy in 15 fractions over the course of 1 month. Treatment was completed by May 2018. Following radiation treatment, she reported mild dysphagia and dysgeusia which has improved. Her breathing has improved, and she has returned to her normal exercise tolerance. At 21-month follow-up, there was no evidence of disease on exam or imaging; however, she continues to report a mild cough intermittently with no issues with eating, drinking, or breathing.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"The case was of a 22-year-old woman complaining of headache for 18 months with severe episodes lasting around 6 hours, recurring about twice a month. Pain was located on the parietal regions, spreading to the orbit. Attacks were accompanied by nausea severe enough to hinder routine activities. The case was assessed by several specialists ruling out neurological, ophthalmological, and otorhinolaryngological pathologies. Cranial computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no pathology. Previous treatments considered nonsteroidal analgesics, physical therapy, hot and ice packs applications, and low-level laser therapy. All of them did not relieve pain to a satisfactory level. Her neurologist referred her to the orthodontic clinic suspecting a dilemma somewhere in her braces. The patient had fixed orthodontic appliance in the lower arch only with right first premolar extracted and space was closed with a satisfactory treatment outcome.
Clinical examination showed good oral hygiene with no signs of periodontal disease. Panoramic radiography (OPG) was normal. Occlusion was normal with no temporomandibular joint disorders. However, the patient reported that headache started 4 weeks after brackets bonding. At this stage, the patient was referred to a specialized center to test salivary biochemistry, particularly nickel and chromium levels. The chemical analyses were performed with a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer using unstimulated salivary sample.
After consultation with patient's neurologist, a decision was made to remove braces as soon as possible and provide her with a CAD/CAM zirconium bar as a bonded mandibular fixed retainer as the patient refused to wear any removable appliance. The treatment objectives were to (1) remove braces and retain teeth at their present position and (2) fabricate a bonded mandibular fixed retainer being biocompatible in attempt to relieve the patient's complaint.
Occlusal rests of 2 mm depth were prepared on the mesial surface of first premolars. Brackets were covered with wax prior to impression taking to facilitate its removal. A definitive impression of the mandibular teeth was made with an alginate impression material and the master model was prepared from type IV stone (ResinRock, Whip Mix Europe, Dortmund, Germany). The working cast was mounted on articulator and scanned in the S600 ARTI scanner (Ice Zirkon, Zirkonzahn-ZA9246A, Italy) to transfer the baseline landmarks from the mandibular arch directly to the software (). The CAD/CAM design included a 1.8 mm width and a 1.4 mm thickness zirconium bar extended on the lingual surface of lower teeth from canine to canine and at 3.5 mm away from the free gingival margin. Occlusal rests were connected to the bar as well (). The finished design was directly milled using Zirkonzahn's Screw-Tec system.
Zirconium does not chemically adhere to enamel; therefore, the inner surface of the milled bar facing teeth was reduced manually and placed under an infrared lamp to dry for 40 minutes and then sintered overnight at 1,600°C in a sintering furnace Zirkonofen 700. Later, a thin layer of feldspathic ceramic was fired onto the bar () and subsequently received the treatments sandblast, hydrofluoric acid etching, and silane coupling while the outer part was glazed (). The try of insertion of the entire bar into the patient's mouth proceeded properly ensuring good marginal fitness. The retainer was cemented with two dual-cured cement types (Variolink II and RelyX ARC). The occlusal rest on the left side needed minimal reduction ().
Salivary spectrophotometry analysis showed that nickel concentration was 4.230 μg/L and chromium was 12.520 μg/L. These concentrations were much lower than estimated toxic levels but comparable to the average dietary intake of nickel (200–300 μg/day) and chromium (280 μg/day) []. Several in vitro studies found that release reached a maximum within the first month of boding and then diminished due to formation of surface oxide film which resists corrosion, thus slowing down the release of metals []. However, the case is different here where measurable amounts of nickel and chromium release were recorded after 22 months of treatment alerting possible association with the complaint.
The patient reported pain relief two weeks following cementation, and headache subsided completely after 6 weeks. Another atomic absorption spectrometer analysis was performed to test salivary nickel and chromium levels which showed negligible concentrations which might explain the patient's complaint. The patient was reviewed regularly for two years reporting no complaint (). Clinical evaluation appeared to give good functional value where the marginal fit of digitized CAD/CAM design and glazed surface offered an enhanced approach of fixed retention.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"The patient was a 34-year-old African American US-born single female. At the time of the investigation she was unemployed and lived temporarily with her mother, who had a history of paranoid schizophrenia. The patient was brought to the psychiatry emergency room by ambulance for evaluation of aggression. Upon presentation, the patient described an altercation with her mother's landlady, hitting her numerous times in the face with a closed fist. The patient started the altercation because she felt that the landlady practiced voodoo and had cursed her, causing her hair to fall off. She described an overwhelming rage prior to the physical assault. The patient did not show any remorse for her actions: “I hate her,” “I did the right things,” and “She is evil” are examples of statements made by the patient. Collateral information from the patient's mother revealed that the patient had not been compliant with her medications. She refused to follow up with outpatient care after the last inpatient admission ten months previously. The patient denied auditory hallucinations but appeared to be internally preoccupied. She denied visual and tactile hallucinations, thought insertion, and thought broadcasting. She reported an unchanged pattern of sleep and appetite, which she described to be “good.” Prior to this episode, the patient had been under economic and emotional stress. She lost her job as a nurse aide five months earlier and had not been able to secure another job since then. The patient broke up with her fiancée ten months previously after cutting her fiancée's stepfather's face following verbal altercation. There was no symptom suggestive of mania, seizure disorder, head trauma, loss of consciousness, cerebrovascular accident, Parkinson's disease, anxiety, or other organic brain disorder. The patient denied use of nicotine, alcohol, and other psychoactive substances currently or in the past. The patient had her first inpatient psychiatry admission for acute exacerbation of paranoid schizophrenia and FAS ten months earlier. She was then treated with risperidone tablets with improvement including change in accent on discharge, when she was less psychotic. The patient had a family history of sickle cell disease (brother had sickle cell disease) and schizophrenia (brother, mother, and uncle had schizophrenia). Birth and developmental history were unremarkable. There were no reported behavioral or learning disabilities, and the patient denied being a victim of emotional, physical, or sexual abuse. She had some college education and worked as a nurse aide up till five months prior to presentation to the hospital.
Mental status examination showed a middle-aged, well-groomed, dark-haired woman with poor eye contact and in no apparent distress. The patient was tangential and preoccupied with “voodoo” and was deeply paranoid of her neighbors and her mother's landlady. Auditory hallucinations were not elicited, and she denied suicidal ideation at the time of evaluation. The patient continued to endorse homicidal ideation towards her mother's landlady. She was awake, alert, orientated in time, place, and person, and attentive and had good concentration but had poor impulse control. Her insight and judgment were impaired. Immediate recall and short- and long-term memory were intact.
The physical examination of the patient showed no significant pathological findings. Laboratory investigations were unremarkable. Electroencephalogram showed no seizure activity. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR angiography of the head were both unremarkable.
The patient presented with a British-like accent, despite never having lived in Britain, and was therefore investigated by a speech therapist. There was no phonetic problem or grammatical errors, but there was a problem with prosody, including prominence of the pitch of the words and syllables. The patient's pitch range was narrow, as she sparingly expressed any emotions during speech. Her speech was monotonous, hesitant, and of low volume. She substituted “th” for “f” and “w” for “wh” as well as “t” for “d” and “ai” for “ei.”
The patient was diagnosed according to DSM-V criteria with paranoid schizophrenia, chronic condition with acute exacerbation, and in addition FAS. The diagnosis of schizophrenia was made based on disorganized speech, specifically tangentiality, paranoid delusions, and grossly disorganized behavior, which lasted for more than ten months and affected the level of functioning, specifically with regard to interpersonal relations and occupation. This was determined not to be due to illicit drug use or known medical illness.
The patient was discharged from the previous hospitalization ten months earlier with a prescription of disintegrating tablets of risperidone. However, she was not compliant with this compound after discharge and also refused to take it during the second hospital admission described here. The patient agreed to take olanzapine tablets to address her psychosis. She was offered a readily dissolvable formula, as we had concern she was “checking” her medications to spit out after administration. However, the patient refused to take any other medication than conventional olanzapine tablets. The olanzapine serum concentration could not be controlled, because the patient became more delusional and refused further blood work. The patient continued to have psychotic symptoms and her foreign accent remained unchanged. She refused augmentation with any other antipsychotic medication because of paranoia. In the course of treatment, the patient continued to endorse homicidal ideation, paranoid ideation towards her mother's landlady, and still spoke in a British accent. In view of unremitting psychotic symptoms, she was transferred to a long-term psychiatric inpatient facility.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"This patient is an 11-year-old girl with a homozygous duplication spanning the promoter region to exon 6 of LDLR (c.-187-? 940+? Dup) []. Family history includes sudden death in an older brother aged 17. Another brother has HoFH with aortic stenosis and a non-critical obstruction of the right coronary artery. The patient presented with non-critical aortic stenosis/supra aortic stenosis, and non-obstructive plaques in the carotid arteries. Her computed tomography angiography showed no signs of coronary artery disease.
The patient commenced LLT at the age of 2 years when LDL-C levels were 1009 mg/dL. Up until the age of 7, she was treated with atorvastatin 40 mg/day and ezetimibe 10 mg/day and her LDL-C level was 453 mg/dL. LA is not available in the patient’s home country.
At age 7, atorvastatin dose was decreased to 10 mg/day, and lomitapide was commenced at a dose of 5 mg/day. Over the next year, lomitapide was escalated to 30 mg/dL but this dose was reduced back to 20 mg/day as a result of diarrhoea. LDL-C levels were effectively reduced with treatment (nadir 231 mg/dL; 40.7% reduction) with no elevations in LFTs (Fig. ). A trip to a remote region of Brazil led to brief discontinuation of lomitapide with a consequent increase in LDL-C levels. Following resolution of the issues, reintroduction of lomitapide resulted in the expected decrease in LDL-C levels.
The patient is now maintained on atorvastatin 60 mg/day, ezetimibe 10 mg/day and lomitapide 20 mg/day and has been treated with lomitapide for 4.5 years. She continues to develop normally and had her menarche at the age of 11 years. LDL-C levels are 266 mg/dL (38% reduction from pre-lomitapide values). A routine check-up revealed no calcification in the coronary arteries; however, there were signs of aortic stenosis and supra aortic stenosis, and some non-obstructive plaques in the carotid arteries, but these are not considered to be life-threatening. There were no elevations of liver enzymes during treatment. A detailed history of this patient has been published by Chacra et al.

"A 24-year-old unmarried female patient presented to us with a persistent fistula in the right iliac fossa following an appendicectomy done in another hospital 6 weeks previously. On further questioning, she informed us that she had presented to this hospital with a 2-week history of abdominal pain, confined to the right lower abdomen. She complained of general ill health and occasional altered bowel habits for 6 months prior to this acute episode.
An enquiry with the doctors who had initially seen her revealed that at the time of presentation for acute appendicitis she was quite unwell with fever, tachycardia, and dehydration. Her abdomen was tender all over with guarding, more pronounced over the right lower half. Her white cell count was 24 × 109/L. An X-ray of her abdomen showed a few fluid levels and an ultrasound scan revealed free fluid in the abdomen with an associated right iliac fossa mass.
A diagnosis of pelvic peritonitis secondary to acute appendicitis was made by the physicians, and she was taken up for surgery after adequate resuscitation. The abdomen was approached through a right McBurney's incision. There was pus in the abdomen with an appendicular mass, and the appendix appeared oedematous, thickened, and congested. An appendicectomy was carried out followed by a thorough irrigation of the abdominal cavity. The abdomen was closed after placing a drain, which was removed on the 3rd post-operative day. In spite of antibiotic administration, she developed a wound infection and persistent pyrexia. She was managed conservatively with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medication and eventually improved, except for a persistent purulent discharge from the wound. She then decided to seek our opinion and was admitted under our care for further investigation and management.
The appendicular histopathology was retrieved from the previous hospital and revealed transmural inflammation with granulomas suggestive of Crohn's disease. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen carried out in our hospital showed pericaecal collection with an inflammatory mass in front of the caecum ().
The abdomen was surgically explored through the previous incision after excising the fistula leading into the caecum. An inflammatory mass associated with the caecum was noted. The appendicular stump had not healed, and was draining into a cavity which was communicating with the wound, indicating a complex enterocutaneous fistula. A limited right hemicolectomy was carried out and continuity established with a primary anastomosis of macroscopically-appearing healthy bowel of the ascending colon and terminal ileum. A specimen of the resected caecum revealed the cobblestone appearance of the mucosa, strongly suggesting the possibility of underlying caecal Crohn's disease (). The histology was reported as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consistent with Crohn's disease (). The patient's post-operative recovery was uneventful. She was referred to a gastroenterologist and was being treated with mesasalazine and a regular annual colonoscopy. When last seen at two years post-surgery she continued to remain in good health.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 67-year-old female with NF1 presented with lumbago, cold sweats, and sudden onset weakness, which necessitated an emergency transfer to our institution. She had no significant past medical history, was negative for hypertension, and was on no regular medications. She was hypotensive (systolic blood pressure = 60 mmHg) and tachycardic on arrival. An abdominal contrast computed tomography (CT) scan showed a rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with communication between the aneurysm and the inferior vena cava (IVC) (Fig. a, b). The maximum dimensions of the ruptured AAA and IVC were 34 mm and 37 mm, respectively. The aortic rupture was located 7.5 cm distal to the renal artery and 2.5 cm proximal to the bifurcation of the aorta (Fig. c). Due to the difficulty of primarily closing the ruptured IVC, we planned an endovascular treatment to control the bleeding from the IVC by exclusion of the ruptured AAA. The diameter of normal proximal aorta was 16 mm, which was too narrow to place a normal Y-shaped graft. Moreover, there was insufficient time to prepare another stent in emergency. Therefore, we instead deployed an ENDURANTII (Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, CA, USA) iliac extension proximal to the terminal aorta that was long enough to insert three or more stents (Fig. d). As the bleeding from the AAA and the communication between the aneurysm and the IVC were not well controlled, we placed an EXCLUDER (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) cuff in the ENDURANTII iliac extension. Although a type IV endoleak was detected on angiography, the patient’s hemodynamics stabilized. We therefore decided to conclude the operation at this point and re-assess the endoleak in a few days.
An abdominal contrast CT performed 3 days after the operation showed a type Ib endoleak and injury to the distal abdominal aorta (Fig. a). This led to a redo-EVAR 4 days after operation. This included deploying an AFX (Endologix, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) graft, as well as an infrarenal cuff, as the AFX head did not fit exactly within the stent placed in the primary operation. We also performed coil embolization treatment of the left internal iliac artery aneurysm (Fig. b), which was identified initially (Fig. b). We confirmed no endoleak at the final angiography. An abdominal contrast CT performed 18 days after the primary operation showed two new sequential aneurysms of the LCA, which were not previously detected. Coil embolization was planned to address these new aneurysms.
Twenty-two days after primary operation, however, the patient presented with new onset nausea, left abdominal pain, and hypotension. Her systolic blood pressure was 50 mmHg. She was resuscitated and required vasopressor support. Laboratory tests, including leukocyte count and electrolytes, were normal. The serum C-reactive protein and D-dimer were elevated to 0.37 mg/dl (normal range 0.01–0.30) and 6.8 μg/ml (normal range 0.0–1.0), respectively. We considered potential bleeding from nearby arteries, including the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and lumbar artery [, ]. An abdominal contrast CT showed enlargement of LCA aneurysms and surrounding hematoma (Fig. a–c), establishing the diagnosis of rupture of the LCA aneurysms. Emergency exploratory surgery was performed.
We gained access through a midline abdominal incision. Active bleeding was encountered intraperitoneally and controlled with compression. As a result of the patient’s initial AAA rupture, residual hematoma was present, which extended along the entire left abdomen and retroperitoneum (Fig. a). In addition, the AAA stent endograft had resulted in a left laterally displaced aorta, narrowing our operative field. Due to her distorted anatomy, active bleeding, and clinical condition, we elected to perform a left hemicolectomy. We divided the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) 3 cm distal to the IMA root to not to injure the recently repaired aorta. We divided the colon at the rectosigmoid junction. Proximally, we divided the colon at the middle of the transverse colon (Fig. b). The mesentery was divided to include the LCA aneurysms. Given her clinical condition, we elected to not perform a colorectal anastomosis, but instead performed a Hartmann’s procedure with an end transverse colon colostomy. The surgery took 145 min, and the estimated blood loss was 4.5 L. Packed red blood cell transfusion volume was approximately 1.96 L, and fresh frozen plasma volume was 1.44 L.
In reviewing the specimens, a 2-cm aneurysmal sac and 1-cm aneurysmal sac were identified in the LCA. No thrombus was identified (Fig. a, b). No ischemic changes and no tumor were observed in the excised colon (Fig. c). Interestingly, fibrous tissue around the left colic artery stained positive for S-100 protein, suggesting that neurofibroma from NF1 might have been associated with the rupture of these aneurysms due to weakened integrity of the vascular walls (Fig. a–e). A follow-up abdominal CT showed no recurrence of the endoleak. The patient was discharged 37 days after the last operation without any other post-operative complications.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"Patient (3) is a 4 years old boy, the third in order of birth of first cousin marriage. He presented to the hepatology clinic with jaundice following an attack of vomiting and diarrhea. He had a similar attack at the age of two years that regressed spontaneously.
On examination the patient had progressive neurologic dysfunction, his height was 95 cm (-2 SD), weight was 13 kg (-3 SD) and skull circumference was 43 cm. He had characteristic physical appearance with enophthalmia, nystagmus, jaundice, and skin photosensitivity. His liver was 4 cm below the costal margin, firm in consistency with rounded border and smooth surface. The spleen was felt two cm below the costal margin. Neurological examination showed intention tremors, cerebellar ataxia, lost knee and preserved ankle deep reflexes. Chest and heart examination were clinically free.
Investigations at that time revealed ALT: 270 IU/L (N: 37), AST: 232 IU/L (N: 40) GGT: 183 (N: 50), total bilirubin: 3.35 mg/dl, direct bilirubin: 2.6 mg/dl, albumin: 3.2 g/dl, PT 11.7 sec. (INR: 1). Tests for HBV, HCV, and HAV revealed negative results. Ceruloplasmin level, protein electrophoresis and auto antibodies were also normal.
Abdominal ultrasonography revealed enlarged liver with regular border, homogenous echopatteren, patent portal and hepatic veins. Fundus examination showed no abnormality. CT brain was normal, while MRI brain showed deep white matter signal alteration at the forceps minor and major regions, middle cerebellar peduncles, the posterior segmental aspects of the pontine isthmus and basis pontis. Those areas exhibited bright signal on FLAIR and T2W1, a picture consistent with dysmyelinating disease.
The patient received ursodeoxycholic acid at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day and vitamin E (100 mg/day). Two months later, ALT decreased to 83 IU/L, AST decreased to 95 IU/L, total bilirubin was: 1.7 mg/dl, direct bilirubin: 0.7 mg/dl, albumin: 3.2 g/dl, and PT 11.3 seconds.
Six months later, the patient had another similar attack that was also precipitated by viral infection and was associated with increased tremors, ataxia and inability to walk. He received the same treatment with excellent response and complete recovery of liver functions, and improvement of ataxia, and tremors.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 27-year-old man complained of 2-month history of nasal stuffiness, epistaxis and maxillary sinus pain. One month later, he developed painful swellings over the outer part of both eyes. He was diagnosed elsewhere as presumed lid abscess and managed with antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) and drainage of purulent material from these swellings. He presented to us after another month with recurrence of eye swelling along with new development of dry cough. There was no history of redness of eyes, blurring of vision, diplopia, dry eyes, hemoptysis, dyspnea, fever, oliguria, hematuria, skin rash, tingling, burning or weakness in extremities, headache, seizures or altered sensorium. Examination revealed bilateral S-shaped swelling diagnosed as lacrimal gland swelling [] by our ophthalmologist. There was bilateral ptosis but no ophthalmoplegia or Horner’s syndrome. There was no uveitis or retinal involvement. The patient was normotensive and systemic examination was unremarkable. Investigations revealed polymorphonuclear leukocytosis and thrombocytosis. Complement proteins C3, C4 and renal functions were normal. Urine examination revealed active sediments [white blood cells (WBC) 20-25/high power field (HPF), red blood cells (RBC) 6-8/HPF], but no albuminuria. Chest radiography and computerized tomography (CT) scan showed nodular and cavitating lesions [Fig. , ]. CT orbit did not reveal any retro-orbital mass. Culture of pus from past incisions over lacrimal gland did not reveal any organism. Incisional biopsy done from lateral aspect of left lacrimal gland swelling showed fibro-areolar tissue with necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis[]. Positive cytoplasmic-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (c-ANCA) and high serine proteinase-3 levels (366 U/ml; normal <16 U/ml) confirmed the diagnosis of WG. The patient was treated with initial regimen of daily oral cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg) and oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg) which was gradually tapered after initial remission was obtained.
A month later, there was complete regression of lacrimal gland swelling, but left-sided ptosis [] continued to persist. He also developed marked dryness of eyes and Schirmer’s I test was positive (2 mm wetting in both the eyes after 5 minutes). There was no dry mouth, diplopia or ophthalmoplegia. Antinuclear, anti Ro and anti La antibodies were negative. There was complete regression of lung cavities with the above treatment after 3 months. After 1 year of follow-up, the patient was in complete remission with no recurrence of lacrimal gland swelling or lung lesions. However, ptosis of the left eye and ocular dryness continued to persist and the patient required frequent instillations of artificial tear drops.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 55-year-old man accidentally inhaled a chlorine cloud when cleaning the swimming
pool at his home, evolving to a clinical picture of mild dyspnea, cough with mucoid
sputum, and epigastric pain. He sought emergency care (after 30 minutes), where he
was initially evaluated for respiratory symptoms and received venous hydration,
bronchodilators, and oxygen therapy. However, he presented progressive clinical
worsening over a 3-hour period, with increased expectoration, arterial oxygen
saturation (SpO2) (from 95% to 60%), and cyanosis and was referred to the
reference emergency room, where he was seen in the emergency department. At that
time, he already had signs of acute respiratory failure, associated with intense
burning chest pain and cough with blood-tinged sputum. There was no history of
smoking, respiratory diseases, and other comorbidities.
At admission, the patient was afebrile, tachycardic (heart rate 110bpm), and
tachypneic (respiratory rate 34bpm), with a blood pressure of 134/82mmHg and an
SpO2 of 86% during oxygen macronebulization at 10L/minute. Chest
expandability was decreased due to pain, and respiratory auscultation detected the
presence of generalized decreased vesicular murmur and crackling rales mainly on the
lung bases. No other changes were detected on physical examination. Noninvasive
ventilation with 60% FiO2, 7cmH2O support pressure (SP), and
10cmH2O positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was started.
Arterial blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.41, a partial carbon dioxide pressure
(PaCO2) of 39.1mmHg, a partial oxygen pressure (PaO2) of
59.5mmHg, an oxygen saturation (SO2) of 87.4%, a bicarbonate level of
29mEq/L and a base excess of +0.7mmol/L. The patient had leukocytosis (leukocyte
count of 27,840 thousand/mm3 with 94% segmented). Electrolytes,
coagulation tests, and liver and canalicular enzymes were normal. Chest X-ray
revealed bilateral alveolar infiltrate in the lower third (). Chest tomography showed consolidation in the
posterior region of the lower lobes and discrete in the upper lobes, associated with
areas of diffuse ground-glass opacity in the upper lobes, in addition to an increase
in the diameter of the pulmonary arterial trunk (3.8cm), indicating hypertension of
the same ().
In the intensive care unit, antibiotic therapy with cefepime (2g every 8 hours),
intravenous corticosteroid (methylprednisolone 125mg every 6 hours), and
nebulization with a beta-agonist and an anticholinergic were started, with
progressive clinical improvement and noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV)
maintained intermittently for 4 days. A Dixtal® 3010 mechanical
ventilator with a full face mask interface was used in SP mode, using SP for a
target tidal volume of approximately 6 to 8mL/kg predicted weight and a PEEP ranging
from 5 to 10cmH2O, in addition to an FiO2 required to maintain
an oxygen saturation above 88%. On the first day, the patient remained on a zero
diet and remained on NIV for 24 hours; the PaO2/FiO2 ratio was
99. On the second day, pauses were taken for oral feeding; the
PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 150. On the third day, most NIV shifts
were maintained but with larger pauses; the PaO2/FiO2 ratio
was 230. On the fourth day, NIV was performed intermittently; the
PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 350. On the fifth day, the patient was
kept on oxygen macronebulization. On the sixth day and following until hospital
discharge, which occurred on the seventh day, the patient was spontaneously
ventilated with room air. He remained hemodynamically stable throughout his hospital
stay, without organ dysfunctions. He was discharged on the seventh day of
hospitalization and was given an oral corticosteroid and a bronchodilator. In his
outpatient follow-up, he underwent a chest X-ray, showing dense striae in the right
upper lobe (), with no other
alterations. Spirometry was also performed but did not show alterations.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 45-year-old South Asian woman presented with a progressively worsening of proximal muscle weakness. Initially there was a mild pain in her thighs and arms which was followed by a difficulty getting up from the seated position and inability of raising her arms. There was no dysphagia, regurgitation or difficulty in breathing. During this particular presentation there was no dermatological manifestations suggestive of dermatomyositis or mechanic’s hands. There was no history suggestive of Raynaud’s phenomenon or any joint pains. There was a mild nonproductive cough which developed a few weeks after the onset of the muscle symptoms without any notable shortness of breath of exertion or wheezing. There was no other evidence of any connective tissue diseases.
There was no ptosis, double vision or fatiguability to suggestive myasthenia. Patient appeared to be clinically euthyroid without any overt features of hypothyroidism. There was no history of statin use at the time of the presentation or prior to that. Patient denied any similar history previously nor was there a history of a similar disease among her family members.
Examination revealed bilateral symmetrical proximal muscle weakness with a muscle power of 4/5 in all four limbs. Reflexes were intact without any muscle wasting. There were no overt features of dermatomyositis. Auscultation of the lungs revealed a few bilateral basal fine end inspiratory crepitations suggestive an interstitial lung disease. Second heart sound was of normal intensity. A diagnosis of inflammatory myositis was considered with a concurrent interstitial lung disease. With this clinical text she was thoroughly investigated.
Creatinine phosphokinase levels were elevated with a value of 1435 u/l. Inflammatory markers were elevated with a ESR of 54 though the CRP was only slightly elevated. ANA was negative. Findings on electromyography was consistent with an inflammatory myositis. Muscle biopsy which was carried out revealed inflammatory cells in between the muscle fibers causing complete necrosis of some of the muscle fibers. Anti Jo-1 antibody was positive. HRCT revealed bilateral homogenous sub pleural basal ground glass opacification suggestive of non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (Fig. ). She was started on oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day with azathioprine 50 mg per day which was later increased to 100 mg per day. Subsequently her muscle power improved, CPK levels normalized and the cough which was present improved.
She attended her follow up clinic visits and was compliant with her medication. She was in remission for 2 years with low dose prednisolone and azathioprine. She was asymptomatic with no muscle pains, proximal muscle weakness and CPK levels were within normal range. She continued to be free from any cough or shortness of breath. ESR was persistently normal with values in the mid 20’s.
Following a period of unsatisfactory compliance of 4 weeks, she presented with fissuring and cracking of the fingers suggestive of mechanic’s hands (Fig. ) without any muscle pain or weakness. She denied any recurrence of the cough which she had during the initial disease presentation and did not have any shortness of breath. Her CPK was within normal limits at that time. Though there was no evidence of a systemic relapse, the steroid dose was up titrated while continuing azathioprine. However, the mechanic’s hands did not improve and subsequently in the following month she started to complain of a pain in her thighs and arms with a subtle weakness. Her CPK had risen to 1427 u/L and ESR risen to 47. Given the overall clinical picture it was decided that she required escalation of her immunosuppressive therapy. She was started on IV cyclophosphamide 500 mg every 2 weekly and after 3 doses the skin manifestations started to resolve and CPK had normalized (Fig. ). Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily was added as patient had prominent dermatological manifestations with photosensitivity (Table ).
Repeat HRCT revealed stable nonspecific interstitial pneumoniae without any radiological progression. Lung function tests revealed a restrictive lung disease with a FVC of 78% of predicted, FEV1 of 94% of predicted with FEV1/FVC of 124%. DLCO was 49%.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"We report on a patient who had undergone out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The 61 years old female patient was without any significant previous illness and did not take any medication regularly. The collapse was preceded by malaise and nausea for 10 min. The patient’s partner started cardiopulmonary resuscitation after calling the rescue service. The emergency physician diagnosed ventricular fibrillation (Fig. a), which was defibrillated 6 times in total. After 20 min spontaneous circulation was restored. Immediate transfer to our cardiac catheterization laboratory took place. Coronary artery disease was ruled out invasively (Fig. ). High-sensitivity troponin was repeatedly negative. Pulmonary embolism and subarachnoid hemorrhage were ruled out by means of CT. The 12-lead ECG showed negative T-waves in the inferior leads (Fig. b). Thus, no obvious cause for the ventricular fibrillation could be determined initially.
Physical examination on admission: Obese 61-year-old woman (BMI 30.1 kg/m2), pulse 60/min, blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, temperature 36 °C, O2 saturation 94% under mechanical ventilation. Heart, lungs, and abdomen unremarkable. Laboratory studies: Complete blood count: unremarkable. Plasma coagulation study: normal, D-dimers within normal limits, Clinical chemistry: C-reactive protein 6 mg/L (normal 5 mg/L), all other values within normal limits. ECG: Sinus rhythm, HF 60, no AV-Block, no QT time prolongation, inverted T-waves in the inferior leads (III, aVF) (Fig. b). Fast echocardiography: Normal systolic right and left ventricular systolic function, severe mitral regurgitation, no pericardial effusion. Chest x-ray: Normal cardiac size with evidence of pulmonary venous congestion.
Intensive care therapy achieved stabilization of the patient’s general condition. Controlled ventilation was stopped on the fourth day. Except for a hypoactive delirium, which was adequately controlled by administration of a neuroleptikum, no neurological deficits were manifested.
Evaluation of the 12-lead ECG did not reveal any evidence of ECG changes, which are normally associated with canalopathies (Brugada, ARVC, long-, short QT syndromes etc.).
However, we have registered recurrent ventricular salves during monitoring (Fig. c). In addition, we registered a short-lasting atrial fibrillation with spontaneous termination (Fig. d). Therefore, oral anticoagulation was initiated.
Follow-up echocardiography showed a significant mitral valve insufficiency with preserved left ventricular pump function. The left ventricle demonstrated mild endsystolic and enddiastolic dilatation. A severe dilatation of the left atrium (LA area 45 cm2) was noticed (Fig. a). The lateral mitral annular velocities was quantified with Doppler tissue imaging. The peak systolic lateral mitral annulus velocity was 18 cm/s (Fig. b).
Transesophageal echocardiography was performed to evaluate the mitral valve more precisely. A high-grade eccentric mitral valve insufficiency due to a pronounced PML and a mild AML prolapse could be demonstrated (Fig. c). Especially the PML showed thickening and myxomatous changes (Fig. d). The tendinous chordae appeared to be intact.
For further clarification of the arrhythmogenic event, we ordered a CMR. This exploration has shown a discreet mid-wall LGE in the LV inferobasal region (Fig. a). Additionally, LGE of the PM was visible on mid short-axis view (Fig. b). The right ventricle showed no pathology by echocardiography and CMR. A significant mitral annulus disjunction (MAD) measuring 11,2 mm was identified. (Fig. c).
Regarding the severe mitral valvular insufficiency due to the MVP, the case was discussed in the heart team. It was decided to provide the patient with an internal automatic cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) first and to repair the mitral valve by mini invasive surgery in 3 months.
The patient showed regression of the delirium and an increasing mobility. After implantation of an ICD device (Fig. a), the patient was discharged in good general condition and without significant neurological deficits. A cardio-neurological rehabilitation was organized. The first ICD follow-up analysis after 3 Weeks did not show any arrhythmogenic events. At the 3 months ICD follow up, few days after the mitral valve reconstruction, we detected a VT, which has been successfully electrocardioverted (Fig. b).","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"The 37-year-old woman presented with a three-month history of continuous pain in the right shoulder and chest. She was taken to our department of cardiothoracic surgery. Physical examination was remarkable for palpable lymph nodes in the bilateral supraclavicular fossae. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed an oval mass located in the anterior mediastinum. Circumambient lung tissue was involved. Haematological findings were: WBC 15.40 × 109/L, platelets 364 × 109/L, prothrombin time 10.3 sec. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), blood biochemistry, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, urine analysis and the endocrine profile were within normal range except hemoglobin (106 g/L) and tumor specific growth factor (67 U/ML). The abdominal ultrasonography did not reveal any other abnormality.
The surgery was performed with the patient under general anesthesia and left lateral decubitus position. The procedure revealed an oval tumor, volume of which was 7 cm × 4.5 cm × 2.5 cm, in the anterior mediastinum and circumambient lung tissue was involved. Pathologic findings during surgery showed that the tumor was off-white with obscure boundaries and hard in consistence (Figure ). The result of pathology hinted that the tumor maybe malignant lymphoma. The tumor and circumambient lung tissue which was involved were excised.
Histology showed the tumor was nodular and different nodules were separated by collagen fibers (Figure ). There were two morphologically and immunophenotypically distinct components. The great mass of nodules showed a pleomorphic cellular infiltrate containing lymphocyte, eosinophile granulocyte, neutrophile granulocyte and numerous large Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg cells. The Reed-Sternberg cells were positive for CD30, CD15 and MUM1 but negative for CD20, CD79a, CD3, Pax-5, CD68, bcl-6, CD10, CD45, Igκ, Igλ and epithelial membrane antigen (Figure , Figure ). Other nodules displayed sheets of relatively uniform large lymphoid cells with typical morphologic features of large cell lymphoma which showed uniform expression of CD20, CD79a, MUM1, CD45, Igλ, Pax-5 and absence of CD30, CD15, CD3, CD10, bcl-6, Igκ, CD68 and epithelial membrane antigen (Figure , Figure ). All the primary antibodies are listed in Table . Neither cell population showed makers of EBV infection by EBER in situ hybridization (PanPath Company, Amsterdam, Netherlands). On the basis of histomorphology at light microscopy, the presence of immunohistochemical staining and in situ hybridization, a diagnosis of CL, combination of NSHL and DLBCL, in the anterior mediastinum was made. The patient received six courses of CHOP chemotherapy (a course of treatment every two weeks) and twenty three times radiotherapy (Gross Tumor Volume, GTV = 40Gy/20f; Planning Target Volume, PTV = 36 Gy/20f). After treatment, lymph nodes in the bilateral supraclavicular fossa disappeared. The total follow-up period was thirty three months after surgery. The repeated CT scans, abdominal ultrasonography and tumor specific growth factor every three months revealed no recurring or residual lesion.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 50-year-old female patient, known case of hypertension (HTN) and taking normatin as a medication, was in her usual state of health until 6 months prior to admission when she started to complain from headache, tinnitus and vertigo. She sought medical advice and was treated as otitis media (according to the patient).
Before ten days from her admission to our hospital, she had episodes of imbalance while she was walking and recurrent vomiting.
Once again, she sought medical help and, after a brain CT and a brain MRI were done, the doctors found a left cerebellar tumor (). In the upcoming days, she was referred to our hospital in April 2019 for further evaluation and surgical management.
The patient came to our hospital by her own (using public transportation) because there were no facilities for the tumor management in other places and there was no need to being transported by ambulance.
We did a physical examination focused on a neurological examination due to her symptoms and diagnosis. The patient was conscious, oriented and alert, with a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 15/15.
The cranial nerves were intact, and she was positive for cerebellar signs. She also was positive for the Romberg sign, had an ataxic gait and could not perform the tandem gait.
The patient then underwent surgery in which a midline suboccipital craniectomy with microscopic gross total resection (GTR) of the left cerebellar tumor and a cranioplasty under neuromonitoring was performed successfully.
The surgery was smooth and without intraoperative complications with an estimated blood loss of 500 cc.
After the surgery, the patient was transferred to the ICU in good conditions with stable vital signs, conscious, oriented, alert and a GCS of 15/15. The cranial nerves were intact, she was able to move all limbs freely and the wound was dry and clean. Afterwards, she was discharged in good conditions, with stable vital signs and no complications or sequela.
According to the histology department, the specimen that they received in formalin consisted of a multiple pieces and fragments of a grayish tissue measuring in aggregate 7.5 × 5 cm grossly. Further microscopic investigations of the histologic sections showed a biphasic tumor with a mixture of neurocytes and lipidized cells in which the neurocytes were arranged in density cellular sheets of monotonous cells with scanty and often clear cytoplasm, rounded to oval nuclei and salt-and-pepper chromatin. Lipidized cells were clustered and resembling mature adipocytes.
Rare mitotic figures were noted and were investigated. The tumor cells were positive for synaptophysin and neuron specific enolase (ESN) immunostains, focal for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and negative for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA).
With all these histological findings, it was concluded that the sample was consistent with a cerebellar liponeurocytoma, WHO grade 2.
After a month from the operation, the patient came to the out-patient clinic for follow-up in which we could see that she was in good conditions, with no complains and the cerebellar signs were gone. Since there was no residual tumor left after the surgery and there were no symptoms showing us cerebellar involvement, there was no need for our patient to take radiotherapy once she was discharged.
Since the patient did not come to us again, we suspect that she is not complaining from any other symptom in the neurosurgical field.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 19-year-old female with no significant past medical history was referred to the emergency department from her antenatal clinic for further evaluation of fever 102 F, headache, malaise, nausea, and vomiting of 4-days duration following mild sore throat. She was in her 28th week of gestation on presentation. Physical examination showed an obese and anxious-appearing lady in mild respiratory distress with gravid abdomen. She weighed 142 kilograms (kg) with a BMI of 44.3. Her blood pressure was 111/60 mmHg, respiratory rate 24, heart rate 111, temperature 101.8 F, and oxygen saturation 96% on 2 liters (L) nasal cannula oxygen. She had dry mucous membranes, with no oral thrush or ulcers. Her abdomen was gravid with focal areas of tenderness, bowel sounds were heard, and fetal movement was detected. Pulmonary and cardiovascular examinations were unremarkable.
Her initial laboratory tests were significant for white blood cell (WBC) count of 11.8 K/uL with 78% neutrophil predominance and lymphopenia (0.77 K/uL). Although she had no urinary symptoms, urinalysis showed bacteriuria, confirmed as group B streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) with cultures. Initial chest X-ray and liver enzymes on admission were unremarkable. She was started on intravenous fluids for suspected gastroenteritis and oral cephalexin for asymptomatic GBS infection. Stool studies for clostridium difficile, comprehensive panel, ova, and parasites were ordered which all returned negative. However, she continued to spike fever through the third day of hospitalization prompting expansion of antibiotic coverage to Vancomycin and Zosyn (). Liver transaminases which had been normal began to spike. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 190, alanine aminotransferase (AST) was 135, and alkaline phosphatase was 110 while bilirubin remained normal. Serum Tylenol and hepatitis A, B, and C serologies were negative. Infectious Disease (ID) consultation was requested who recommended further infectious work-up with CMV, EBV, HIV, HSV, Rickettsia, and Leptospira serologies.
The patient continued to spike high grade fever reaching 103 F on day 4 of admission despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics and negative infectious work-up including the aforementioned serologies. She also developed bloody diarrhea and acute kidney injury (AKI) prompting evaluation for possible Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and autoimmune diseases which all returned negative as well. Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed normal liver and gallbladder morphologies. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed diffuse T2 hyperintensity throughout the liver compatible with acute liver injury but was negative for any focal intra-abdominal or pelvic abscess.
One week into her hospitalization, her AST and ALT kept trending up reaching a peak of 1712 U/L and 845 U/L, respectively (), mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase 140, INR 1.6, normal total bilirubin, absolute lymphocyte count of 0.11 K/uL, persistently negative blood cultures, and serum creatinine increased to 2.9 mg/dL, all concerning for a disseminated process. She became increasingly lethargic, tachycardic, and tachypneic necessitating care in the intensive care unit. With uprising liver enzymes and negative extensive infectious and rheumatologic work-up including Hep A, B, C serologies and PCR, EBV, CMV, Parvovirus, Rickettsia, and Leptospiral serologies, as well as negative HSV 1 and 2 IgM and IgG antibodies, antinuclear, and anti-liver-kidney microsomal antibodies, normal cryoglobulins, ceruloplasmin, alpha 1 antitrypsin and serum copper levels, and largely unremarkable imaging and stool studies, a decision was made to proceed with a liver biopsy. At this time, empiric acyclovir was started while other antibiotics were discontinued per ID recommendations.
Within the first 24 hours of starting acyclovir, AST and ALT began to downtrend while fever and diarrhea improved (). Despite negative HSV-2 serologies, the PCR was reported on hospital day-8 with a very high viral load >100 million DNA copies/ml following which she reported a remote history of cold sores but denied a history of genital ulcers. A diagnosis of HSV hepatitis was made and she was transitioned to Val-acyclovir 1 gram three times daily to complete 14 days of therapy, then to resume acyclovir 400 mg three times daily until delivery to prevent recurrence. On the 12th day of hospitalization, she was discharged home without needing a biopsy anymore and with complete resolution of symptoms and improvement of liver enzymes and AKI; AST 72, ALT 208, alkaline phosphatase 150, total bilirubin 0.5 and creatinine 0.5. She remained symptom-free with complete normalization of creatinine and liver enzymes at outpatient follow-up two weeks after discharge. She was eventually delivered of a healthy baby boy via cesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation with no peripartum complications.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year. Exclusion Criteria: Younger than 65 years old, having decompensated liver disease, psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance, having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy.",1
"A 63-year-old man presented with exertional dyspnea in the background of normal cardiac evaluation, and computer tomography (CT) findings of a vascular malformation in the posterior mediastinum (). The malformation was supplied by 4 arteries (right bronchial artery and three intercostals) arising from the thoracic aorta with a large vascular mass in the posterior mediastinum and single drainage vessel into the right upper lobe pulmonary artery (). The appearance was consistent with a BP-AVM.
In view of the size and the risk of hemoptysis, the patient was referred for embolization. Through a left common femoral vein access, the right upper lobe pulmonary was accessed. The drainage vessel arising the superior segmental artery of the right upper lobe was first cannulated. However, due to the angulation of the artery with sheath instability, a tri-axial system was needed to allow deep catheterization required for vascular plug embolization (). This consisted of an 8.5F Agilis NxT (St Jude Medical, Minnetonka, MN, USA) steerable sheath positioned in the ostium of the segmental artery, followed by an 8F Mach 1 guiding catheter (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) and a 5F 125 cm long Ultimate 1 diagnostic catheter (Merit Medical Systems, Inc., South Jordan, UT, USA) inserted co-axially. In a telescoping fashion, the guiding catheter was advanced over the diagnostic catheter and guidewire to reach a stable position within the segmental pulmonary artery, and a 16 mm Amplatzer AVP II vascular plug (St Jude Medical) was deployed, occluding the solitary drainage pulmonary artery ().
Through a right common femoral artery access, aortography demonstrated the 4 feeding arteries as seen on CT (). The plan was for staged coil/plug embolization (without particulate embolics) of the feeding arteries (2 arteries in a single sitting) due to the difficulty in resolving any potential spinal supply. If needed, we would return for an interval embolization of the remaining two vessels. The largest supplying artery (intercostal artery) was first cannulated and a 6F Brite-tip sheath (Cordis, Miami, FL, USA) was used to deliver a 12 mm AVP II plug successfully deployed (). The hypertrophied right bronchial artery was then accessed using a Progreat microcatheter and embolized using a total of 8 Interlock coils ranging from 5 to 12 mm in size (Boston Scientific) (). Completion angiography showed complete embolization of the two vessels with significant slow flow into the malformation through the remaining two untreated arteries ().
The immediate post-embolization CT at day 1 showed significant thrombosis of the BP-AVM () and the patient was discharged well. At 6 months follow-up CT, complete thrombosis with a significant reduction in size of the BP-AVM was demonstrated (). The patient reported improvement in effort tolerance from previous modified Medical Research Council score (mMRC) of 3 to 1 over the same period and remained so at 1 year.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 34-year-old Haitian man with no past medical history presented with initial complaints of ataxia. He reported an unprotected sexual encounter 4 years ago with a suspected HIV-positive partner and was subsequently newly diagnosed with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). CD4 cell count was 37.56 cells/mm3 [6.83%], CD8 357.82 cells/mm3, CD4/CD8 ratio 0.1 and plasma HIV viral load 459,020 copies/mL.
Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on admission showed increased T2 FLAIR in the brainstem and cerebellum, as well as bilateral, but asymmetrical involvement of the cerebellar peduncles, not consistent with intracranial mass or acute stroke (). Lumbar puncture (LP) showed: white blood cells 2/μL, red blood cells 140/μL, glucose 51 mg/dL, total protein 48 mg/dL, lymphocytes 94/μL, monocytes 6/μL. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for JC virus returned as 6400 copies/mL, suggestive of PML. Other CSF studies were unremarkable, including: Cryptococcus neoformans antigen, venereal disease research laboratory test (VDRL), Toxoplasma gondii PCR, meningoencephalitis panel, Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR, Epstein Barr virus (EBV) PCR, cytomegalovirus (CMV) PCR, herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and -2 (PCR), varicella zoster virus (VZV) PCR, adenosine deaminase (ADA), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and acid-fast bacilli culture and smear. Serum serological testing was positive for Toxoplasma gondii, but otherwise negative. Other negative blood tests include EBV PCR, CMV PCR, hepatitis panel, and interferon gamma release assay. CSF cytology and flow cytometry were negative for malignancy including B- or T-cell lymphoma.
High concern for PML was raised; less likely toxoplasmosis or IRIS, as the patient was not on ART at the time. Differential considerations for his imaging appearance included CNS lymphoma, neurosarcoidosis, and cerebritis-meningitis among others. The patient was initiated on bictegravir 50 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg and prophylaxis against opportunistic infections notably Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. After 2 weeks of ART, the viral load decreased significantly to 1400 copies/mL.
Two months after the initial presentation and despite compliance to ART, the patient was re-admitted for progressive neurological complaints, including worsening ataxia, now unable to stand or walk without assistance. The physical exam was notable for right facial droop, decreased sensation over the right face, marked dysmetria with finger-to-nose testing, and dysdiadochokinesia. He had significant ataxic gait but full muscle strength and negative pronator drift or nuchal rigidity. Repeat CSF studies were unrevealing. Brain MRI was concerning for worsening of previous PML lesions with multifocal brainstem and cerebellar T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions, new extensive leptomeningeal and perivascular enhancement, and mass effect (). Repeat T- lymphocyte subsets/HIV studies at this time showed: CD4 cell count 252 cells/mm3 [7.94%], CD8 2430.4 cells/mm3, CD4/CD8 ratio 0.1 and plasma HIV viral load decreased to 106 copies/mL. In the setting of radiologic and clinical progression of disease with recently diagnosed AIDS and ART initiation 1 month prior, paradoxical cerebellar PML-IRIS was diagnosed. While ART was continued, he was also started on an adjunctive intravenous methylprednisolone course 1 g daily for 5 days, followed by an oral prednisone taper 60 mg per day, with taper over 6 weeks and close outpatient follow up. The patient was discharged after 5 days of hospital stay.
Patient did not return to receive care at our institution, but had 2 readmissions at an outside hospital within 20 miles to our hospital facility. The first readmission after discharge from our institution occurred within one week with symptoms of nausea, vomiting and gait dysfunction. Brain MRI again showed right cerebellar vasogenic edema with enhancing lesions in the left cerebral peduncle and extension to the pons, left cerebellar peduncle and right medullary edema. Repeat LP studies at this time was positive for JC virus PCR. He was treated again with a course of intravenous corticosteroids. Follow up CD4 count was 101 cells/mm3 and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was continued for opportunistic infection prophylaxis. The patient was subsequently discharged to a rehabilitation treatment center after 4 weeks hospital stay.
One month after leaving the rehabilitation program, the patient was readmitted again with symptoms of nausea, vomiting and blurry vision. Repeat brain MRI showed a new 6 mm enhancing focus in the medulla in addition to imaging findings very similar to his last hospital stay. Work up for lymphoma and other malignancy was negative even though CSF studies were positive for EBV PCR in addition to JC virus. Patient again got a course of intravenous steroids. A repeat MRI performed after completion of intravenous steroids showed significant improvement of lesions. He was discharged home with outpatient physical therapy and his functional status continues to improve as of the time of this report.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A previously healthy 22-year-old Japanese man without a medical or surgical history presented to Anjo Kosei Hospital with complaints of fever and dyspnea. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 37.8°C and tachycardia. CT scans revealed a 14.4 × 9.8 × 10.0 cm mass in the anterior mediastinum with compression of the heart. Pertinent laboratory values included an AFP level of 31,536 ng/mL and an LDH level of 604 IU/L. His hCG level was within the normal range. Physical examination of the testes showed no neoplastic parenchymal involvement. A needle core biopsy revealed a malignant germ cell tumor, and immunohistochemical staining was positive for AFP. From these data, the patient was finally diagnosed with a yolk sac tumor.
The patient received combination chemotherapy consisting of BEP every 3 weeks for a total of 3 cycles. After that, an additional 2 cycles of EP chemotherapy were administered in order to normalize his serum tumor marker levels. His AFP level decreased to 46 ng/mL after 3 cycles of BEP and further normalized after 2 cycles of EP. After 5 courses of preoperative chemotherapy, resection of the tumor was performed, resulting in a complete pathologic response (). The patient is alive and in CR without any evidence of recurrence.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 65-year-old Caucasian woman presented in March 2007 with a 3-month history of painless left-sided cervical lymphadenopathy. She denied any associated fevers, chills, loss of weight, dyspnea, dysphagia, or any other symptoms. The patient's surgical history was pertinent for a completely resected stage IA melanoma over the left shoulder 16 years before this presentation. Physical exam revealed enlarged and non-tender cervical and axillary lymph nodes without splenomegaly. A skin survey did not reveal any new nevi or concerning lesions. A complete blood picture showed a white blood cell count of 14.7 × 103/μL, an absolute lymphocyte count of 7.35 × 103/μL, hemoglobin of 13.8 g/dL, a platelet count of 258 × 103/μL, and lactate dehydrogenase of 291 U/L. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood demonstrated a monoclonal lymphocyte population expressing CD5, CD19, CD20, CD24, CD43, and CD52 with lambda light chain restriction and no increase in CD34-positive blasts. The cells were negative for CD38 and ZAP-70. Based on the above findings, the patient was diagnosed with Rai Stage I CLL and placed under observation.
Two years after her initial diagnosis, the patient presented with progressive dyspnea, associated with pleuritic chest pain and a 20 lbs weight loss over a period of 3 months. Physical examination revealed increased axillary and cervical lymphadenopathy and decreased breath sounds over the right lung. Chest X-ray revealed a large right-sided pleural effusion (Fig. ). White blood cell count was noted to be 53.4 × 103/μL, and she had an absolute lymphocyte count of 40.7 × 103/μL. The pleural fluid analysis was consistent with an exudative effusion, with increased atypical lymphocytes. Flow cytometry demonstrated a 12% clonal population consistent with the pleural involvement of CLL. The majority of the lymphocytes were CD4+ T-lymphocytes (CD4:CD8 in a ratio of 15: 1), but polymerase chain reaction failed to show any clonal T-cell receptor-γ or T-cell receptor-β gene rearrangements.
Secondary to rapid reaccumulation of pleural fluid, increasing lymphadenopathy, and rapid doubling time of lymphocyte count, the decision to treat symptomatic CLL was made. Chemotherapy with pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab did not result in any meaningful clinical response. As the patient's pleural effusion was refractory to CLL treatment, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was performed, which demonstrated diffuse nodular thickening of both visceral and parietal layers of the pleura (Fig. ). A biopsy of these lesions revealed enlarged cells with an increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and pleomorphic nuclei with occasional cherry red nucleoli (Fig. ). Immunohistochemistry studies demonstrated positive staining with HMB-45 (Fig. ) and S-100 protein. Electron microscopy revealed type II melanosomes with cross-striated lattice in an enclosed membrane (Fig. ), type III melanosomes with increased deposition of electron-dense melanin, and type IV melanosomes with highly electron-dense melanin (Fig. ). Based on the above findings, a diagnosis of malignant melanoma was made. Computed tomography of the chest revealed extensive lobulated tumor lining the entirety of the right parietal pleural surface without any evidence of parenchymal involvement. The patient's medical condition rapidly declined, and she ultimately succumbed to death before initiation of any therapy.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 57 year old male presented with unstable angina. Risk factors included hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. Significant past history included multiple episodes of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Coronary angiography demonstrated a single coronary artery arising from left coronary sinus (fig ) which divided into a normal sized left anterior descending artery (LAD) and a circumflex (Cx) artery. LAD had a 99% stenotic lesion beyond the first septal and was a good sized vessel going just beyond the left ventricular apex (Fig ). From its proximal segment, beyond the origin of first diagonal and prior to the origin of first septal artery, arose 3 right ventricular branches, the largest of which crossed the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), 2 centimetres below the pulmonary valve, to gain the anterior right atrioventricular groove (Fig , ), descended in the groove to anastomose with the distal right coronary artery (Fig ), which arose as a continuity of the circumflex artery (Fig ), as described below. The second right ventricular branch crossed the RVOT below the first but petered out well before it could gain the anterior right AV groove. The third branch supplied the right ventricle and followed a course close to the LAD (fig ). The diagonal artery was a large bifurcating artery with significant proximal stenosis. The circumflex artery had severe stenosis proximally after which it gave a large obtuse marginal branch and then the PDA in the posterior interventricular groove and thereafter continued in the AV groove as the right coronary artery (Fig ). This right coronary artery then gave off a ventricular branch to the inferior surface of the right ventricle and thereafter anastomosed with the proximal RCA arising anomalously from the LAD as described above (Fig ). There was no stenotic lesion in this composite, anomalously arising proximal and distal right coronary arterial system.
Patient was taken to theatre for urgent CABG. Operative findings confirmed the following: Proximal RCA was arising as a branch from the proximal LAD after the first diagonal, crossed the RVOT and gained the anterior aspect of the right AV groove to anastomose with the distal RCA which arose as a continuity of circumflex artery. LAD gave off two further branches to supply the right ventricle (Fig ). The distal circumflex continued to the crux of the heart, gave off PDA in the posterior interventricular groove (Fig ) and thereafter continued as RCA till just above the acute margin of right ventricle. This distal RCA also gave off a right ventricular branch to the inferior right ventricular surface below the acute margin of the heart (Fig ). Employing cardiopulmonary bypass, with antegrade cold blood cardioplegic arrest, quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting was performed. Left internal mammary artery (LIMA) graft was anastomosed to LAD and separate saphenous vein bypass grafts were constructed to Dx, OM Cx and PDA from Cx. Bypass was discontinued easily in sinus rhythm, without ionotropes and patient transferred to ICU in a satisfactory haemodynamic condition. He was transferred to ward on first postoperative day and home 8 days after surgery.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 68 years old male had undergone total mesorectal excision 10 years before a skeletal metastasis of the lower leg was diagnosed. The patient was otherwise healthy except mild hypertension and there was no familial accumulation of endocrine or malignant diseases. Histology from the primary surgery showed a 5 cm intermediately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the rectum with no signs of neuroendocrine biology. The tumor was CK7 negative and CK20 positive. Distance to the nearest circumferential margin was 3 mm, and end resection margins were clear. There was no infiltration in the removed lymph nodes nor signs of distant metastases, thus the final TNM status was pT3N0M0. Total calcium was normal (2.37 mmol/L). Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) dropped from 18.0 μg/L preoperatively to 1.5 μg/L after surgery. No neo-adjuvant or adjuvant radiochemotherapy was given during the primary treatment. He underwent standard follow-up regimen with bloodwork, rectoscopies, ultrasound of the liver and chest x-ray for 4 years without any signs of relapse. CEA values were stable under 2.0 μg/L and only 1.0 μg/L when follow-up was completed.
Ten years after surgery, the patient presented with a tumor in the lower leg. X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging showed a 4.4 cm osteolytic lesion of the fibular head, in addition to a 4.7 cm tumor in the left lung and paratracheal pathological lymph nodes. Biopsies of the fibular head confirmed adenocarcinoma negative for CK7 and positive for CK20, and the pathologist concluded metastasis from the rectal cancer. The histological pattern was similar to the previously resected rectal tumor (Fig. ). CEA had now increased to 15.4 μg/L. He was treated by radiation therapy to the leg (8 Gy × 1) and commenced chemotherapy (fluorouracil, irinotecan, calcium folinate and bevacizumab). His lung pathology stabilized during this treatment and he reported less pain from the leg after the radiation therapy. However, the fibular tumor progressed radiologically and was 7 cm in diameter when it was resected 15 months after discovery. Resection margins were uncertain, and he developed a wound infection with a chronic fistula to the skin.
Three months later, the patient presented with hypercalcemia after being normocalcemic during all previous follow-up. Due to rapidly growing inguinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, he started treatment with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FLOX). CT-scan showed stable disease after three cycles of therapy. Bloodwork revealed that CEA had increased markedly to 380 μg/L. He developed severe hypercalcemia with free ionized calcium reaching 1.81 mmol/L (total calcium 3.33 mmol/L), concurrent with peaks in CEA and PTH levels (Fig. ). Creatinine and estimated GFR was normal, phosphorus was low (0.62 mmol/L), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D was low (24 nmol/L). He had no arrhythmias or other clinical symptoms related to the hypercalcemia. Fluid therapy and zoledronic acid had only short-lasting effect on the calcium levels. PTHrP was negative, but intact PTH was elevated to 54.4 pmol/L (normal range 1.1–7.5 pmol/L). The lab used a standard two-site immunoassay for measurement of the 84 amino acid long PTH, requiring binding in both the N and C terminals for detection. The high PTH led us to consider primary hyperparathyroidism as a differential diagnosis. Ultrasound of the neck and parathyroid scintigraphy with 900 MBq of 99mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) showed no signs of parathyroid adenomas. The diagnostic challenge was to distinguish primary hyperparathyroidism from ectopic PTH production in a colorectal bone metastasis or potentially another tumor.
To investigate if the tumor of the fibular head was responsible for the PTH elevation, we biopsied the tumor and stained for PTH. No significant staining was observed, using monoclonal antibody immunohistochemistry. Because such a large tumor can contain different clones of cells, a negative biopsy does not rule out that PTH could be produced from a part of the tumor not represented in the biopsy. Also, PTH immunohistochemistry on bone biopsies could be false negative for unknown technical reasons. We therefore measured blood PTH levels while excluding the lower right leg from the circulation by use of a blood pressure cuff on the thigh (modified Casanova test [], Fig. a). PTH levels measured in blood samples from the arm fell rapidly during the 20 min of right leg ischemia, consistent with local PTH production from the fibular tumor (Fig. b).
We concluded that the diagnosis was hypercalcemia caused by PTH secretion from the bone metastasis in the fibular head, and focused further treatment against the fibular tumor. The osteoclast inhibitor denosumab 120 mg was administered subcutaneously and further radiotherapy was given to the lower leg (3 Gy × 10). This made free calcium level stabilize at values around 1.40 mmol/L, and PTH was also attenuated (Fig. ). The patient received further cycles with FLIRI/bevacizumab until a year before his death. Six months before the patient died, another surge in PTH and calcium levels arose. Now, the patient received another course of radiotherapy (4 Gy × 5) towards his fibula, followed by a drop in PTH levels and normalization of calcium levels. No adverse events or side effects were reported by the patients or treating clinicians. The patient did not develop further episodes of severe hypercalcemia during the remainder of his life and died approximately 24 months after the first incident of severe hypercalcemia, due to disseminated disease involving skin, lymph nodes, lung, pancreas and brain.
As immunohistochemistry failed to show PTH in the fibular bone metastasis, we analyzed messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) from the same biopsies post mortem. Despite the long interval from biopsy to RNA extraction (5–16 years), we were able to extract total RNA from formalin-fixed paraffine embedded (FFPE) tissue sections and quantified PTH by reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). We found evidence of PTH transcription in both the original rectal specimen and in the fibular biopsy taken after onset of hypercalcemia, but not in the fibular biopsy that was taken before onset of hypercalcemia, nor in ipsilateral inguinal lymph node metastasis (Fig. ). This is consistent with development of clinically significant PTH production within the fibular metastasis, after local recurrence and radiation therapy to the lower leg.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 43-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for acute postprandial abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, without dyspnea and myasthenia. There was no history of trauma. Physical examination found that trachea shifted to the right, breathing sound over the left lower chest decreased, cardiac border shifted to the right and tenderness in the upper abdomen. A chest X-ray showed that mediastinum and trachea shifted to the right and the left diaphragm lifted. Upper digestive tract radiograph (Fig. ) showed left diaphragm elevated, gastric fundus and body lifted with nearly vertical gastroesophageal angle. A diagnosis of organoaxial gastric volvulus was suspected. On CT scan (Fig. ), an irregular mass was found in the anterior mediastinum, about 6.8 × 9.5 cm, left diaphragm was elevated, stomach, spleen, parts of bowels were lifted. Emergency gastroscopy (Fig. ) demonstrated gastric body volvulus. He was treated with endoscopic de-rotation.
The ultrasound guided biopsy of mediastinal mass was performed for this patient. The pathological findings revealed type B3 thymoma. According to the imaging examination he was diagnosed as Masaoka stage III thymoma. The thymoma of this patient presented with extensive pericardium, aorta arch and its branch infiltration, so it was considered as unresectable disease.
The patient with technically unresectable disease received radiotherapy from December 2013. Gastric volvulus still attacked about once a month, with the incentives of cold, satiety or spicy food. Each time endoscopic de-rotation was needed to relieve the symptoms. In 10 months later, CT scan showed the mass in the anterior mediastinum shrank, but a new small lesion developed on the left pleura. CT-guided biopsy of the pleural mass was performed. The histopathology and immunohistochemistry proved thymoma metastasis. The chemotherapy of carboplatin combined with paclitaxel was given for four cycles. He also received radiotherapy on the pleural mass. Disease was stable for 7 months. Gastric volvulus still occurred with less frequency of about every three to four months, and the symptoms were less severe. The left pleural effusion developed in May 2015. The disease was evaluated as progression. Then he received the chemotherapy of ADOC regimen (cisplatin, doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide) for 2 cycles. Till March 2017, he was still alive with slow progression. The gastric volvulus still occurred every 3–4 months.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 67-year-old male presented to the outpatient clinic with a chief complaint of ambulatory difficulty and a history of an ankle fracture and deformity. The patient's daughter reported that her father sustained an ankle fracture 6 weeks ago and was hospitalized. The history revealed that the patient was placed in a short-leg cast and surgery was considered but not performed since the ankle mortise was reduced at that time and the patient's ankle displayed multiple fracture blisters. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility during which time the cast was removed secondary to non-compliance and skin compromise. The patient's daughter stated that her father was fully ambulatory at 2 weeks after the initial injury despite medical advice. Unfortunately, he was unaware of his ankle fracture since he suffered from dementia and Alzheimer's disease. His medical history was also significant for poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, prior alcohol abuse, seizures, aortic stenosis, meningioma, and hypertension. A physical examination revealed a well-nourished individual who was in no acute distress and was alert but not oriented to time, person, or place. His vital signs were stable. The left lower extremity was edematous with a non-infected necrotic wound over the medial malleolus. The ankle and rearfoot displayed severe valgus deformity with the medial malleolus causing pressure necrosis to the overlying soft tissue. He had weakly palpable pulses and loss of protective sensation when examined with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament. Radiographic evaluation revealed a displaced fibula fracture with significant ankle joint subluxation and widening of the medial clear space (). The patient was admitted to the hospital and stratified as moderate risk for surgical intervention after optimized by both internal medicine and cardiology.
Non-invasive vascular studies that consisted of ankle-brachial index, toe-brachial index, and pulse volume recordings demonstrated moderate arterial occlusive disease with a falsely elevated ankle-brachial index secondary to calcified vessels. The patient was then evaluated by vascular surgery and after angiography was performed, adequate collateral circulation was present and their recommendation was to proceed with appropriate surgical intervention. The patient was brought to the operating room after obtaining informed consent from his daughter, as he was deemed not competent to make his own medical decisions. The patient underwent operative intervention that consisted of ORIF of his fibula fracture with placement of multiple pro-syndesmotic screws and application of a multi-plane circular external fixator. Postoperatively, the patient was permitted to fully weight-bear with the external fixator and discharged to a rehabilitation facility. The patient developed a postoperative infection that was evident 3 weeks after surgery, as wound dehiscence and drainage were apparent. The patient was readmitted to the hospital for inpatient care. The patient was brought back to the operating theater during this admission for an incision and drainage of the ankle wound with collection of deep intra-operative soft tissue cultures and reclosure of the wound over a drain. The drain was removed at 72 h and then wet to dry dressings were applied daily until the wound was healed. Deep intra-operative cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The patient was initially placed on parenteral administration of Vancomycin but was switched to oral administration of Zyvox after the first week as the patient continued to remove his peripherally inserted central catheter line. His antibiotic regimen was continued 6 weeks for treatment of deep infection with retained hardware. The patient healed his wound at 6 weeks postoperatively and was full weight-bearing with the external fixator for 12 weeks total time.
The external fixator was removed and the patient was placed into a walking total contact cast for a total of 6 weeks with cast changes performed at 2 week intervals. The patient was able to resume full ambulatory status with prefabricated extra-depth diabetic shoes with soft inlays at 18 weeks postoperatively. The patient continued to maintain an ambulatory status with no further complications at his 8-month follow-up ().","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 56-year-old Caucasian male presented with a sensation of swelling in the throat, hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, and slight soreness in the right side of the throat. The symptoms were present when the patient awoke in the morning and progressed in a few hours, which caused him to seek medical assistance. At the local emergency department, a swollen tongue was found and the on-call otorhinolaryngologist was contacted. The patient had no known food allergies and no previous history of angioedema or urticarial eruptions. The patient did not present any signs of anaphylaxis (e.g., urticarial eruption, pruritus, hypotension, bronchospasm, or vomiting). It was unravelled that the patient 5 years ago was taking an ACE-inhibitor as an antihypertensive drug on a daily basis and thus bradykinin mediated angioedema was suspected. The patient was immediately transferred to the department of otorhinolaryngology. On admission, the symptoms were unchanged and the vital signs were normal. Lung and heart auscultation were normal. The clinical otorhinolaryngological assessment showed a moderate angioedema of the right side of the base of the tongue, the uvula, and the right palate-pharyngeal arch. Fibre-optic assessment of the pharynx showed a moderate swelling of the right side of the lingual tonsil and a severe mucosal swelling of the right side of the hypopharynx, the piriform sinus, the right aryepiglottic fold, and the right ventricular fold. The vocal folds were unaffected. Articulation was slightly impaired by the swelling. The voice was hoarse, but the respiration was unaffected. Besides a single small and sore lymph node on the right side of the neck, there were no palpable cervical lymph nodes. A bedside sonography of the neck revealed an inconspicuous lymph node with normal hilar flow in level Ib/II equivalent to the palpable lymph node. Blood samples (electrolytes, red and white blood cell count, and C-reactive protein) were normal except for a subnormal level of P-potassium 3.0 mmol/L (3.5–4.5 mmol/L). Since there were no signs of an anaphylactic reaction, tryptase was not measured. The patient did not present with symptoms and clinical findings compatible to upper airway infection (no fever, odynophagia, mucosal hyperaemia, or lymphadenitis). The patient had earlier suffered from a single deep vein thrombosis and was known to have type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and secondary polycythaemia due to smoking. He had no positive family history for angioedema and no prior swelling episodes. The medical history did not reveal any signs of allergic disease or malignancy. Complement analysis was not performed in the acute phase, as the biochemical analysis requires several days.
On admission, 40 milligrams of corticosteroid (Solu-Medrol®) had initially been administered intravenously. However, as the history revealed, ACEi-AE was suspected and an effect of corticosteroid could not be expected and was not awaited. Treatment with antihistamine was expected to be ineffective; thus, an antihistamine was not administrated. On suspicion of ACEi-AE, 2000 units of (18 units/kg) plasma-derived C1-inhibitor concentrate (Berinert) was administered intravenously over a course of 10 minutes. The patient rapidly reported to have decreased symptoms, but a fibre-optic reassessment was not performed until 5 hours after the infusion. A significant decrease in severity of the angioedema was observed. The patient was observed in the in-patient department for 24 hours and at discharge the angioedema had completely resolved, which was confirmed by fibre-optic reassessment. At the time of admission, the patient received an ACE-inhibitor, a calcium-antagonist, acetylsalicylic acid, a statin, and a non-beta-cell stimulating antidiabetic drug (Metformin®). The patient was thoroughly instructed never to take ACE-inhibitor again. The patient was enrolled in a large international multicenter DNA sequencing study (Prediction-ADR) in which further evaluation, including DNA testing for genetic mutations in the bradykinin pathway, is currently performed.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 58-year-old male presented with increasing dyspnea following MI. He had thready pulse and blood pressure of 86/34 mmHg on dobutamine and adrenaline infusion at 10 and 0.1/μg/kg/min, respectively. His peripheral oxygen saturation was 88% on high flow oxygen with widespread bilateral lung opacities on chest X-ray. Blood investigations showed hemoglobin 13.5 g/dl, blood urea 142 mg/dl, serum creatinine 2.3 mg/dl, random blood sugar 170 mg/dl, serum sodium 128 meq/1, and serum potassium 5.1 meq/1. Urgent coronary angiography revealed blockade of left anterior descending (LAD) 90%, circumflex 50% and the total occlusion of right coronary artery (RCA). The RCA occlusion was stented successfully during the procedure. The transthoracic echocardiography showed left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) 20% and a large posterior-inferior ventricular septal defect (VSD) with a shunt gradient of 48 mmHg. Mechanical circulatory support was initiated with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and as he was deteriorating rapidly, the decision was taken to perform an urgent operation with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a backup support.
General anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl/propofol in slow titrated dosage, and endotracheal intubation was facilitated with cisatracurium. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was consistent with preoperative TTE finding. Anaesthesia was maintained on propofol and cisatracurium infusion with supplemental midazolam, fentanyl boluses, and sevoflurane. The patient required O2:Air (80:20) to maintain oxygenation with increasing requirement for inotropic and vasoconstrictor support. We decided to go for immediate central cannulation and subsequent cardiopulmonary bypass following anaesthetic induction. Our main aim was to decrease the shunt, prevent hypoxia and to provide an early organ support. The VSD was approximately 3.5 cm in diameter repaired by a bovine pericardial patch, and the friable ventriculotomy was closed using interrupted pledgeted stitches. The coronary artery bypass graft was performed to artery LAD using left internal thoracic artery and venous graft to its diagonal branch. Postoperative TEE showed no residual VSD, and as expected, he was unable to wean from bypass machine. We decided to continue him on central ECMO support to decrease the tension on VSD pericardial patch during immediate postbypass period.
Postoperatively, he required venovenous hemofiltration and the central ECMO switched over to peripheral with femoral cannulation after 72 h. He was eventually weaned from ECMO and IABP support on day 6 and required 43 days stay in cardiac rehabilitation facility and continued to do well following discharge and subsequent follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 20-year-old Hispanic male with no past medical history presented to our institution complaining of generalized weakness for 4 weeks, progressive cough with yellowish sputum, as well as persistent shortness of breath for 3 weeks, and intermittent fever and chills for 3–5 days prior to admission. Family history was remarkable only for coronary artery disease in his father. He denied smoking, alcohol, and using illegal drugs. He had lived with his girlfriend for 2 years and stated to be monogamous over this period. He reported a total of two sexual partners in his life. He was born in Texas and had not traveled outside the US for the last 12 years. Physical examination revealed a cachectic and tachypneic patient in no acute distress with bilateral diffuse crackles and rhonchi. The initial laboratory workup was within normal limits. Computed tomography of the chest () showed diffuse tree-in-bud nodularity, bronchiectasis, and thick-walled cavities in the upper lobes and moderate right simple pleural effusion. The HIV-rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test was reactive. The acid-fast bacilli sputum test was positive, and the patient was started on combination treatment for tuberculosis. The patient improved clinically over the next 3 days. The HIV Western blot test was negative; the viral load was undetectable. The CD4+ and CD8 counts were low (124 and 185, respectively) with a low CD4:CD8 ratio of 0.7. Further workup including immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin G, and immunoglobulin M levels, urine protein electrophoresis, and serum protein electrophoresis was unremarkable. The pleural fluid cytology revealed atypical lymphocytes consistent with the established diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. Further imaging of the abdomen and pelvis showed no abnormalities.
In addition, 8 weeks after discharge the patient was seen in clinic. He was taking his medication to treat tuberculosis and had regular health care follow-up. He was found to be completely asymptomatic with a CD4+ count of 188 cells/mm3. The repeated HIV test was negative, and the viral load was undetectable. After finishing his treatment for tuberculosis, he was evaluated in clinic, had a CD4+ count of 212 cells/mm3, and remained asymptomatic.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"The patient was a Japanese 72-year-old man, who had been diagnosed with atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) in 2014. He was an ex-smoker who did not regularly consume alcohol. In September 2015, treatment with oral cytarabine ocfosfate hydrate was initiated. After four cycles, he developed pneumonia, and treatment was terminated in February 2016. In April 2016, although he had no complaints, his serum C-reactive protein level was found to have re-increased to 4.6 mg/dL, and a chest X-ray and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) revealed scattered small nodular shadows and patchy consolidation (Figure A,B). The radiological findings did not improve despite the administration of antibiotics and antifungal drugs.
We performed bronchoscopy in May 2016. Bronchoalveolar lavage performed in the right upper lobe recovered 90 mL of 150 mL (60%) with 1.3 × 105/mL cells (neutrophils: 26%, lymphocytes: 36%, eosinophils: 1%, and macrophages: 37%). The histological examination of a specimen obtained from the right upper lobe via transbronchial lung biopsy revealed findings consistent with OP (Figure A). On immunofluorescence testing, the patient's antinuclear antibody titer was <40, and no other autoantibodies, including anti-SS-A, anti-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase antibody, rheumatoid factor, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, were detected. We diagnosed the patient with secondary OP associated with aCML. Treatment with prednisolone (30 mg, daily) was initiated, which resulted in the improvement of the laboratory and radiological findings, and the dose of prednisolone was then gradually tapered (Figure ). In September 2016, the patient developed general fatigue while under treatment with prednisolone (17.5 mg, daily). Chest CT revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities (GGOs). We considered the possibility of a recurrence of OP, and therefore increased the dose of prednisolone to 30 mg, daily; however, the patient's condition did not improve.
The patient was admitted to our hospital due to dyspnea on effort in November 2016. On admission, a physical examination revealed the following findings: respiratory rate, 15 breaths per minute; heart rate, 80 beats per minute; blood pressure, 106/60 mm Hg; and body temperature, 37.3°C. Chest auscultation revealed no abnormalities.
The laboratory tests performed on admission included an arterial blood gas analysis under ambient air, which showed the following findings: partial pressure of oxygen, 60.3 Torr; partial pressure of carbon dioxide, 30.4 Torr; and pH, 7.446. A blood analysis revealed the following findings: white blood cell count, 41 900/μL (neutrophil, 88.0%; lymphocytes, 5.0%; monocytes, 2.0%; promyelocytes, 1.0%; and myelocytes, 3.0%; metacytes, 1.0%); hemoglobin, 7.8 g/dL; platelet count, 34.2 × 104/μL; lactate dehydrogenase, 564 IU/L, Krebs von den Lugen-6, 2826 U/mL; and carcinoembryonic antigen, 15.6 ng/mL. The patient was negative for β-D glucan and cytomegalovirus antigen. HRCT showed diffuse GGOs in both lung fields (Figure C,D).
On the following day, we performed bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage in the right middle lobe. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed a light milky appearance (Figure B) and was periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive. Transbronchial lung biopsy revealed the precipitation of dense, homogenous, eosinophilic material, which had a fine granular appearance, and which filled the alveoli (Figure C); however, no evidence of OP was found. Based on these findings, he was diagnosed with PAP. Although the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor autoantibody level was not measured, the diagnosis of sPAP was confirmed by compatible radiological findings and a pre-existing diagnosis of aCML.,
He gradually developed respiratory failure with the progression of PAP; whole-lung lavage was subsequently performed. Unfortunately, the patient died of acute enteritis within 1 month of whole-lung lavage.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 55-year-old woman reported a 24-hour history of unusual pain in her left carotid area irradiating to the ear. Colour Doppler ultrasound revealed an eccentric hypoechoic thickening (black arrows on Figure ) of the proximal bulbar internal carotid but also partially of the carotid bifurcation itself. A thin hyperechoic atheromatous fibrous plaque was also visible (small white arrows on Figure ) but no significant stenosis was found. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound showed normal capillary distribution of micro bubbles in the hypo echoic thickening, therefore excluding haematoma (Figure , black arrows). The avascular fibrous plaque was well demonstrated (small black arrows). Unenhanced Axial T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging showed an hypo intense tissue (Figure , black arrows) around the proximal internal carotid. Intense enhancement of this tissue was shown on fat-saturated contrast enhanced T1-weighted images (Figure ). Carotidynia or TIPIC syndrome was diagnosed and the woman was immediately treated with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. Doppler ultrasound performed after 14 days already showed rapid regression of both the symptoms and the perivascular inflammatory sheath (black arrows on Figure ).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"On March 10, 2020, a 50-year-old man, positive for SARS-CoV-2, was admitted to Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital (Wuhan, China) after 47 days of cough and fever (). On February 15, nucleic acid results for SARS-CoV-2 were positive. Previous treatments included arbidol (0.2 g, thrice daily) and lianhua qingwen granules (6 g, thrice daily). On admission, peripheral oxygen saturation was 96% in ambient air and respiratory rate was 18 breaths/minute. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels for SARS-CoV-2 were, respectively, 53.12 g/L and 173.69 g/L (normal range for both: <10 g/L; Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China). Computed tomography (CT) findings showed a bilateral, scattered, high-density shadow and fiber- and spine-like opacities. From March 10 to 22, convalescent plasma from COVID-19 patients (200 mL, March 17 and 18), recombinant human interferon (0.3 mL, atomized inhalation, once daily), lianhua qingwen granules (6 g, thrice daily), and arbidol (2 tablets, thrice daily) were administered as treatment; on March 23, chloroquine phosphate (2 tablets, twice daily) was administered instead of arbidol. On March 23, SARS-CoV-2 RNA were positive. A CT scan showed substantial improvement, with no obvious pulmonary lesions, on March 24. He was treated with ritonavir-boosted danoprevir (DNVr) alone (100/100 mg, one tablet twice daily). From April 3 to 5, nucleic acid test results for SARS-CoV-2 were all negative. SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG levels were markedly reduced (5.38 g/L and 108.68 g/L, respectively). On April 7, he was discharged from the hospital after three consecutively negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The duration from positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA to three consecutive negative results was 55 days.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"The patient is a 44-year-old female, with a medical history of migraines, mild arterial hypertension, and a left vertebral artery dissection in 2014, without brain infarction (Figures and ). She was using losartan and aspirin daily. The patient suffers from recurrent headaches related to the first 3 days of her menstruation cycle. Her 75-year-old mother was diagnosed with a thoracic aortic aneurysm 10 years previously.
In September 2016, she presented with oppressive headache with left predominance, photophobia and nausea, lasting for 6 days. The intensity of the pain was 8 out of 10 on a visual analog scale (VAS). She also complained of cervical discomfort. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed left internal carotid artery dissection extended between the upper cervical and supraclinoid segments (Figures and ). No ischemic brain damage was observed. Therefore, she was admitted to the emergency department, and aspirin orally was administered in doses of 250 mg at bed time. There were no focal neurological signs on physical examination. The patient had good spatial–temporal orientation and was afebrile.
We attributed the headache to both the left internal carotid artery dissection and the migraine. There was an insufficient response to a combination of ketoprofen and metamizole i.v. Thus, intravenous betamethasone was added to the treatment regimen to provide a rescue medication for the refractory pain. However, the patient showed only a partial response after a 3-day course. She was then prescribed oral topiramate 50 mg two times a day as preventive therapy and naproxen sodium 550 mg as acute treatment option.
One week later, a new CTA was performed and showed no changes compared to the previous imaging.
Apart from hypertension and migraine, we did not identify other putative risk factors for dissections of extracranial arteries such as recent respiratory tract infection and hyperhomocysteinemia. There was no history of major or minor cervical trauma, chiropractic maneuver, or hyperextension injury. Infectious-inflammatory pathology of the paranasal sinuses was excluded with a computed tomography. The patient did not have signs of either hypermobility or dermic lesions. A dermatologist ruled out connective tissue disorders. Renal fibromuscular dysplasia was ruled out using non-invasive imaging duplex ultrasound. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed no abnormalities such as congenital heart defects and left ventricular outflow tract malformations. A computed tomographic scanning and aortography ruled out aortic aneurysm.
To determine the possible nature of this recurrent dissection, an aortopathy comprehensive panel was ordered with sequence analysis and exonic deletion/duplication testing of 25 genes (ACTA2, CBS, COL3A1, COL5A1, COL5A2, EFEMP2, FBN1, FBN2, FLNA; MAT2A, MED12, MYH12, MYH11, MYLK, NOTCH1, PLOD1, PRKG1, SKI, SLCA10, SMAD3, SMAD4, SMAD6, TGFB2, TGFB3, TGBR1, TGFBR2). This test is a comprehensive analysis of genes associated with inherited aortopathy and connective tissue disorders. We ordered it because of the antecedent of maternal thoracic aortic aneurysm (INVITAE, San Francisco, CA, USA; ).
A heterozygous variant was identified in the NOTCH 1 gene (exon 34, c.6365C>T). This sequence replaces proline with leucine at codon 2122 of the NOTCH 1 protein (p.Pro2122Leu). Her mother was also tested, and she was positive for this variant in heterozygous state.
The patient was discharged without focal neurologic deficit with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 0 (0–42). After 6 months, she was on aspirin 100 mg and topiramate 100 mg per day, remained with NIHSS 0 and was able to return to normal activities. There was a reduction in the headache days to about 1 day/month and in the headache severity (VAS = 2).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 6-year-old boy presented with noneruption of teeth. His parents seemed to be normal and they denied any history of similar condition in their respective families. The parents revealed that the child was progressing at an average pace in school. The child had sparse, fine, blond hair, especially at the temple area and eyebrows. The lower facial height decreased due to an over closed profile, making the lips appear prominent. Examination of nails revealed no abnormality. His behavior in the dental office was age appropriate. An intraoral examination revealed complete anodontia in the mandibular arch and alveolar ridges appeared considerably shallow []. Hypodontia was observed in the maxillary arch with only maxillary left deciduous first molar and bilateral deciduous second molars present. Buccal mucosa, palate, and floor of the mouth were normal. Vertical dimension was considerably lost. Radiographic evaluation revealed that the tooth germs of only 11 and 21 were present in the maxillary arch and there were no evident tooth germs of deciduous and permanent teeth in the mandibular arch []. His nails were normal []. Child was referred to the Department of Pediatrics for assessment. A diagnosis of nonsyndromic oligodontia and anodontia was made. Family pedigree was not studied.
Oral rehabilitation, with removable prosthesis, mandibular complete denture, and maxillary removable partial dentures, was planned with frequent follow-up and multiple prosthesis to accommodate age changes. The first visit was purely introductory. The parents were explained the plan of treatment. The procedure of denture fabrication closely paralleled that for the conventional denture technique but with a few notable exceptions. Initial impressions were made in modeling compound (DPI Pinnacle, Mumbai, India). Custom acrylic resin trays were fabricated from the resultant casts. A wax spacer was adapted over the nonstress bearing areas. The maxillary and mandibular trays verified for accuracy and were border-molded with green stick compound (DPI Pinnacle Tracing Sticks, Mumbai, India). The final wash impressions were obtained with zinc oxide eugenol (DPI Impression Paste, Mumbai, India). Temporary record bases were fabricated using cold cure acrylic resin followed by wax occlusion rims over them. The pattern denture base was verified intraorally for accuracy and jaw relations were recorded. The mandibular rest position was estimated extraorally, and the upper lip was used as a guide for the location of the incisal edges of the upper anterior teeth. The orientation of occlusal plane was kept lower than the level of the mandibular foramen unlike the occlusal plane in the adult patient. Teeth arrangement was done following conventional technique. No attempt was made to balance the occlusion. During the try-in appointment, it was observed that the part of incisal edge of the maxillary right permanent central incisor had erupted above the gingival margin and was interfering with the retention of the maxillary temporary denture base, as it had not pierced through the gingiva till the secondary impression was made. A window was created just palatal to maxillary right deciduous incisors and canine to accommodate the erupting permanent tooth []. Furthermore, the right maxillary anterior had to be placed more labially for the same reason. Try-in was done and the child's joy to see his artificial teeth was very obvious. Dentures were processed with heat-cured acrylic resin following compression molding technique and polished. The maxillary removable partial denture retention was assisted with clasps on deciduous second molars. At the insertion appointment, the complete incisal edge of the maxillary permanent right central incisor had erupted in the oral cavity, so further widening of the window created to accommodate the erupting tooth was done. The maxillary partial and mandibular complete dentures were inserted [Figures and ]. Instructions about oral hygiene were given, and the parents were asked to supervise the child's oral hygiene. The patient was advised to maintain a soft diet for the first few days and to remove the dentures at night and during the sports activities. Recall appointments were scheduled for 24 h and then weekly.
The parents reported no problem in retention of the prosthesis. Initially, the patient had some difficulty in accepting the dentures and was unable to keep them in the mouth for long periods. However, shortly, he was fully adjusted to using the dentures. Patient was on a monthly recall schedule for continuous monitoring to track the eruption of 11 and observe the status of 21 and to allow the necessary adjustments of his denture to accommodate the erupting permanent tooth/teeth. The maxillary permanent right central incisor erupted completely through the window in the prosthesis. After 2 years, the patient reported difficulty in wearing the dentures. The dentures were replaced with the new prosthesis following the technique as earlier accommodating the erupted permanent right incisor and the growth changes in the jaws []. No change in the status of the unerupted 21 was observed.
At the beginning of therapy, the patient was quiet and withdrawn. He became communicative and his speech skills improved after the insertion of dentures. Development of a good psychological self-image was achieved through the esthetic improvement. Facial profile and expression improved with the prosthesis. The cosmetic effect alone seemed to transform the patient into a socially acceptable individual. Future treatment will include relining, rebasing, or remaking of the dentures to accommodate growth and development and definitive restorations at an appropriate age.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 49-year-old right-handed AA woman with a past medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, schizoaffective, and conversion disorder presented to the UAB emergency room for evaluation of altered mental status after a witnessed seizure. There was no travel or contact exposure to COVID-19, and she had no symptoms of COVID-19. At presentation, she had an axillary temperature of 99.5F, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, heart rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 180/95 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The neurologic exam revealed lethargy and disorientation to time and place. There was no meningismus. CT head was normal. Continuous video EEG monitoring was obtained to rule out subclinical seizures and status epilepticus. Scalp EEG showed severe background slowing in the delta range and the presence of multiple seizures (approx. 4-6 every hour over the next 8 hours) emanating from the midline and left fronto-central regions (Figs. , ). Initially, there was a clinical correlate of facial twitching, head version to the right followed by a bilateral tonic–clonic seizure. In the latter half, there was electroclinical dissociation with the presence of only electrographic seizures. The patient was intubated and treated with multiple doses of lorazepam, levetiracetam, and propofol for sedation. Soon after arrival, the patient was tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) through a nasal swab specimen, which returned negative. MRI brain without contrast was unrevealing for any definitive pathology. Her clinical course over the next 36 hours improved significantly with resolution in status epilepticus, and she was extubated within 48 hours. A lumbar puncture was not performed due to rapid improvement, and excellent response to levetiracetam. However, within 72 hours of the initial presentation, the patient developed fever, shortness of breath, myalgias, and nonproductive cough. A repeat nasal swab RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 returned positive.

"An 80-year-old Japanese man hospitalized due to acute exacerbation stemming from asthma and COPD overlap presented with left-side pneumothorax caused by respiratory tract infection. Subsequently, a chest drain tube was inserted; however, a tumor suspicious for lung cancer was present at the entrance of the left upper lobe bronchus. The lung could not be sufficiently expanded, and an air leak was present. We performed pleurodesis twice (first: 200 mL of autologous blood and 4 g of talc; second: 200 mL of autologous blood), but the air leak persisted. Since surgical treatments were considered high risk for this patient due to poor lung function, we decided to treat by bronchial occlusion with EWS. Under bronchoscopy, a tumor was observed with a smooth surface at the entrance of the upper left lobe (Fig. ). A balloon occlusion test was performed using a balloon catheter (Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA) with a diameter of 4 Fr and an inflated balloon diameter of 9 mm, to determine the affected bronchi. After the entire left lower lobe bronchus was occluded by the balloon, the air leak ceased. Subsequently, bronchography was performed to identify the affected bronchi at the subsegmental bronchial level. The catheter was inserted into the subsegmental bronchus, and a contrast medium (iopamidol 5 mL and saline 15 mL) was injected from the tip. The contrast medium was injected from the left B8a and left B8b bronchi (Fig. ). Fluoroscopy confirmed contrast leakage from the left B8b bronchus into the thoracic cavity, and we suspected major leakage at the bronchi leading from the left B8b and the left B6 bronchi (Fig. ). We then successfully inserted a medium-sized EWS into the left B8b bronchus. Subsequently, we attempted to insert a large-sized EWS into the left B6 bronchus, but the fitting was difficult. Thus, we cut the end of the EWS to size and inserted it into the left B6a bronchus. After EWS insertions, the air leak clearly decreased. Finally, occluding the left B6 and left B8 bronchi by balloon catheter, we confirmed a slight but further decrease in air leakage. Therefore, we judged the remaining air leak to be minor. After bronchial occlusion, we performed pleurodesis twice (first: Picibanil (OK-432) 5 KE; Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan, minocycline 300 mg; second: 50% glucose solution and 120 mL of autologous blood), and the air leak ceased completely. The chest drain tube was successfully removed. Several days later, he was diagnosed with pyothorax. The empyema cavity was confined to a small area, and it was difficult to puncture. Therefore, we treated with antibiotics (tazobactam-piperacillin 4.5 g 4 times a day). After 4 weeks of antibiotics therapy, he was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 49-year-old male presented with a history of bomb blast injury to his left elbow 25 years back, when he had sustained an open and comminuted fracture of left distal humerus with extension into the elbow joint. The injury was treated with wound debridement and cast application for 6 weeks. Distal humerus progressed to atrophic non-union, with severe deformity and stiffness of the elbow. He also had partial involvement of radial and ulnar nerves with stiffness and deformities of the fingers of the left hand. He presented to us for correction of the elbow deformity and to gain reasonable elbow and hand function.
On local examination, there were multiple scars present medially, laterally and posteriorly around his left elbow suggestive of healed wounds by secondary intention after compound injury. There was fixed flexion deformity of the elbow of 900 with further flexion up to 120 degree was possible (, ). There was partial sensory loss in the little and ring fingers and the muscle power (as per MRC grading) of the finger flexors was 3/5; wrist and those of elbow flexors was 2/5. The motor power of left fingers, wrist and elbow extensors were 1/5.
Plain radiographs revealed atrophic non-union of the supracondylar fracture along with the deformity at the distal humerus due to malunited distal humeral fracture (, ). CT scan confirmed these radiographic findings and demonstrated a significant gap at the fracture site with grossly rotated distal humeral condylar fragments and marked disuse osteopenia.
In view of grossly distorted anatomy of the distal humerus, poor bone stock, bone gap at the non-united fracture, severe elbow deformity and stiffness we preferred to go for a mega prosthetic replacement of the left elbow. Under general anaesthesia, elbow was approached posteriorly by ’Wadsworth approach’ and the fracture site was exposed. Severe fibrosis was encountered between the fractured ends of the bone, which was excised. The distal humeral condylar fragments were found to be grossly mal-positioned, osteoporosed, destructed and were not amenable to osteosynthesis or conventional total elbow replacement. Hence, the distal humeral bone fragments were excised, leading to a large bone gap at the elbow. This gap was reconstructed by using elbow mega prosthesis. Preparation for mega prosthetic replacement was done by reaming the humeral and ulnar shafts. Cemented titanium prosthesis (XLO Tm) was used for reconstruction, with ulnar stem of 132 mm and humeral stem of 175 mm length. The implant had eyes in the ulnar component for the attachment of the triceps tendon. Common flexor tendons were attached on the medial side and the common extensor tendons were attached on lateral side of triceps tendon and finally the combined tendinous complex was attached at the eye of the prosthesis with the help of non-absorbable polyester suture (Ethibond™ No. 5). Intra operatively, we could achieve good correction of the elbow deformity (with ROM of 10-1500) with stable elbow joint.
The patient was given i.v. third generation cephalosporin and aminoglycoside for a period of three days post operatively. The antibiotics were shifted to oral at the time of discharge and were continued for a period of two weeks till suture removal. The limb was kept in a splint for 2 weeks followed by physical therapy to regain the movements and function of the elbow and hand (, ). The post-operative recovery was satisfactory and uneventful. Post-operative X-ray showed good placement of the prosthesis with adequate cementation (, ).
At 12 months follow up, the the patient had significant improvement in the post-operative Mayo elbow score of 80 compared to pre-operative score of only 50. The patient could now do many of his activities of daily living with left hand, which were not possible before, apart from significant improvement in the cosmetic appearance.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 20-year-old female patient visited the clinic due to eczematous lesions on the posterior neck, flexure area of the elbow, and popliteal area with known atopic dermatitis. She also suffered from atopic dermatitis from infancy. She received a standard treatment also without effectiveness, showing persistent fluctuation. Her clinical severity scores were improved from 32.9 to 5 after 24 Histobulin injections. The laboratory test results and skin test results before and after treatment are shown in Figure . The MAST results showed that 7 allergens were positive (Dp 100<, Df 100<, shrimp 0.61, Cladosporum hertiarum 1.34, A fumigatus 2.65, A alternata 1.88, and mugwort 4.41) before treatment and 12 allergens were positive (Dp 100<, Df 100<, crab 0.41, shrimp 0., C herbarum 8.89, A fumigatus 5.10, Alternaria alternata 14.19, mugwort 1.13, P notatum 44.23, oxeye daisy 0.74, dandelion 0.57, and goldenrod 0.62) after treatment. In the skin test, 10 allergens (Dp 4+, Df 4+, grey Alder with silver birch 2+, mugwort 4+, short ragweed 2+, black willow pollen 2+, Japanese cedar 2+, milk mix 2+, almond 2+, and peanut 2+) showed a positive reaction before treatment and 7 allergens (C albicans 2+, Dp 4+, Df 4+, mugwort 4+, black willow pollen 3+, Japanese cedar 1+, and peanut 2+) after treatment.

"In 1998, a radical nephrectomy was performed on a 79-year-old man with an intent to cure nonmetastatic grade 2 RCC. Histology-proven metastatic progression was diagnosed in 2006, with a painful 50×50 mm lytic lesion of the left scapula. A palliative radiotherapy was successfully performed (39 Gy, 3 Gy/fraction) with significant pain relief. Because of the patient’s age, bevacizumab was initiated in monotherapy at a third of the recommended dose (ie, 5 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks instead of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). The patient was 88 years old at that time but was still in excellent condition. Bevacizumab could be continued for another 5 years with a perfect tolerance and good efficacy: Scapula metastasis was stable (43×38 mm) and painless. Bevacizumab was stopped in 2011, considering the extended absence of cancer progression. Six months later, an isolated progression of the scapula lesion was reported, with an increasing left shoulder pain and an increasing metastasis volume (50×60 mm). Bevacizumab was readministered in 2012 with a pain resolution, and tumor volume decreased in 9 weeks. To date, the patient is still alive with an excellent tolerance. Intermittent (“start-and-stop”) bevacizumab is continued with a clear on/off effect on pain relief.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 69-year-old man was seen at our Dermatology Department with complaints of blistering disease on his right leg. The complaints had started 2 to 3 weeks after knee replacement surgery on the right knee. First, small vesicles had appeared on his knee. These, however, continued to multiply and became larger in the following weeks. The blisters progressed and after few weeks resulted in large erosions that were resistant to treatment with local corticosteroids.
Skin biopsies, direct (DIF) and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), and salt-split skin results were all consistent with BP. Except for the right leg, there was no other skin or mucous membrane involvement.
Six months after the surgery, complaints gradually disappeared. No relapse appeared in the following year. The patient had no change in systemic medication in this period as a possible explanation of this cure. Because of the atypical course of his disease and at his specific insistence, he was referred for patch tests.
Patch tests were performed on the upper back with the European baseline series, a local extension of the baseline series, an acrylate series, and a metal series. Allergens were tested using van der Bend test chambers (Brielle, the Netherlands) applied on the upper back and covered with Fixomull stretch (BSN Medical, Hamburg, Germany). Readings were performed on day (D) 2, D4, and D7 according ESCD criteria. Tests were positive for 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate 2.0% pet. (D2: ?+, D4: +, D7: +), methyl methacrylate 2.0% pet. (D2: ?+, D4: +, D7: +), ethylene glycol dimethacrylate 2.0% pet. (D2: -, D4: +, D7: +), triethylene glycol dimethacrylate 2.0% pet. (D2: ?+, D4: +, D7: ?+), and tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate 2.0% pet. (D2: ?+, D4: ?+, D7: +).
Contact sensitization to several methacrylates was regarded as being of probable clinical relevance for the complaints of the patient. Prior to the knee replacement procedure, the patient had no contact with methacrylates as far as could be determined that could have caused sensitization.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"The second patient was a 61-year-old male heavy smoker who reported a cough and sputum with blood for over 10 days. A chest CT revealed a mass (5.5×4 cm) in his left upper lung lobe. The patient underwent a left total pneumonectomy. His pathological diagnosis was SCLC, and his specimen stained positive for CD56, neuron-specific enolase, and carcinoembryonic antigen, and negative for chromogranin A and synaptophysin. His pathological TNM stage was T2bN1M0 (IIB). He received six cycles of chemotherapy (etoposide and cisplatin), thoracic radiotherapy, and prophylactic cranial irradiation.

"The patient was a thirty-year old clerk. She complained of an abnormal warm sensation in her left breast. She consulted her doctors regarding this problem, but was reassured that it was normal. Sixteen months later she noted a definite lump in her left breast, and an excision biopsy was done. The lump recurred two months later, and a similar procedure was performed. Both biopsies were reported as benign haemangiomas. The lesion recurred during the next two months and, this time, she approached our clinic. Physical examination revealed a mass which measured approximately 6 cm. She was advised mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction. She refused, but one month later, returned to our hospital with a haemorrhaging lesion in the left breast (). She was found to be pale, but was haemodynamically stable. She underwent radiological embolisation of the lesion. The angiogram showed a tumour blush that had feeding arteries from branches of the left internal mammary artery and lateral thoracic artery. Embolisation of the feeding vessels was done using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Post-embolisation images showed complete occlusion of these feeding vessels (). She later consented for mastectomy. The tumour was completely excised and was reported as a grade 2 angiosarcoma. Radiotherapy of the chest wall was given, and investigations showed multiple lung metastases and bone metastases. She, however, refused palliative chemotherapy. Five months after mastectomy, she returned with right hypochondrium pain and abdominal distension. On clinical examination, she was pale. Her haemoglobin was 6 g/dl with a platelet count of 83 x 109/L. The low platelet count could be attributed to continuing platelet consumption due to formation of thrombi in the vascular metastatic lesions. Her abdomen was found to be grossly distended, tense, and tender. The fluid thrill test was positive. CT scan of the abdomen revealed multiple liver metastases with free fluid in the peritoneal cavity. The main hepatic artery was successfully embolised. Palliation of symptoms was achieved with analgesics, repeated peritoneal tapping, and blood transfusions. The patient also developed minor local recurrence on the chest wall, which fortunately did not bleed. Seven months after treatment and 28 months after initial excision biopsy, she deteriorated rapidly and passed away.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"The patient was a 40-year-old man who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria for schizophrenia. Onset of schizophrenia occurred in his early twenties. The typical antipsychotic drug haloperidol was administered for some time. After he stopped the medication (haloperidol 2 mg) because of tremor, he jumped from a second floor window due to delusions and hallucinations. He was then admitted to the hospital's emergency medical center with a right calcaneal fracture. His right leg joint was fixed in a plastic cast, and he was admitted. Treatment with blonanserin (8 mg) and flunitrazepam (2 mg, at night) was initiated for auditory hallucination. At 1 week later, the blonanserin was increased to 16 mg because his persecutory delusions and auditory hallucinations persisted. After the increase in dose (16 mg), the patient complained of leg restlessness. His global score on the Barnes Akathisia Scale [] was 3 ('moderate akathisia'). Substantial relief of akathisia was noted on the next day of fluvoxamine (50 mg) treatment, at which point his global score on the Barnes Akathisia Scale was 0. At 1 week later, the dose of blonanserin was increased to 24 mg since he still had psychotic symptoms. Fluvoxamine (50 mg) continued to be administered. He had no recurrence of the akathisia. After 1 month, he was discharged home because his psychotic symptoms were improved.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 35-year-old mentally disabled woman with a psychiatric history of obsessive behavior in childhood and anxiety disorder consulted the dermatology department for generalized pruritus. She was diagnosed with atopic dermatitis which resolved after corticoid-based therapy. In 2005, she was referred to our department because of laterocervical lymphadenopathies and night fever with intense sweating. Body computed tomography (CT) showed supra- and infra-diaphragmatic lymphadenopathies with various abdominal masses, the most relevant being 8×6×8 cm3. A biopsy of a lymphadenopathy revealed NS classic HL. With a final diagnosis of NS HL stage IIIB with an International Prognostic Score 2, she received six cycles of ABVD chemotherapy regimen with partial response and an early relapse in March 2006 (primary refractory to ABVD). This was followed by a salvage chemotherapy regimen (two cycles of ESHAP) with no response. In September 2006, a third chemotherapy regimen (four cycles of GemOx) was initiated with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia grade 4, which led to dose-intensity failures followed by chemotherapy discontinuation and radiotherapy consolidation. One month after the last radiotherapy session, the HL progressed; so, two cycles of IFE regimen were given with stable disease. Considering the basal comorbidities of the patient, we decided to pursue a watch-and-wait policy from 2008 to 2010, treating localized areas of progression with radiotherapy and obtaining transient partial responses (). In October 2010, a new mass appeared in D8–D9, presenting with a medullar compression syndrome. After a biopsy that confirmed HL relapse, it was treated with radiotherapy and six cycles of GemOx, which led to a partial response. However, a new progression occurred in the left cervical and axillary nodes within 1 month, which was observed with a watch-and-wait policy with the consent of the family.
In May 2012, our patient presented a new clinically symptomatic disease progression confirmed by positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, requiring bendamustine 90 mg/m2 and finally reaching disease stability. In August 2014, the HL progressed again with significant B symptoms and worsening clinical status (). At this point, based on our experience of the potential role of COX-2 expression in HL, and that the patient was not a candidate for intensive chemotherapy and brentuximab was still not available in our center, we decided to start an experimental treatment with celecoxib 200 mg every 12 hours and lenalidomide 20 mg (for 3 of every 4 weeks). This regimen was obtained through a compassionate use request. Our patient received this treatment from August 2014 to January 2015 (six cycles) with unremarkable toxicity and excellent tolerance, finally showing a CR for the first time in both the interim after three cycles and the final CT/PET after six cycles (). This response was maintained in a new CT scan in August 2015. After this induction, we started 1 year of celecoxib maintenance (200 mg/12 hours) that had to be stopped because of anemia due to gastrointestinal bleeding in March 2016.
In July 2016, with the most durable response until that moment being 22 months, our patient presented a new disease relapse. CT/PET showed supra- and infra-abdominal adenopathies with associated hepatic and splenic lesions. As two different biopsies of hypermetabolic locations resulted negative and keeping in mind the asymptomatic situation of our patient, we decided to restart celecoxib 200 mg every 12 hours. In this context, the disease progressed to ascites requiring paracentesis. Biopsies were constantly negative until February 2017, when a final biopsy confirmed the persistence of HL. At that point, we decided to start brentuximab vedotin (two cycles). During the second cycle of brentuximab, the patient required intensive care admission due to a sepsis with a fatal outcome.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 79-year-old Caucasian man presented to the clinic with reduced appetite, unintentional weight loss of approximately 6 kg, and a history of fatty food intolerance. He denied any abdominal pain or febrile episodes, and physical examination was unremarkable. Biochemical investigations, however, revealed deranged liver-function tests with total bilirubin, 66 μmol/L; ALT, 122IU/L; ALP, 274IU/L; and gamma GT, 864IU/L.
An abdominal ultrasound showed a dilated common bile duct (CBD) with stones inside it. The gallbladder was not visualized, but strong echoes with acoustic shadowing were seen, suggesting a contracted gallbladder. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed stenosis of the proximal CBD and dilated intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts. Furthermore, it showed a small pseudocystic structure that was assumed to be a shrunken gallbladder.
The patient proceeded to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which showed multiple stones (the largest measuring 1.5 cm) in the CBD, which could not be removed, and so a stent was inserted (see Figure ). The gallbladder was not visualized, but this was thought to be the result of insufficient contrast. A repeated ERCP a few months later was reported as having cleared the CBD of all stones; the stent was removed, but the gallbladder had still not been visualized. As he had developed some intermittent right upper quadrant pain over this time, he was listed for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for presumed choledocholithiasis.
At laparoscopy, a small fibrous remnant was seen in the gallbladder fossa, but the gallbladder could not be found despite an extensive search of all possible ectopic sites. Conversion to an open procedure and on-table cholangiogram revealed a dilated CBD and confirmed gallbladder agenesis (see Figure ). The CBD was explored, numerous stones removed, and a T-tube was inserted.
Post-operatively, he made an uneventful recovery, and remains symptom free.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"The 37-year-old woman presented with a three-month history of continuous pain in the right shoulder and chest. She was taken to our department of cardiothoracic surgery. Physical examination was remarkable for palpable lymph nodes in the bilateral supraclavicular fossae. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed an oval mass located in the anterior mediastinum. Circumambient lung tissue was involved. Haematological findings were: WBC 15.40 × 109/L, platelets 364 × 109/L, prothrombin time 10.3 sec. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), blood biochemistry, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, urine analysis and the endocrine profile were within normal range except hemoglobin (106 g/L) and tumor specific growth factor (67 U/ML). The abdominal ultrasonography did not reveal any other abnormality.
The surgery was performed with the patient under general anesthesia and left lateral decubitus position. The procedure revealed an oval tumor, volume of which was 7 cm × 4.5 cm × 2.5 cm, in the anterior mediastinum and circumambient lung tissue was involved. Pathologic findings during surgery showed that the tumor was off-white with obscure boundaries and hard in consistence (Figure ). The result of pathology hinted that the tumor maybe malignant lymphoma. The tumor and circumambient lung tissue which was involved were excised.
Histology showed the tumor was nodular and different nodules were separated by collagen fibers (Figure ). There were two morphologically and immunophenotypically distinct components. The great mass of nodules showed a pleomorphic cellular infiltrate containing lymphocyte, eosinophile granulocyte, neutrophile granulocyte and numerous large Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg cells. The Reed-Sternberg cells were positive for CD30, CD15 and MUM1 but negative for CD20, CD79a, CD3, Pax-5, CD68, bcl-6, CD10, CD45, Igκ, Igλ and epithelial membrane antigen (Figure , Figure ). Other nodules displayed sheets of relatively uniform large lymphoid cells with typical morphologic features of large cell lymphoma which showed uniform expression of CD20, CD79a, MUM1, CD45, Igλ, Pax-5 and absence of CD30, CD15, CD3, CD10, bcl-6, Igκ, CD68 and epithelial membrane antigen (Figure , Figure ). All the primary antibodies are listed in Table . Neither cell population showed makers of EBV infection by EBER in situ hybridization (PanPath Company, Amsterdam, Netherlands). On the basis of histomorphology at light microscopy, the presence of immunohistochemical staining and in situ hybridization, a diagnosis of CL, combination of NSHL and DLBCL, in the anterior mediastinum was made. The patient received six courses of CHOP chemotherapy (a course of treatment every two weeks) and twenty three times radiotherapy (Gross Tumor Volume, GTV = 40Gy/20f; Planning Target Volume, PTV = 36 Gy/20f). After treatment, lymph nodes in the bilateral supraclavicular fossa disappeared. The total follow-up period was thirty three months after surgery. The repeated CT scans, abdominal ultrasonography and tumor specific growth factor every three months revealed no recurring or residual lesion.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"The 48-year-old woman unintentionally felt a painless mass of about 2 cm × 1 cm in the upper outer quadrant of her left breast in March 2017, which gradually enlarged due to her neglect. In September 2017, the mass rapidly enlarged to 7cm × 6 cm, and there was infiltrated erythema and ulceration on the skin of the breast. In October 2017, she was admitted to our hospital and received mammary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (), which showed a 91 mm × 55 mm × 87 mm mass with ill-defined margins and a heterogeneous internal enhancement in the left breast; breast imaging reporting and data system (BI-RADS) category was identified as 5. Additionally, enlarged lymph nodes in her left axilla were observed. Laboratory examinations presented normal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level (0.926 ng/ml) and high cancer antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) level (61.4 U/ml). Subsequently, core needle biopsy was performed on October 28, 2017, and invasive ductal carcinoma was pathologically diagnosed, histological grade 2, with estrogen receptor (ER) negative and progesterone receptor (PR) negative, overexpression of HER-2 (+++), and high proliferation index Ki-67 (70%) (). The patient was in good health without any medical history of hypertension or diabetes and without smoking, drinking, and other bad habits. She had menarche at 13 years old, and the last menstrual period was October 11, 2017. Before any treatment, we offered a thorough examination and excluded any distant metastases. The clinical stage was cT4N2aM0 according to the 7th edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual ().
As pertuzumab and T-DM1 had not been approved in China at that time, after obtaining informed consent, we adopted a TCbH regimen (docetaxel, 75 mg/m2 d1; carboplatin, AUC = 6 d1; trastuzumab, 8 mg/kg for the first cycle and 6 mg/kg thereafter d1, 21 days/cycle) as first-line treatment according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. After five cycles (November 6, 2017–January 30, 2018), reexamination of mammary MRI () showed the size of the mass shrank from 91 mm × 55 mm × 87 mm to 84 mm × 48 mm × 72 mm. According to the evaluation criteria of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, we judged the therapeutic effect as stable disease (SD).
Based on the NOAH test (), limited cycles of joint application of trastuzumab and anthracycline were effective and had controllable cardiac toxicity. Therefore, we choose ECH (epirubicin, 90 mg/m2 d1; cycloposphamide, 600 mg/m2 d1; trastuzumab, 6 mg/kg d1, 21 days/cycle) regimen as second-line treatment (February 27, 2018–May 23, 2018). After four cycles, re-examined mammary MRI () showed that the tumor shrank from 84 mm × 48 mm × 72 mm to 66 mm × 29 mm × 56 mm. According to the evaluation criteria of RECIST v1.1, the therapeutic effect was still SD. There was no significant change in the appearance of the breast ().
As the efficacy still did not reach PR, the regimen was altered to nab-paclitaxel combined with trastuzmab. For metastatic breast cancer patients who had received prior taxanes, nab-paclitaxel plus still has the objective response rate of 54.2% (), and nab-paclitaxel plus traszumab to EC was superior to taxanes combined with trastuzumab to EC as neo-adjuvant therapy in GBG 69 trial (). Therefore, we choose nab-paclitaxel plus trastuzumab as the third-line treatment (nab-paclitaxel, 125 mg/m2 d1, d8; trastuzumab, 6 mg/kg d1, 21 days/cycle). The patient got PR after the first two cycles (), but two cycles later, the efficacy deteriorated to progressive disease (PD) ().
As the patient had developed acquired trastuzumab resistance after three lines of trastuzumab-based regimen, another regimen with distinct mechanism of anti-HER2 therapy was needed. To investigate the potential reason of drug resistance, a next-generation gene sequencing (NGS) of 425-gene panel was performed using the tissue repunctured from the tumor. According to the NGS report, persistent existence of ERBB2, CDK12, and MYC amplification with abundance of 15.7, 16.2, and 7.6 were detected, respectively. Meanwhile, there were mutations as p.R314H on IDH1 gene and p.H179R on TP53 gene. On ERBB2 gene, the patient had L755S () and K907R mutation. L755S mutation indicated resistance to trastuzumab and lapatinib (, ) and may be sensitive to neratinib (), an irreversible pan-HER TKI. At that time, neratinib had not been admitted to China, and a similar agent, pyrotinib, had just been approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (cFDA), whose phase II trial had indicated that for the treatment of advanced HER2-positive breast cancer patients, pyrotinib combined with capecitabine had better efficacy than lapatinib combined with capecitabine (). Thus, we selected pyrotinib plus capecitabine (pyrotinib, 400 mg/d d1–21; capecitabine, 1,250 mg/m2 bid d1–14, 21 days/cycle) as the fourth-line treatment regimen. After six cycles (August 28, 2018–December 29, 2018), the patient got PR (), and the surface of the breast almost completely healed ().
Left breast cancer mastectomy and local rotation skin flap grafting were performed on the patient in January 16, 2019, and postoperative pathology report showed an invasive ductal carcinoma with changes in Miller–Payne Grade 4 (), with a tumor size of 1.0 cm × 0.8 cm × 0.8 cm and lymph nodes negative (0/14). Immunohistochemistry indicated ER (−), PR (−), C-erbb-2 (+++), and ki-67 (70%+) ().
The patient continued to receive pyrotinib plus capecitabine (pyrotinib, 400 mg/day d1–21; capecitabine, 1,250 mg/m2 bid d1–14, 21 days/cycles) synchronous with radiotherapy (left chest wall plus left supraclavicular area, 5,000 cGy/25f), and pyrotinib plus capecitabine continued to be administrated for 1 year. There were no signs of metastasis or recurrence after an overall examination after 1 year of adjuvant therapy with pyrotinib plus capecitabine. The patient suspended capecitabin due to severe hand–foot syndrome and took pyrotinib as single agent for another 1 year (), partially referred to ExteNET clinical trial (). By the time of contribution, the second (June 2019) and last regular follow-ups (March 2021) showed no signs of metastasis or recurrence ().","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 75-year-old nonsmoking woman presented to our emergency department due to progressive shortness of breath for 3 days. She denied fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, or tenesmus. She had been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis at our hospital and received mesalazine 2 g per day for 2 years and 8 months.
Her initial vital signs were a blood pressure of 131/79mm Hg, pulse rate of 80 bpm, respiratory rate of 28/min and body temperature of 36.0°C. On physical examination, chest auscultation revealed coarse breathing sounds with bilateral crackles. Laboratory investigations revealed a white blood cell count of 10,600/μL with 79% neutrophils, hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 464,000/μL. Biochemistry profile showed an elevated level of C-reactive protein (79.7 mg/L), mildly impaired renal function (blood urea nitrogen level of 21.2 mg/dL and creatinine level of 1.23 mg/dL), and a normal alanine aminotransferase level (13 U/L).
Electrocardiography showed a normal sinus rhythm, and echocardiography of her heart was normal (left ventricular ejection fraction of 77%). Chest radiography revealed increased infiltration with patchy consolidations in both lungs and lower lobe predominance (Fig. A). She was then given oxygen via a nasal cannula. Under the impression of community-acquired pneumonia, she received antibiotic treatment and was admitted to our chest ward.
Episodic high fever was noted since admission, and chest radiography showed progression of bilateral infiltrates. Further investigations were thus warranted, and a computed tomography (CT) scan showed diffuse peribronchial and subpleural consolidations in bilateral lungs with minimal interstitial thickening. The differential diagnosis included cryptogenic OP, acute interstitial pneumonia, and metastasis (Fig. A). In the following days, her respiratory condition deteriorated, and she was given noninvasive ventilator support (bi-level positive airway pressure, BiPAP) (Fig. B). Under the consideration of mesalazine-induced OP, mesalazine was discontinued on the 8th day of admission, and intravenous hydrocortisone 100 mg Q6H was started. She was then transferred to our medical intensive care unit.
We performed infection surveys for viruses, fungi, and mycobacteria. Due to positive cytomegalovirus (CMV) serologic tests including both IgM and IgG, intravenous ganciclovir was given for 7 days until the results of CMV antigenemia assays and qualitative CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were negative. We also surveyed her autoimmune condition and vasculitis markers, and positive results of antinuclear antibodies and p-ANCA (antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, perinuclear pattern) were attributed to ulcerative colitis.
Her respiratory condition improved in the following days, although only a mild improvement was shown on serial chest plain films (Fig. C). Hydrocortisone 100 mg Q6H was maintained for 8 days and then tapered. BiPAP was shifted to an oxygen mask in the 2nd week of ICU admission.
Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, and a specimen was sent for bacterial, fungal, and viral cultures, PCR testing of tuberculosis and Pneumocystis jirovecii, galactomannan, total and differential cell counts, CD4/CD8 ratio, and cytology. The results showed 81% macrophages, 10% lymphocytes, 8.2% neutrophils, and 0% eosinophils, with CD4 and CD8 counts of 24.6% and 22.7%, respectively (CD4/CD8 ratio: 1.08). The BAL culture showed growth of Actinomyces odontolyticus, which may have been caused by aspiration of oropharyngeal secretion. A transbronchial lung biopsy was done, and the pathology report showed mild chronic inflammation with OP (Fig. ). There was no evidence of granuloma, malignancy, or vasculitis.
The patient was discharged on the 28th day of hospitalization with oral prednisolone 20 mg per day. She was regularly followed up at our chest out-patient department. One month after discharge, she had greatly reduced exertional dyspnea, and a chest plain film showed substantial improvements (Fig. D). A follow-up chest CT scan 3 months after disease onset showed resolution of most of the infiltration (Fig. B).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 28-year-old male patient presented with persistent scrotal erythema and inguinal striae of 6 months duration. He had a previous diagnosis of onychomycosis and tinea cruris treated with itraconazole. He had employed a topical combination cream of betamethasone, gentamicin, and clotrimazole for 14 months in the inguinal region with suspension 6 months before evaluation. He referred erythema, warmth, and dysesthesia. On examination, the patient had scrotal involvement and atrophic inguinal striae.

"A 47 year-old woman developed left side weakness after a right ACA infarction and was transferred to the department of rehabilitation medicine 3 weeks post onset. She had no remarkable medical history but was diagnosed with diabetes at our hospital. She had no family history of stroke. On transfer to our department, her mental status was alert but she had mild attention deficit. Her speech was normal and a K-MMSE score was 25. MMT grades of her left upper and lower extremities were all 3/5, except the wrist flexor and wrist extensor scores were both 2/5. She could perform fine motor activity with her left hand. She had no spasticity in her elbow and knee joints, with a MAS score of zero. Her deep tendon reflex was normoactive. Her superficial sensory responses were intact, but proprioception was impaired. She complained that her left hand was out of her control; her left hand ""took away"" objects out of her right hand. Her hands appeared to be directed at opposing purposes, showing 'intermanual conflict'. A brain MRI revealed acute cerebral infarction at the right ACA region, mainly at the right frontal lobe and corpus callosum (). In this case, when we stimulated the right motor cortex area, the rMT was 44% and the MEP amplitude was 314 µV. At the left motor cortex area, the rMT was 44% and the MEP amplitude was 456 µV. In the ICF study, when we stimulated the right motor cortex area, the MEP amplitude was increased to 876 µV. In the ICI study, theamplitude was not suppressed, but rather increased to 867 µV ().

"A 7-year-old girl presented with a 2-week history of shoulder-tip pain, progressive fever and right upper quadrant pain. She had no history of vomiting, diarrhea or weight loss.
On examination, she was febrile and had a palpable, firm mass in the right upper quadrant. She had a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 145/min and respiratory rate of 28/ min. Blood culture was negative and did not grow any organism. Serology for cytomegalovirus (CMV), Ebstein-Barr virus, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C and hydatid was negative. Serum α-fetoprotein levels of 0 and serum HCG <2 were recorded.
USG of the abdomen [] showed a large, mixed, complex solid-cystic lesion, which was predominantly a solid lesion with a heterogenous cystic component, within the right lobe of the liver with no flow or increased vascularity on color Doppler examination. CT scan revealed a well-defined, solitary, cyst-like hepatic mass []. No definite solid mass-like component, enhancing nodule or calcification/fat was appreciated. A few hyperdense areas were seen within this cystic-looking lesion. No vascular compromise or invasion was seen. No contrast enhancement was seen. Subsequently, an MRI of the abdomen was also performed [], which revealed the hepatic lesion to be predominantly hyperintense on the T2W images, but with central areas of low signal intensity. The T1W axial images [] revealed the lesion to be iso to heterogeneously hypointense and did not show any enhancement after intravenous contrast administration []. There was thus a discordance between the predominantly solid appearance on USG and the predominantly cystic appearance on CT scan and MRI.
She underwent surgical biopsy. Immunohistochemistry was performed, which revealed that tumor cells were positive for α-1-antitrypsin and α-1-antichymotrypsin and some cells were also positive for cytokeratosis. No positivity was seen for CD10 or desmin. Several CD68-positive macrophages were found. The myxoid morphology of the lesions, the presence of eosinophilic hyaline bodies and the immunohistochemical spectrum were typical for UES of the liver []. Rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation was not seen. Based on these findings, we arrived at a final diagnosis of UES of the liver.
This patient is presently on chemotherapy (ifosfamide, doxorubicin and ondansetron) and follow-up imaging (CT scan) has revealed mild reduction in size. Future plans include surgery, if feasible, followed by radiation and postoperative chemotherapy. This is the currently accepted clinical practice.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 52-year-old woman presented with a nine month history of generalized lymphadenopathy, skin lesions (multiple crusts all over her body), low fever, weight loss of more than 30 kg, vomiting, abdominal distension, mild dyspnea and a left breast mass (measuring 50 x 10 mm). She denied having any allergies or previous relevant diseases.
She was hospitalized for further investigation. Laboratory testing findings showed negative serology for HIV and viral hepatitis, anemia (hemoglobin 11.0 g/dL), and low serum albumin (2.3 g/dL), mild (prerenal) acute kidney injury, and elevated C-reactive protein (over 8 times the maximum reference value).
Chest radiography was performed and showed mild/moderate bilateral pleural effusions. In addition, the patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) of the neck, chest and abdomen. CT revealed the presence of a breast mass, generalized necrotic lymph node enlargement (cervical, axillary, mediastinal, abdominal and inguinal), mild splenomegaly, pleural effusion and ascites ().
She underwent a thoracocentesis that disclosed the presence of a milky fluid whose analysis showed a triglyceride concentration > 600 mg/dL, with no neoplastic cells. Additionally, paracentesis was performed, and the finding was consistent with chylous ascites, and neoplastic cells were not found.
Biopsies of the breast mass (core biopsy), skin lesions and enlarged inguinal lymph nodes were performed and stained using the Grocott-Gomori methenamine-silver (GGMS) technique, the gold standard to diagnose paracoccidioidomycosis according to guidelines. All of the biopsies revealed the presence of large round yeast cells with multiple narrow-based budding daughter cells, characteristic of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis.
Thereafter, liposomal amphotericin B was prescribed, as well as a high protein and low fat diet (supplemented with medium chain triglycerides). Despite the treatment, her clinical status worsened, with development of severe acute kidney injury that required renal replacement therapy, pneumonia, septic shock, and she subsequently died.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 33-year-old woman, who was on maintenance chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), presented to our clinic with chief complaints of severe headache and nausea. She had been diagnosed with ALL 2 years before this event and was in the process of receiving maintenance treatment under the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group ALL202-U protocol []. Her headache and nausea had started after receiving an intrathecal chemotherapy (methotrexate, cytarabine, and prednisolone) 2 weeks before; thus, she initially interpreted the headache as post-lumbar-puncture pain and consumed painkillers (loxoprofen and tramadol) that partially relieved her symptoms. However, her symptoms continued, and by the time of her visit to our clinic, she also developed other symptoms, such as photosensitivity, appetite loss, left temporal and eye pain, and tinnitus. She had no gastrointestinal symptoms or fever during the 2 weeks. She had no medical history before her diagnosis of ALL and had only one episode of septic shock with lung abscess during her course of chemotherapy, which was caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. She was on prophylactic antimicrobials, including atovaquone (leukopenia due to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), fluconazole, and acyclovir. Notably, she had eaten undercooked beef 2 days prior to admission. On admission, the patient experienced acute distress, had a body temperature of 36.2 °C, blood pressure of 130/88 mmHg, pulse rate of 87/min, respiratory rate of 18/min, and oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry of 100% on room air. The patient did not have neck stiffness, jolt accentuation, or any other neurologic deficits, such as cranial nerve abnormality, ataxia, or muscle weakness in her extremities. She had no abdominal tenderness or normoactive bowel sounds. Laboratory findings were the following: white blood cell count, 2400/μL (neutrophils, 58%; lymphocytes, 27.5%; monocytes, 11.5%); hemoglobin level, 11.5 g/dL; platelet count, 336,000/μL; blood urea nitrogen level, 10.2 mg/dL; creatinine level, 0.48 mg/dL; and C-reactive protein level, 3.74 mg/dL. Computed tomography of the brain did not reveal any abnormalities. Incidentally, her neutrophil count had been hovering around 1000/μL, a month prior to her admission. Her headache was so intense that we started intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with fentanyl.
On day 2, her temperature rose to 38.0 °C and jolt accentuation was observed. Lumbar puncture was performed, and CSF analysis showed a cell count of 71 (polymorphonucleocytes 59.2% and mononucleocytes 40.8%), protein level of 87 mg/dL, and glucose level of 82 mg/dL (serum glucose 124 mg/dL). No bacteria were observed under gram staining. We empirically initiated ampicillin 2 g intravenously (IV) every 4 h and ceftriaxone IV 2 g every 12 h. Her symptoms gradually improved. On day 4, spiral gram-negative rods were detected in blood cultures obtained on admission, and ampicillin was discontinued. On day 6, blood and CSF cultures revealed C. fetus, which was identified by an aerobic bottle, BacT/ALERT (bioMérieux, Inc., Durham, NC). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of this strain measured by E-test (bioMérieux) were as follows: meropenem, 0.064 μg/mL and cefotaxime, 16 μg/mL. Stool cultures were negative on day 9, and we switched from ceftriaxone to meropenem 2 g IV every 8 h (Fig. ). We excluded other metastatic foci, such as infective endocarditis, splenic or renal abscess, septic pulmonary emboli, or infected aneurysm. We continued meropenem for 3 weeks, and she was discharged without neurological sequelae.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"We present the case of a 24-year-old newly married woman, who was admitted to our hospital from the Emergency Department complaining of acute and constant left flank pain for 3 days with macroscopic haematuria.
This pain was nonradiating, was not related to meals, did not respond to over-the-counter analgesics, and was not associated with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or fever. This pain was preceded by macroscopic haematuria that appeared for 2 months before.
Personal and family history was noncontributory; especially she denied any history of surgeries, chronic illness, recent immobilisation, recent prolonged travel, or trauma or oral contraceptives. She was not pregnant. No thrombogenic factors were identified.
She reported no change in her bowel habits.
The patient's vitals were stable and exam revealed isolated left costovertebral angle tenderness. Physical examination revealed also a height of 172 cm and weight of 51 kg with a lower BMI at 17.2.
Her initial labs revealed only haemoglobin at 9.0 mg/dL.
Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) was performed demonstrating left renal vein thrombosis (), regardless of renal tumor or hydronephrosis. The CTA also showed a compression of the left renal vein (LRV) between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), SMA angle (the angle between aorta and SMA) was approximately 10°, the posteroanterior diameter of the hilar portion and that of the aorticomesenteric stenotic portion of the LRV were 9.9 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively (), and the diagnosis of anterior nutcracker syndrome leading to left renal vein thrombosis was confirmed.
When we asked her again, she reported a long history of various symptoms including intermittent macroscopic haematuria and chronic moderate left lumbar pain aggravated by physical activity, associated with systemic signs dominated by chronic fatigue and headache, which lasted for his childhood, despite a long investigational history combined with several imaging examinations and laboratory tests. Urinalysis revealed 4+ proteinuria, and 24 hour urine collection analysis showed 2 g of proteinuria.
Based on clinical presentation, urinary and systemic symptoms, laboratory reports, and computed tomographic angiography finding, a diagnosis of anterior nutcracker syndrome leading to left renal vein thrombosis was confirmed.
Anticoagulation was started by a low molecular weight heparin bridge to warfarin. Three weeks later, CTA showed complete disappearance of the renal vein thrombosis ().
The patient was informed of her diagnosis and there was a discussion about possible treatment options. We proposed transposition of left renal vein that the patient consented to.
Since she was newly married, it was decided to initially bridge her to warfarin with plans for 6 months of anticoagulation followed by repeated imaging. Need for additional management would be decided at that time.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 26-year-old female with NYHA class III dyspnea on exertion and easy fatigability was referred for surgery with the diagnosis of congenitally corrected transposition of great arteries (CCTGA), restrictive subaortic ventricular septal defect (VSD) and severe subpulmonic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. She was on Propranolol. Clinical examination showed an acyanotic patient with low volume pulses and a grade 3/6 ejection systolic murmur over the left sternal border. Chest X-ray revealed normal heart size, left ventricular (LV) type of apex, right aortic arch, and convex left upper border, suggestive of dilated ascending aorta and normal lung vascularity.
Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed situs solitus, levocardia, AV concordance, side by side orientation of the ventricles, and an anterior leftward aorta. The aorta appeared to override the interventricular septum but no definite VSD could be seen probably because of poor echo window. The pulmonary artery was seen to arise from the right ventricle with no evidence of pulmonary stenosis. A high velocity jet was seen in the subaortic region with a gradient of 100 mmHg. Double outlet right ventricle (DORV) with severely restrictive VSD, L-malposed aorta and unrestricted pulmonary blood flow was suspected on echo.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus rhythm, right axis deviation and LV dominance. The right axis deviation in the ECG was probably due to the side by side orientation of the ventricles. Catheterization showed situs solitus, atrioventricular (AV) and ventriculoarterial (VA) concordance with L-malposed aorta, LV pressure of 215 mmHg and RV pressure of 25 mmHg. There was a gradient of 140 mmHg during pullback from LV to aorta, suggesting severe subaortic LVOT obstruction. LV angiogram [] showed severe hypertrophy of LV, long tunnel-like fixed subaortic stenosis and mid-ventricular systolic narrowing. A diagnosis of ACMGA with severe tunnel-like obstruction of the LVOT was made after catheterization. She underwent LVOT resection and LVOT enlargement with modified Konno technique (ventricular septum opened below the subaortic area with resection of hypertrophied septum, followed by closure of iatrogenic VSD with bovine pericardial patch). The abnormal segmental relationship [] necessitated a combined transaortic and transatrial approach. She had an uneventful postoperative period. Postoperative echocardiogram revealed good relief of LVOT obstruction with residual gradient of 45 mmHg, mainly at mid cavity region []. On 6 months follow up, she was asymptomatic with mild to moderate AR and LVOT turbulence with a gradient of 20 mmHg.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 36-year old nulliparous female patient presented to our emergency department with acute lower abdominal pain, general discomfort, and elevated inflammatory markers. Her past medical history included obesity with a body-mass-index of 40, superficial vein thrombosis of the upper extremity and achilles tendon rupture. No bleeding abnormalities were reported. Cervical cancer screening including PAP smear was regularly performed and inconspicuous, most recently less than one year ago. On physical examination the patient presented significant rebound tenderness and involuntary guarding of the lower abdomen with a positive Blumberg sign. Speculum examination showed normal external female genitalia, normal vaginal epithelium, no abnormal discharge and a non-suspicious cervix. Significant cervical motion tenderness was observed during vaginal palpation. On vaginal ultrasound, the anteverted and anteflexed uterus showed no suspicious lesions. Bilateral adnexal masses with both cystic and solid aspects, remarkable hyperperfusion as well as free intraabdominal fluid were noted (Fig. a, b), suspicious for tubo-ovarian abscesses. During emergency laparoscopy, ruptured ovarian tumors with up to 8 cm sized cauliflower-like masses comprised of small cysts foremost of the right, but also of the left ovary were detected (Fig. a, b) and an enucleation of the cystic structures was performed.
On histopathological examination, a neoplasm with adeno-papillary growth of the inner female genital tract was described and the diagnosis of an eBOT with microinvasion of up to 1 mm was established. Following thorough postoperative discussion of the treatment options and their clinical impact, the patient decided against a fertility preserving approach favoring radical surgery including hysterectomy. Subsequently, laparoscopic staging was performed with hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, infracolic omentectomy and extensive peritoneal staging. In final histopathological results, an unexpected, HPV-high risk associated, intracervical endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the cervix uteri with a transversal diameter of 12 mm was diagnosed so that this was attributed as the primary tumor with ovarian metastases (Fig. a-f). Consistent with HPV high-risk association, the tumor showed strong immunohistochemical expression of p16 in the ovary and in the endocervix. CT scan of the thorax and abdomen showed no other distant metastases so that a subsequent laparoscopic lymph node staging was carried out to excluded tumor-infiltrated pelvic or para-aortic lymph nodes. Accordingly, final histopathological assessment led to a tumor stage of pT1b1 with ovarian metastases, pN0, L0, V0, Pn0, G2, R0, FIGO IB1. As individual decision making, an extended adjuvant treatment was applied consisting of chemoradiation followed by chemotherapy with four cycles paclitaxel and carboplatin according to the protocol of the currently recruiting OUTBACK trial (NCT01414608).","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 75-year-old man was referred to Chungbuk National University Hospital owing to urinary frequency. He had a history of transurethral resection of the bladder for invasive urothelial carcinoma 8 years previously. The tumor was of a low grade and invaded the subepithelial connective tissue. However, proper muscle involvement was not evaluable because the specimen had no proper muscle component. The patient had been treated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and had lived without recurrence. The patient underwent a transurethral biopsy under the clinical impression of recurrent urothelial cancer. There was widespread urothelial carcinoma in situ; therefore, radical cystoprostatectomy with orthotopic bladder substitution (Ghoneim) was carried out. Grossly, the mucosal surface of the urinary bladder showed multifocal flat erythematous lesions, and there were no remarkable lesions in the remainder. The microscopic findings showed multiple urothelial carcinoma in situ lesions throughout the mucosa of the urinary bladder and both ureters (). The left seminal vesicle was covered by large polygonal tumor cells, which were confined to the mucosa in single to several layers (). The tumor cells had large and hyperchromatic nuclei with distinct nuclear membranes and relatively abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. In addition, bizarre-shaped tumor cells showing irregular hyperchromatic or smudged nuclei were occasionally identified. The tumor cells mostly involved the mucosa between the epithelial cells and the basal lamina of the seminal vesicle, a feature that is referred to as pagetoid spread. In some areas, the entire thickness of the mucosa was replaced by tumor cells. The mucosa of the ejaculatory duct and adjacent prostatic acini and duct were also scattered with tumor cells (). On the basis of the overall findings, we considered that the urothelial carcinoma in situ of the urinary bladder revealed mucosal spread to the seminal vesicle along the ejaculatory duct. In addition, there was an incidental prostatic adenocarcinoma, which was a small, solitary lesion with a Gleason score of 6. At the time of the surgery, the patient's serum prostate-specific antigen level was 0.87 ng/ml.

"A 16-year-old male presented for evaluation of left shoulder pain, crepitus, and reduced ROM. Two weeks prior, he sustained a traumatic glenohumeral dislocation after a bicycle accident, which reduced spontaneously. Early rehabilitation provided no improvement to his restricted ROM or pain.
On physical examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable and extremely guarded. Apprehension and load and shift testing were consistent with anterior shoulder instability, and his ROM seemed reduced compared to typical dislocations. Plain film radiography revealed a 1 cm thin fragment of bone off the anterior glenoid, indicative of a bony Bankart (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed this, but on critical examination of axial cuts, the fragment appeared flipped with subchondral bone superficial to articular cartilage (). Based on his pain and the redislocation rate of his age group after traumatic dislocations, surgery was recommended [].
Intraoperatively, a posterior portal was created using bony landmarks, after which anterior and high rotator interval portals were established with the assistance of spinal needle localization to achieve an appropriate trajectory onto the glenoid. A 30° arthroscope was placed in the high interval portal, adjacent to the biceps tendon, and was used for subsequent exploration of the joint and image capture. A thin bony fragment with the articular surface deep and the bony surface superficial was present (Figures and ). Both articular cartilage abrasion (), possibly from articulating with the exposed subchondral fragment, and a small Hill-Sachs lesion were present on the humeral head. The anterior portal was used to allow access for a liberator, grasper, and rasp which were used to free up the partially healed fragment, achieve reduction, and freshen bony edges. A transsubscapularis (TSS) portal, as described by Dwyer et al., was established using a percutaneous set (Arthrex, United States) and a small metal 5.4 mm cannula to minimize potential injury to the subscapularis muscle []. The fragment was fixed using a double row technique as described by Millet and Braun using three Arthrex PushLock 2.9 mm anchors (Arthrex, United States) and #2 FiberWire suture (Arthrex, United States) (Figures and ) []. The capsule was then advanced over the top of the fragment using three additional PushLock anchors ().
Postoperatively, the patient had no major complications. He followed a graduated-intensity 18-week institutional physical therapy program consisting of two three-week and two six-week phases, which included passive and active ROM exercises and strengthening of shoulder musculature (). Plain film imaging four months postoperative indicated anatomic reduction of the fragment (). On examination, active shoulder ROM was assessed for both the repaired shoulder and the contralateral shoulder. Compared with the contralateral shoulder, the repaired shoulder exhibited the same ROM but lacked 15° of external rotation with hands at sides and 15° with the arm at 90° abduction. The patient was seen again six months postoperative and on examination exhibited excellent strength and no instability symptoms but still lacked 15° of external rotation both with arms at the sides and at 90° of shoulder abduction. By this point in time, the patient had resumed sporting activities including cross-country skiing and track and field.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 55-year-old man with a weight of 76 kg and height of 178 cm, suddenly experienced a nontraumatic loss of consciousness after a cough attack at an upright position as reported by a witness. Two months prior, he was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and had been receiving antituberculosis treatment. On arrival, the patient was unconscious with a Glasgow coma scale score of 6, blood pressure of 169/89 mm Hg, regular heart rate of 85 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 18/minute, body temperature of 36.5°C, SaO2 of 82% at room air, and capillary blood sugar of 110 mg/dL. Auscultation of the lungs revealed an inspiratory crackle at the left lung field. After rapid intravenous access and oxygenation, the patient was sedated, the trachea was intubated, mechanical ventilation was initiated, and conservative treatment was maintained in the intensive care unit. Urgent computed tomography (CT) of the brain was performed and showed multiple air shadows in both hemispheres and the right cerebral vessels (). These lesions suggest air embolism. Twelve hours later, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed and showed a diffuse ischemic stroke in the right and left frontoparietal cortical areas and multiple hypointense signals, which were consistent with cerebral air embolism ().
The brain perfusion images were normal. The chest CT performed at the emergency department showed pulmonary tuberculosis cavity associated with the destruction of parenchyma in the left upper lobe (). There was no evidence of cerebral hemorrhage. The diagnosis of cerebral gas embolism after sudden cough was retained, and immediate treatment was started including 100% oxygen and cardiovascular support while the patient was placed in a supine position. The transthoracic echocardiography was performed, and no patent foramen ovale was found. A lumbar puncture was performed to seek for tuberculous meningoencephalitis. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was considered, but the patient’s condition was too unstable to support transfer to the hyperbaric oxygen center. One day later, his neurological status deteriorated. The patient died on the fourth day with multiple organ failure. No autopsy was performed based on his family’s wishes.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 79-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital complaining of severe abdominal pain with unknown causes for 4 hours. The pain got worse after 2 hours with an acute hypotension (blood pressure drop from 106/79 mmHg to 61/44 mmHg), heart rate elevation (from 80 beats/min to 100 beats/min) and blunted. Laboratory investigation noted a decrease of hemoglobin from 119 g/dL to 62 g/dL in half an hour. Emergent computed tomographic angiography (CTA) showed the presence of a very tortuously ruptured AAA that now was 10.33 cm in diameter with a 90° neck angle (Figure A). The rupture, which extended from 2.5 cm below the opening of bilateral renal arteries down to the celiac artery and elongated to both common iliac arteries, involved the inferior mesenteric artery. Although the two iliac arteries were unobstructed with a 2.1 cm and 1.8 cm diameter of the right and left respectively, the right iliac artery was severely tortuous with a ‘S’ appearance (Figure B and C).
Previous medical history was normal except that she had a hypertension for more than 10 years with a maximum blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg, and was diagnosed of AAA by CTA with a maximum diameter of 6 cm in 2009. She refused to follow up because of no abdominal symptoms since then. She had no surgical history. Given the age of the patient and the emergent status, an endovascular approach was conducted despite the hostile neck. The time of door-to-cath lab was about 70 minutes. After local anesthesia, a 6-F, 11 cm-long introducer sheath (Cordis, Johnson & Johnson, NJ, USA) was placed percutaneously through the left groin for the diagnostic angiography, which confirmed the existence of an unfavorable aneurysm inferior to the renal artery (Figure A and Additional file : Movie S1). An 18-F, 30-cm-long sheath (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) was introduced and a 28-12-160-mm Excluder aortic main body (W.L. Gore &Associates) was deployed below the origin of the bilateral renal arteries (Additional file : Movie S2). Another 18-F, 30-cm-long sheath (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) was used, and two iliac legs of 20–120 and 20–100 (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) were placed superior to the opening of the right hypogastric respectively.
The guidewire was hard to enter the iliac leg due to the severely tortuous right iliac artery (Additional file : Movie S3), and therefore balloon-assisted technique was designed. The balloon was deployed in the proximal part of the main body and then inflated, thus keep the stiff wire in place which allowing the positioning of the guidewire (Figure B and Additional file : Movie S4).
In order to avoid the type Ib endoleak, we deployed a 26–30 cuff above the bifurcation of the iliac artery (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) (Figure C). A 20–140 iliac leg was placed above the bifurcation of the left iliac artery (Figure D). The stent-grafts were dilated using balloons (CODA, COOK, USA). The following angiography showed a severe Ia endoleak in the proximal neck (Figure E and Additional file : Movie S5), and therefore, a 32–4.0 Cuff (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) was deployed distal to opening of the left renal artery with off-the-shelf solution [] (Figure F).
Final angiography confirmed successful sealing of the rAAA with continued perfusion of both celiac and right renal arteries, and the aortic body pulsation disappeared accordingly (Figure G, H and Additional file : Movie S6). The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged home after 6 days. She is well and symptom-free 6 months later. Follow-up CT at 6 months demonstrated fluent celiac and bilateral renal arteries (Figure ).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 65-year-old female patient with staphylococcal native mitral valve infective endocarditis had a witnessed onset of right-sided hemiparesis and aphasia (NIHSS 18). The patient was initially admitted in a local hospital for infective endocarditis and treated with teicoplanin and gentamicin. The patient was brought to our emergency department 3 h and 45 min after she developed her stroke symptoms. Her past medical history included also liver cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and breast cancer. CT angiography showed an occlusion of both M2 divisional branches. Intravenous thrombolysis was contraindicated because of the evidence of endocarditis. Mechanical thrombectomy was considered due to the large vessel occlusion. Despite several attempts at aspiration, the clot remained in situ with the final angiography demonstrating a subtotal occlusion of both the M2 divisional branches (TICI 1). After 24 h, her NIHSS was 21 and the CT showed no haemorrhagic transformation.

"About 6 months before at 22 weeks of gestation, a cystic lesion was identified during a routine obstetric ultrasound examination of the pelvic area in a 23-year-old female patient without any previous discomfort. Due to the compression of the cyst on the cervix, the delivery was achieved by caesarean section. Postpartum ultrasonographic examination showed that there was a 7.5 × 8.5 cm sized thin-walled cystic lesion in the midline of the pelvic region compressing the rectum, uterus and bladder (). The origin of the lesion could not be determined during the ultrasonographic examination. The T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a thin-walled hyperintensity in the uterus, and the rectum posterior while T1-weighted images revealed a hypointense cystic lesion. The cyst was not associated with the ovaries. The fourth and fifth sacral bones were not seen. In the posterior, the cyst was communicating with the spinal subarachnoid space (). Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with sacral agenesis and anterior sacral meningocele. In addition, MRI showed that the conus medullaris ended at the 4th lumbar spine level and a distinct arcuate uterus was observed. The patient's neurological examination was normal. Complete blood count and serum biochemical tests were within normal limits.
Because she planned another pregnancy, gynecological surgeons and neurosurgeons suggested to the patient a surgical management. But she denied.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 57-year-old male patient was admitted to our department with continuous back pain without any traumatic episode. The pain persisted for several months but progressively worsened with activity or while in the standing position with relief when lying down. A computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to rule out a compression fracture. The CT revealed a characteristic ‘polka dot’ pattern of the trabecular thickening involving the whole T12 vertebral body. The MRI showed the mass was high signal intensity on the T2 weighted images and low signal intensity on the T1 weighted images without epidural extension (). These findings resulted in the diagnosis of a vertebral hemangioma. Conservative treatment, including analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs, physiotherapy, and epidural steroid injections, was performed. However, the patient complained of progressively worsening back pain over the following 2 months and re-visited our institute.
The CT and MRI took 2 months later, demonstrated an expansile mass involving the vertebral body and the posterior element with epidural extension and cord compression at the T12 (). A preoperative embolization and vertebrectomy with reconstruction are recommended for aggressive vertebral hemangiomas. However, given the patient's intact motor power, a less invasive procedure was performed. The patient underwent intraoperative vertebroplasty and percutaneous screw fixation.
The patient received about 4 mL's of polymethylmethacrylate injected into the T12 vertebral body, followed by percutaneous screw fixation to prevent tumor growth and to enhance stability (). The pathological diagnosis was consistent with epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, which is an aggressive vertebral hemangioma (). After surgery, the patient's back pain improved dramatically, and he was transferred to the hemato-oncological department for low-dose radiotherapy. No further tumor growth was observed over 4 years after the procedure.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 54-year-old healthy male, presented with multiple, variably sized, nonhealing ulcers over his right lower leg since 3 months. It started as a single coin-sized ulcer over the shin, which rapidly increased in size with the simultaneous appearance of multiple new similar lesions and swelling over the right leg. The patient had received multiple courses of oral and intravenous antibiotics despite of which his disease was progressing. There was no history of apparent trauma or evidence of an immunocompromised state. History of excursion to Amazon rain forest 1-month prior to the onset of ulceration was present.
Cutaneous examination revealed irregularly shaped ulcers ranging in size from pinpoint to 9 cm × 5 cm, covered with seropurulent slough [] distributed nonlinearly over the extensor aspect of the right leg. Few of them were herpetiform in morphology. The involved limb presented a cellulitic picture with diffuse erythema and induration. There was no evidence of any preceding nodulation. A single thickened lymphatic cord was palpable on the medial aspect of the thigh in the later course of his disease.
All the hematological and biochemical investigations were normal except for a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (45 mm/h). Magnetic resonance imaging lower leg showed findings consistent with cellulitis with no deep extension, abscess, osteomyelitis, or muscular involvement.
Histopathology and tissue culture samples were sent with a differential diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum, mycobacterial infection, cutaneous leishmaniasis, and deep fungal infection. Repeated cultures for the same were negative. Histopathology revealed multiple, poorly formed, epithelioid cell granulomas along with diffuse infiltrates of lympho-histiocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils in the deeper dermis. Special stain (periodic acid-Schiff [PAS] and Gomori Methenamine silver stain) showed small budding and occasional elongated yeast cells in the dermis []. PAS stain from tissue imprints revealed cigar-shaped bodies suggesting Sprorothrix infection.
Patient was started on itraconazole capsules 200 mg twice daily monotherapy, with only marginal response. He developed multiple subcutaneous nodules and an ulcer over the right thigh even after 6 weeks of treatment. Thus, saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI) was added with complete clearance of the lesions in 10 weeks.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"Post-mortem examination of a 15 + 2 deceased female foetus born to a 39-year-old healthy woman revealed isolated bilateral kidney agenesis. The father of the foetus was diagnosed with kidney hypoplasia and minimal change nephropathy at the age of 36 years due to persistent proteinuria. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperuricaemia, both requiring medical therapy. However, at the age of 53 years, kidney function was only mildly impaired. The father has a strong family history of kidney disease ().
DNA extracted from foetal tissue was analysed using array comparative genomic hybridization. No pathogenic genomic copy number variants were identified. Subsequently, a gene panel (including CAKUT genes BMP7, CDC5L, CHD1L, EYA1, FRAS1, FREM1, FREM2, GATA3, GREM1, GRIP1, HNF1B, ITGA8, PAX2, RET, ROBO2, SALL1, SIX2, SIX5 and TBX18) was targeted for sequencing to identify putative disease-associated variants using next-generation sequencing. Smaller indels, up to 50 bp, were called in the variant analysis pipeline, whereas exon deletion/duplications were analysed using a copy number variation tool. These analyses only identified a heterozygous PAX2 missense variant c.68T>C [p.(Leu23Pro)].
Subsequently, the PAX2 candidate variant was assessed for cosegregation with kidney phenotypes in the family under study. The variant was identified in all family members affected by kidney disease for which DNA was available (). The kidney phenotypes seen in the family were remarkably heterogeneous, including bilateral kidney agenesis, minimal change nephropathy, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, duplex kidney with hydronephrosis of upper pole system and bilateral kidney hypoplasia with end-stage renal failure in early adult life or with only moderate chronic kidney failure in late adult life.
To study whether the severe foetal phenotype was exacerbated by additional variants in modifier genes, an additional 138 genes previously associated with kidney disease were analysed, including GREB1L, FGF20 and LMX1B. No additional candidate variants were identified.

"We report the case of a 25-year-old African-American male with OCA2, who was admitted in response to a phone call his mother made to emergency services after making threats to kill himself. The patient was admitted with symptoms of auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions of people stalking him and stealing his thoughts, self-neglect, depression, and suicidal thoughts, which, according to his mother had increased when he became medication noncompliant. He had been hospitalized and discharged one month prior at a different facility, when he had shot himself in the forehead with a BB gun in response to command auditory hallucinations. His mother called 911 when she discovered two BBs lodged in his forehead. He had been released after a two-week stay, but continued to experience command auditory hallucinations to kill himself. His mother again called 911 when he expressed his urges to attempt suicide again. Physical examination revealed the presence of one BB in his forehead, as well as nystagmus and hypopigmentation over his entire body. Social history revealed no smoking or alcohol usage, but a urine test was positive for cannabis. An inquiry into family history was made, and it was noted that the patient has a paternal female cousin with albinism (with no current signs of schizophrenia) and maternal grandmother with schizophrenia. As for his immediate family, there were no other cases of either schizophrenia or albinism among his biological parents or three siblings. According to his mother, he had previously lived a rather normal life (although more on the withdrawn side) and schizophrenic symptoms had only developed a few years prior, when he was around 22 years old.
The patient was started on risperidone, which was uptitrated to 6 mg daily, and escitalopram at 10 mg daily for ongoing depressed mood. This medication combination lessened the intensity of auditory hallucinations significantly, but he remained very depressed and isolative on the inpatient psychiatric ward, and continued to express thoughts of hopelessness. Lithium augmentation was started, and lithium was uptitrated to 900 mg daily. With the addition of lithium, the patient’s neurovegetative symptoms of depression and his sense of hopelessness lessened. He ceased to have thoughts of suicide, and began to interact with treatment staff, as well as psychotherapeutic rehabilitation activities offered on the ward. He also allowed treatment team to consult with ENT (ear, nose, and throat) services to have the BB removed from his forehead. He agreed to engage with intensive wrap-around mental health services, along with ongoing psychosocial rehabilitative treatment offered as part of outpatient mental health treatment. He returned home with his mother after his positive, cognitive, and negative symptoms of schizophrenia lessened to a degree that he no longer expressed any hopelessness or wishes to die.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 25 year-old female presented herself to a local clinic because of exposure to phogene. She had been in excellent health until September 8, 1995, when she was exposed to phosgene. She complained of coughing, chest tightness and dyspnea which were not relieved despite therapy with oxygen. She was transferred to CNUH about six hours after exposure.
Admitting vital signs were blood pressure 100/60 mmHg. pulse 110/min, respiration 20/min, temperature 36.4°C. Examination of the chest revealed bilateral inspiratory and expiratory crackles. The chest X-ray showed diffuse increased haziness on both lung field (). The WBC were 12.7 × 103/μl, the LDH 409 unit, initial arterial blood gases determinations on room air were, PaO2, 68.9 mmHg, PaCO2, 34.7 mmHg, pH, 7.392.
The patient was treated with a face mask with 8 L/min oxygen. On the second day of admission, she was transferred to the ICU with respiratory insufficiency. She had progressively increasing respiratory symptoms with the respiratory rate rising to 44/min, pulse rate to 114/min and blood pressure decreasing 70/40 mmHg. The WBC were 25.2 × 103/μl with 95.6% neutrophils and LDH was 665 unit. The arterial blood gases were PaO2, 41.2 mmHg, PaCO2 34.9 mmHg, pH, 7.364. The patient was intubated and ventilated with controlled mode and 8.0 cmH2O of positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was applied. Two hours after ventilation, the patient became cyanotic and oxygen saturation decreased to 60% and a chest X-ray showed pneumothorax on the right thoracic cavity. Chest tube was inserted with a water seal bottle. Five hours after controlled ventilation, arterial blood gases on FiO2 0.6 were PaO2, 60.4 mmHg, PaCO2, 31.3 mmHg, pH, 7.520. Ventilation was controlled with diazepam and vecuronium to reduce anxiety and fighting.
On the third day of ventilation, she was weaned from the ventilator and extubated. The patient received methylprednisolone (500 mg) for 7 days, 2 days of furosemide (120 mg), aminophylline, dopamine and antibiotics from the day of admission.

"The 9-year-old otherwise healthy girl presented with minimal physical clumsiness and progressive mild left hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a giant deep AVM. This lesion was considered a grade-V AVM according to Spetzler–Martin scale. Surgical treatment of the AVM was declined as it was too risky. Radiosurgical treatment was instituted due to the size and location of the AVM. She received one course of radiotherapy (20 Gr) resulting in a slight reduction in the size of the AVM. Last follow-up digital subtraction angiography (DSA) at the age of 12 showed no change in AVM [Figure and ]. At the age of 18, she admitted to our hospital with loss of consciousness and left hemiparesis (mRS score 5). A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed large intracerebral hemorrhage [] due to ruptured arteriovenous malformation.
The decision on the surgical treatment of the AVM was made with a help of endovascular embolization. Onyx embolization was admitted with minor success. Treatment continued with microsurgery. The patient was taken to the operative theater for the removal of intracerebral hematoma and resection of the AVM. During the evacuation of hematoma major intraoperative bleeding (1 L) occurred from Onyx embolized intranidal aneurysm. Bleeding was effectively held by emergency clipping of some feeders originating from the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Resection of the AVM could not be performed because of the unstable medical conditions of the patient.
Postoperatively, the patient clinical condition was the same neurologically as during admission. However, 3 days after the first operation, the patient's condition deteriorated suggesting intracranial hypertension. The patient underwent a placement of external drainage catheter with the intracranial pressure monitor. Intracranial hypertension was eliminated. Further treatment continued with a new round of endovascular modality. A new attempt of Onyx embolization through the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) was made. On the same day, the patient underwent a second microsurgical operation using the same craniotomy. We used total temporary clipping under mild hypothermia (33°C) for almost 4 hours; P2 segment of PCA, A1 segment of anterior cerebral artery, anterior choroidal artery (AChA), and the supraclinoid segment of internal carotid artery (ICA) []. Most of the lateral part of AVM underwent removal []. A postoperative angiogram demonstrated remaining medial and some of the lateral parts of AVM []. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) performed next day showed a lack of global ischemia []. The next day the patient underwent the third operation using the same craniotomy. Remaining part of the medial AVM was completely removed, and only a small lateral part was left.
Three weeks after the third operation, shunt for cerebrospinal fluid diversion was inserted, and the patient remained conscious with left hemiparesis. The patient was transported to the department of neurology for rehabilitation. However, few days later, new minor bleeding occurred, adjacent to the residual part of the AVM. Two embolizations were performed through MCA and PCA. Residual part filling via MCA was completely occluded, however, small residual filling via PCA remained [Figure and ].
Shunt for cerebrospinal fluid diversion was removed. Ten days later, the patient underwent the last microsurgical operation. Eventually, AVM was completely occluded [Figure –]. The patient was discharged with strong left hemiparesis, visual changes, memory difficulties, and aphasia (mRS score 4). These symptoms gradually improved, and 5 years after her initial surgery, she could walk without assistance, however, visual changes and memory difficulties remained (mRS score 3) [].","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 63-year-old man presented with exertional dyspnea in the background of normal cardiac evaluation, and computer tomography (CT) findings of a vascular malformation in the posterior mediastinum (). The malformation was supplied by 4 arteries (right bronchial artery and three intercostals) arising from the thoracic aorta with a large vascular mass in the posterior mediastinum and single drainage vessel into the right upper lobe pulmonary artery (). The appearance was consistent with a BP-AVM.
In view of the size and the risk of hemoptysis, the patient was referred for embolization. Through a left common femoral vein access, the right upper lobe pulmonary was accessed. The drainage vessel arising the superior segmental artery of the right upper lobe was first cannulated. However, due to the angulation of the artery with sheath instability, a tri-axial system was needed to allow deep catheterization required for vascular plug embolization (). This consisted of an 8.5F Agilis NxT (St Jude Medical, Minnetonka, MN, USA) steerable sheath positioned in the ostium of the segmental artery, followed by an 8F Mach 1 guiding catheter (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) and a 5F 125 cm long Ultimate 1 diagnostic catheter (Merit Medical Systems, Inc., South Jordan, UT, USA) inserted co-axially. In a telescoping fashion, the guiding catheter was advanced over the diagnostic catheter and guidewire to reach a stable position within the segmental pulmonary artery, and a 16 mm Amplatzer AVP II vascular plug (St Jude Medical) was deployed, occluding the solitary drainage pulmonary artery ().
Through a right common femoral artery access, aortography demonstrated the 4 feeding arteries as seen on CT (). The plan was for staged coil/plug embolization (without particulate embolics) of the feeding arteries (2 arteries in a single sitting) due to the difficulty in resolving any potential spinal supply. If needed, we would return for an interval embolization of the remaining two vessels. The largest supplying artery (intercostal artery) was first cannulated and a 6F Brite-tip sheath (Cordis, Miami, FL, USA) was used to deliver a 12 mm AVP II plug successfully deployed (). The hypertrophied right bronchial artery was then accessed using a Progreat microcatheter and embolized using a total of 8 Interlock coils ranging from 5 to 12 mm in size (Boston Scientific) (). Completion angiography showed complete embolization of the two vessels with significant slow flow into the malformation through the remaining two untreated arteries ().
The immediate post-embolization CT at day 1 showed significant thrombosis of the BP-AVM () and the patient was discharged well. At 6 months follow-up CT, complete thrombosis with a significant reduction in size of the BP-AVM was demonstrated ().

"A 40-year-old woman originally from Ecuador was referred to our institution for evaluation of progressive dyspnea on exertion. Two months prior to her presentation, she was treated at an outside hospital for presumed community acquired pneumonia with symptoms of dyspnea on exertion, fevers, chills, and productive cough. After not seeing measurable improvement, the patient then presented to the emergency department at another institution where a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed that the patient had a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology and a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60%. Pericardiocentesis was performed with 700 cc of fluid removed, which grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). The patient's purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test was positive. The patient was started on anti-TB therapy and discharged.
She continued to complain of persistent dyspnea on exertion and thus was referred to our institution for a repeat of TTE at the outpatient cardiac diagnostic center. TTE revealed the rare presystolic flow through pulmonic valve, excessive variation in the mitral valve and aortic valve spectral Doppler velocities, and markedly thickened pericardium (Figures –), consistent with constriction []. The study also demonstrated septal bounce, small pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion. The patient was admitted for further evaluation. On admission, the patient's vital signs showed a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, a blood pressure of 108/70, a heart rate of 117, and respiratory rate of 20 with an oxygen saturation of 99% in room air. Her exam revealed a young woman in mild distress with 11 cm internal jugular vein distension, decreased breath sounds at lung bases bilaterally and scant bibasilar crackles, regular tachycardia, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Her BNP was 124, CRP was 5.1, and WBC count was 5.9 with a normal differential. Her complete metabolic panel was unremarkable. The patient underwent a left and right heart catheterization due to the suspicion of constrictive pericarditis. A coronary angiogram demonstrated no obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease. The right heart catheterization revealed elevated right atrial pressure, right ventricular end diastolic pressure, and an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Simultaneous right and left ventricular pressure tracings demonstrated discordant respiratory variation consistent with constrictive pericarditis. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her chest with contrast confirmed marked thickening of both the parietal and pleural pericardial surfaces, measuring up to 13.4 mm in thickness, and a large right-sided pleural effusion (Figures and ). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast showed diffuse pericardial thickening (), which showed intense delayed gadolinium contrast enhancement () that did not involve the myocardium. Additionally, there was a greater interventricular septal bounce during diastole and inspiration, consistent with chronic inflammatory constrictive pericarditis.
Due to her worsening symptoms and diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis, she was referred to cardiothoracic surgery at our institution for pericardiectomy. The surgery was without incident and the surgical samples were sent for pathology. While being negative for AFB by concentrated smear and culture, the stripped pericardium showed noncaseating granulomas, extensive fibrosis, and severe lymphohistiocytic infiltrate.
In the immediate postoperative period, the patient began to develop signs and symptoms of central volume overload, heart failure, and hypotension. An electrocardiogram (ECG) at this time showed sinus tachycardia with nonspecific ST-T abnormalities with poor R wave progression, new from prior ECGs. A subsequent TTE on postoperative day one showed significant changes from the prior study, with severely decreased biventricular dysfunction. The LVEF was severely depressed at 26%, with early evidence of elevated filling pressure within the left ventricle, indicated by the time difference between pulmonary vein (Ar) duration and mitral A-wave duration (Ar-A) of positive 46 ms. For the right ventricle, fractional area change (FAC) was abnormally low at 29%, with reduced tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) distance of 0.96 cm. There was also moderate tricuspid regurgitation, enlarged right atrium (area 27 cm2), and moderately elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 41 mmHg. There was akinesis of the entire apical and midventricular segments of both the right and left ventricles (Figures –) with hypercontractile base. Findings were consistent with stress cardiomyopathy.
While in critical condition postoperatively, the patient had episodes of atrial fibrillation and atrial tachycardia, for which she was chemically cardioverted with intravenous amiodarone, with subsequent conversion to sinus rhythm. Initially, the patient required multiple vasopressors and inotropes (epinephrine, norepinephrine, milrinone, and dopamine drip) to maintain her blood pressure and cardiac output, while gentle diuresis was achieved carefully for the symptoms of heart failure. Once the patient was hemodynamically stable, she was placed on appropriate oral medical therapy, including carvedilol and furosemide, followed by gradual clinical improvement and was able to be discharged on postoperative day 10. Due to decreased urine output and hypotension, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker was not initiated at the time. A posthospital TTE 7 weeks after discharge showed normalized function of both the right and left ventricles (Figures –).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year. Exclusion Criteria: Younger than 65 years old, having decompensated liver disease, psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance, having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy.",1
"A 60-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with a complaint of right lower abdominal pain. The patient did not have same symptoms before, and he only had a medical history of asthma. The laboratory data on admission showed a slightly elevated WBC count of 9,300/μl and a CRP level of 1.0 mg/dl, but the tumor marker levels (CEA, CA19-9) were almost within the normal limits. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a 15-cm large cystic mass, like a dilated intestine, and fluid collection was observed inside.
The cystic mass was adhered to the ileum, but there was no definite communication to the ileum. The feeding arteries of the cyst were communicating branches from the upper mesentery artery, and the lymph nodes around the cyst were slightly swollen (Figure a,c). At the small-bowel follow-through exam, the cyst did not come out, but it did exclude normal intestine (Figure b). There were not significant findings during a colonoscopic examination.
Based on these findings, we diagnosed the cyst as an ileal duplication and decided to perform surgery in order to prevent a recurrence of abdominal pain and lethal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.
We employed a four-port laparoscope-assisted resection of the duplicated ileum and segmental resection of the normal ileum. An umbilical port was used for a mini-laparotomy with a zigzag skin incision (Figure a). The cyst’s stalk was attached to the base of the mesentery of the terminal ileum, approximately 40 cm from the ileocecal junction (Figure b,c). After resection of the cyst, a side-to-side anastomosis of the ileum was made with a stapler.
The resected specimen showed an ileal duplication of 18 × 7 cm in diameter, filled with purulent matter with some ulcers inside (Figure a). The histological findings showed that it had a mucus gland inside, like intestinal epithelium, and was covered with two layers of smooth muscle. There was no communication between the duplication and normal ileum, but they had a common muscle layer (Figure b,c).
The postoperative period was uneventful without any asthma attack, and the patient was discharged on the 13th postoperative day.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 54-year-old woman presented to her personal physician and complained the pain on her right breast. She underwent a breast surgery in our hospital. The patient and her family’s medical histories were unremarkable.
The patient was 157 cm tall and weighed 53 kg. Physical examination of the right breast (area C) revealed an elastic hard mass measuring 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm. Margins were distinct, with relatively good mobility and a tumor-nipple distance of 3.2 cm. No axillary or cervical lymph nodes were palpable. Hematological and biochemical blood test results were normal. The levels of tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 15-3, and National Cancer Center-Stomach-439, were within normal limits.
Mammography revealed an indistinct margined hyper dense mass in the right outer portion, which was assessed as Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System category 4C (: MLO view, : CC view). Breast ultrasonography (US) revealed complex cystic lesion, and the tumor was large with 2.5 cm diameter (). Complex cystic lesion on US with blood content on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology revealed malignant cells. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and a T2 weight image revealed an early enhancement image with no intraductal spread (). No distant metastases was identified on computed tomography or bone scan. The tumor stage was T2N0M0. Breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed.
The results exposed two sentinel lymph nodes and no malignant cell. The tumor measured 2.0 cm in diameter and contained a central cystic area (,). Histopathological examination showed low papillary growth in the cystic cavity surface, which was covered by adenocarcinomatous components associated with some squamous metaplasia. Most of the lesions comprising the cyst wall were a mixture of irregular bundles of spindle-shaped tumor cells and fibrous connective tissue proliferation. The tumor was diagnosed as spindle cell ().
Immunostaining of spindle-shaped tumor cells showed positive results for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) and vimentin (,), partially positive results for s-100, and negative results for desmin and α-actin. The final histopathological diagnosis was spindle cell carcinoma. Histological grade from malignancy was grade III. Lymphatic invasion was negative, whereas blood vessel invasion was positive. Lymph node metastasis was negative, and p-stage I was diagnosed. Estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2), which showed negative results by biochemical tests, were called triple negative type in subtype classification. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient received six courses of FEC-100 chemotherapy. Radiotherapy included simultaneous integrated boost enforced 60 Gy (2 Gy/day) to the residual breast tissue. After 24 months of postoperation, no recurrence has been detected.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 13-year-old girl presented with a history of abdominal distension, back ache, and loss of appetite and weight of 3 months’ duration. Her medical history was otherwise unremarkable. On examination, an ill-defined mass of 10 cm × 8 cm size was palpable in the right hypochondrial region, extending 7 cm below the right costal margin and medially up to the umbilical region. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed a large, heterogeneous mass of 18 cm × 16 cm × 16 cm size arising from the right adrenal, infiltrating the right lobe of liver, and displacing the right kidney inferolaterally.
Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the adrenal mass showed clusters of malignant cells forming rosettes in an eosinophilic fibrillary background with high nuclear cytoplasmic ratio. In addition, scattered ganglion cells with eccentric-placed nuclei and prominent nucleoli were also present and features were consistent with ganglioneuroblastoma [].
The 24-h urinary vanillyl mandelic acid VMA level was 5.4 mg/24 h (normal is < 7 mg/24 h). Radiography of the lumbo-sacral spine showed mixed lytic and sclerotic lesion involving the L3 vertebrae [] and confirmed by computed tomography (CT) soft tissue with bone window []. To assess the extent of neuroblastoma and metastasis, PET-CT was done. It showed [Figures and ] increased uptake in the right adrenal and liver areas with metastatic involvement of L3 vertebrae. These imaging findings and FNAC reflected the diagnosis of ganglioneuroblastoma; stage IV (vertebral and liver metastasis). The patient was treated with intravenous zoledronic acid[] and carboplatin, vincristine, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide[] based chemotherapy regimen.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"Before presentation to our hospital, the 27-year old nulliparous female, was diagnosed with a left-sided endometrioid BOT at an external institution. She had already undergone fertility-sparing surgery with adequate staging procedures including left-sided salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy by open surgery. External histopathological findings revealed a single peritoneal implant in the left paracolic gutter. Three months later she presented for first consultation to our department with a highly suspicious contralateral ovary in vaginal ultrasound (Fig. a, b). On physical examination, the patient presented with no acute distress and a soft, nontender, nondistended abdomen. She denied any abnormal vaginal bleeding. Pelvic examination was unremarkable as well as cervical cytology. Vaginal ultrasound revealed a 7 mm thickness endometrium of with slightly inhomogeneity but without any suspicious lesions. The right ovary presented highly suspicious for malignancy consisting of cystic and solid aspects with abnormal perfusion.
According to her explicit request for fertility preservation, we performed a re-laparotomy with salpingo-oophorectomy of the right side and cryoconservation of healthy appearing ovarian tissue. To increase oncological safety in this constellation, hysteroscopy and curettage was additionally performed. Pathological evaluation revealed a progression of the previously diagnosed eBOT to a well-differentiated endometrioid ovarian carcinoma limited to the ovary and sized 25 mm, positive peritoneal washings and a corresponding FIGO stage IC3 with accompanying superficial endometriosis in peritoneal biopsies. Unexpectedly, uterine curettage revealed an endometrioid endometrial cancer (Fig. a-d). As a consequence, completion surgery consisting of a total abdominal hysterectomy, pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy was performed. No further peritoneal lesions were noted. Histopathological examination diagnosed a moderately differentiated endometrioid endometrial cancer without extrauterine tumor growth with a corresponding FIGO stage IA (pT1a pN0 (0/65) L0 V0 Pn0 G2 R0). While both carcinomas of the ovary and of the endometrium displayed similar histomorphological and immunohistochemical characteristics, the possibility of an ovarian dissemination of the endometrial carcinoma could not be ruled out at this point. However, due to the limited extent of the endometrial cancer and the patient´s history of eBOT, it appeared more likely that two independent carcinomas developed synchronously. No mismatch repair deficiency was detected. Finally, an adjuvant mono chemotherapy consisting of six cycles carboplatin was recommended.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"An 80-year-old male was being investigated at a tertiary hospital for iron deficiency anaemia. His medical history, symptomology and physical examination did not indicate a cause. After gastroscopy and colonoscopy were also unremarkable he was referred for capsule endoscopy. The delivery of the capsule in the morning was routine; however, review of the images 8 hlater showed a static picture and no evidence the capsule had entered the stomach. The patient was clinically stable and contacted to present to the emergency department with a suspicion of capsule impaction.
A chest radiograph demonstrated a metallic object at the level of the second thoracic vertebra to the left of the trachea (). The patient had no known oesophageal or tracheal diverticulum and expressed no symptoms of dysphagia. To pinpoint the exact anatomical location of the foreign body a non-contrast CT scan of the neck () was performed. The effective dose of CT was 0.81 mSv. This confirmed the object was the capsule endoscope lying to the left of the hypopharynx. The adjacent soft tissue was obscured by aliasing metal artefacts arising from the capsule. A single photon metal artefact reduction (MAR) software technique (O-MAR; Philips Healthcare, Cleveland, OH) was applied which successfully removed most of the metallic artefacts. It revealed the capsule was impacted in an oesophageal diverticulum.
The capsule was successfully endoscopically removed under a general anaesthetic and the patient’s recovery was uncomplicated. A follow-up barium swallow study confirmed the presence of a Zenker’s diverticulum which the patient opted not to surgically repair as he was asymptomatic. He was also offered endoscopic insertion of the capsule endoscope to bypass the diverticulum; however, the patient refused. His anaemia resolved with iron transfusions but no definitive cause was found. He was discharged from the clinic.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A female patient aged 60 years (with skin type III according to Fitzpatrick), with moderate chronic plaque psoriasis (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] =7.7), came to the dermatological clinic to receive phototherapy. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee at the University of Gothenburg and the National Data Inspection Board (approval number DNR:089–12, T285-16). The patient´s written informed consent was obtained for case details and publishing accompanying images. The patient was treated with NBUVB therapy (311 nm, according to standard protocol, 28 sessions, total dose 3.0 J/cm2 (increasing from 0.3 to 3.0 J/cm2) and psoriasis significantly improved (PASI =0.6). Four 4 mm punch biopsies were taken, one from intralesional psoriatic skin and one from perilesional healthy skin (about 2 cm from the psoriasis plaque) before and 24 hours after the last NBUVB session (). The biopsies were wrapped in aluminum foil and frozen at −70°C. Each sample was sectioned into 10 μm thin slices and placed on conductive glass slides. The whole process is illustrated in .

"This patient, a five-year-old African-American female, fell at school and developed severe left knee pain. Three days after falling, the patient's mother contacted her primary-care physician where she reported her daughter's severe left knee pain that prevented her from walking and had worsened since the initial injury. At this point, the patient's left knee was also warm and erythematous. She and her daughter were referred to her local emergency department where radiographs of the patient's left knee were conducted and were read as unremarkable with no signs of trauma (). The patient was, therefore, diagnosed with a left knee sprain and was treated conservatively with pain control (ice and NSAIDs) and NWB without further intervention.
Eleven days later, the patient was seen by her primary-care physician for her persistent limp and intermittent pain, although her swelling had resolved. Anteroposterior view of the pelvis and bilateral frog lateral radiographs were ordered to rule out any hip pathologies, which could also cause an antalgic gait. All films were read by an attending radiologist and were deemed unremarkable. Relying on these reads, the primary-care physician recommended the patient to continue supportive care (NSAIDs and ice for pain, nonweight bearing for left lower extremity) and to refer to an orthopedist if symptoms persisted.
Despite these treatments, the patient's pain and limp persisted, and the patient then sought a referral to a general pediatric orthopedist for further work-up. Although the child's pain had slightly improved, her limp remained. She described her left knee pain as worse at night but responsive to acetaminophen and ice. She had never felt anything like this before prior to her initial fall. Both the patient and her mother denied fever, weight loss, fatigue, malaise, or recent infection. On physical exam, her left knee did not have a palpable mass, muscle atrophy, or edema, but was tender to palpation. Given concern for the persistent pain and antalgic gait, repeat radiographs of the left knee were also ordered by the orthopedist and showed aggressive poorly defined lytic lesion centered within the left distal femur metadiaphysis extending up proximally 6 cm superiorly from the metaphysis with associated interrupted superior periosteal involvement (). A radiologist reviewed these findings and agreed with the orthopedist that based on these radiographic findings, there was concern for a primary bone malignancy. Arthrocentesis of the left knee was performed to rule out a possible infectious etiology, which was negative. Acute-phase reactants including c-reactive protein, sedimentation rate, and leukocyte count were all within normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and needle biopsy were ordered to establish diagnosis. Contrast-enhanced MRI examination showed a enhancing mass centered in the distal femoral metaphysis approximately 7 cm in craniocaudal dimension with aggressive periosteal involvement (). Needle biopsy of the left distal femur was performed at the site of the lesion, and pathology demonstrated cores of tumor tissue consisting of pleomorphic tumor cells with frequent mitoses, foci of necrosis, regions of chondroblastic differentiation, and rare small foci of malignant osteoid production, consistent with the diagnosis of osteosarcoma. Additional imaging, including chest computerized tomography (CT) and whole body Positron Emission Tomography (PET), was obtained for tumor staging and demonstrated no evidence of distant metastases.
The patient was then referred to an orthopedic surgeon to discuss treatment options including oncologic and operative interventions. Given the concern for pathological fracture and possible subsequent contamination of healthy tissue from this tumor, the patient was placed in a knee immobilizer to limit weight bearing (NWB LLE with walker). The patient and her parents were referred to an oncologist to determine a chemotherapy plan. A typical treatment plan of osteosarcoma involves surgical resection and six cycles of chemotherapy (two cycles preoperatively as neoadjuvant therapy and four cycles postoperatively) with high-dose methotrexate, doxorubicin/dexrazoxane, and cisplatin.
Operative treatments were discussed between the family and the attending orthopaedic surgeon in great detail including potential risks and benefits, and the family chose to proceed with Van Nes Rotationplasty. Radical resection of the left distal femur 17 cm from the joint line with femur/tibia osteoplasty with internal fixation and Van Nes Rotationplasty of the left lower extremity and left sciatic neuroplasty was performed. The procedure lasted around eight hours long without complications. Estimated blood loss was 100 mL or less. The patient was transferred to the PICU for monitoring postoperatively. There were no wound complications postoperatively, and the patient received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and cefepime for antibiotic prophylaxis. Nine days later, the patient was discharged with referrals to physical therapy and the appropriative postoperative wound care instructions.
The patient was treated with chemotherapy for five months postoperatively and responded well. Since finishing chemotherapy treatments, the patient has continued with physical therapy and has been fitted for a lower extremity prosthetic. Postoperative radiographs have demonstrated appropriate healing of the rotationplasty (). Six-month postoperative Positron Emission Tomography (PET) showed no evidence of local or distant metastatic disease. There was minimal uptake in the left lower extremity at the location of the rotationplasty. The procedure with the appropriate adjuvant chemotherapy was deemed successful.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 51-year-old cirrhotic man presented with abdominal pain for one day. He then had a sudden upper gastrointestinal bleeding and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated that a ruptured SAA located near to splenic hilum and formation of hematoma in left epigastric region (). Further ultrasonography confirmed liver cirrhosis and ascites. He underwent an urgent laparotomy. After dissection of severely adhered tissues, a pulsatile mass approximate 4.8 cm×5.6 cm×4.9 cm was found closely adhensive to stomach and splenic hilum.

"The patient was a 45-year-old man who presented with a headache for 3 months which was progressive and had been intolerable for 2 weeks. However, the patient was a football player with good health. There was no such family history and family members were perfectly well. There were no other clinical symptoms reported by the patient.
The patient was advised to do CT-scan and MRI. Interestingly both CT-scan and MRI revealed brilliantly enhancing left lateral ventricular lesion with unilateral hydrocephalus (). T1 Image axial view postcontrast () and precontrast film () were also examined. T1 image of coronal view in postcontrast film was also evaluated (). T2 image in sagittal view () also found the SOL.
Flare image () was examined as well. All other investigations were within normal limit. Then the patient was advised for surgery for removal of the lesion. In this context, left parietal craniotomy was performed with total removal of the lesion through intraparietal approach. Reversal from GA and the postoperative period was uneventful and the patient had got rid of clinical symptom completely after surgery.
The tumor was well defined preoperatively and was removed under microscopic surgery meticulously. The patient was very poor to bear the cost of postoperative CT-scan and hence it was not done. The biopsy was sent for histopathological examination. The lesion was nearly spherical measuring 3.0 cm + 2.5 cm, whitish, and firm.
There was no evidence of necrosis. Microscopy revealed multicystic appearance with cyst lined by columnar epithelium with apical mucin. Few goblet cells were seen. Few areas had shown pseudostratified lining epithelium with nuclear hyperchromasia, nuclear enlargement, and increased mitosis.
There was no evidence of stromal invasion. The mucinous material was seen within the lumen. Hemosiderin laden macrophages were present in the stroma. It was confirmed as a lateral ventricular enterogenous cyst. Then the patient was well in around one year. After about one year of the surgical removal of the lesion, there was a recurrence of a headache whose intensity was more than the previous one.
Then the patient was advised to do a CT-scan which revealed lesion of the same pattern in the same location as before (). The patient was reexplored surgically and the tumor was removed completely through the same route and histopathology was again revealed it as a case of the enterogenous cyst. Again the total removal of the lesion from the brain was confirmed by postoperative CT-scan. Then the patient was advised for radiotherapy. After completion of radiotherapy, the patient was perfectly well at 13th postoperative month ().","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 10-year-old male patient was referred to orthodontic traction of an impacted right lower first molar (tooth 46). During clinical examination, no alteration was noted except the absence of tooth 46. No abnormalities were detected in previous medical history. A cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) showed the presence of a radiolucent image measuring <1 cm located between teeth 46 and 48, which was initially interpreted as a dental germ (). The patient was submitted to surgery under local anesthesia to achieve tooth crown exposure and bonding of an orthodontic device to traction of its right lower first molar. Six months after the procedure, in a routine panoramic radiograph during orthodontic treatment, a well-defined radiolucent image with radiopaque foci was identified in the region of the suggestive dental germ. Additionally, an increasing volume with cortical expansion and fenestration was observed in a CBCT investigation ().
Thereby, a provisional diagnostic hypothesis of odontogenic lesions was made, suggesting adenomatoid odontogenic tumor and COC. The chosen clinical conduct was the surgical enucleation of the lesion. A straight incision was made in the alveolar ridge with flap detachment to facilitate access to the lesion, and an aspiration puncture was performed revealing a liquid content (). During surgery, the lesion was completely detached from the mandibular bone, allowing visualization of a capsule with a cystic aspect (). The specimen was sent for histopathologic examination, and the microscopic findings revealed a cystic cavity lined by a thin odontogenic epithelium with ameloblastomatous features. Ghost cells and calcification foci were also observed. Furthermore, the formation of dentinoid matrix, immature enamel, and fibrous connective tissue was noticed. Therefore, the diagnosis of COC associated with odontoma was established (Figures and 3(b)). One year later, no signs of recurrence were observed and a CBCT revealed new bone formation in the region (). Currently, the patient is undergoing clinical and radiographic follow-up with pediatric dentistry specialists and orthodontists for adequate establishment of occlusal dynamics.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"In 1998, a 20-year-old male was admitted to the General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University (Tianjin, China) with symptoms of dizziness, unsteadiness and nausea for three weeks, as well as vomiting for one week. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a mass in the cerebellar vermis and surgery was performed to excise the tumor. The pathological examination identified a hemangioblastoma. Three years later, the patient was readmitted to hospital due to dizziness lasting for one week. An MRI examination showed recurrence of the hemangioblastoma in the cerebellum and the patient underwent surgery to resect the tumor. In April 2012, the patient was readmitted to hospital for the third time due to jaundice. An enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed multiple RCCs in the kidneys, and a nodule with a rich blood supply in the pancreatic head. In addition, numerous cysts were identified throughout the pancreas (). These observations were confirmed by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, which revealed that the nodule in the pancreatic head was ~2.9×2.2 cm in size and possibly a NET. Due to the size and location of the tumor, the bile duct in the pancreas was compressed and the upper parts of the common bile and hepatic ducts were dilated. Since it was not possible to excise the RCCs, the patient also refused surgery to resect the pancreatic head mass. A metallic stent was placed at the stenosis site of the common bile duct, which alleviated the jaundice ( and ). Nine months later, the patient returned to the hospital with a fever, abdominal pain and jaundice. An enhanced abdominal CT was performed, which revealed no change in the size of the pancreatic head mass. The patient’s symptoms were relieved following anti-inflammatory therapy for one week. However, the patient continued to suffer the same symptoms every two months, and gradually, anti-inflammatory therapy failed to alleviate the symptoms. Radiography tests revealed complete blockage of the stent and thus, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTCD) surgery was performed.
Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood leukocytes and polymerase chain reaction was performed. Direct sequencing revealed a known mutation of a base pair change at nucleotide 473 in exon 3 (T473T/C) of the VHL gene, resulting in the amino acid change Leu158Pro.
There was a recorded family history of VHL disease, with the patient’s mother, grandmother, two uncles and three aunts also suffering from the disease. Additionally, one uncle had succumbed to RCC and five other individuals in the family had succumbed to cerebral hemangioblastomas.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year. Exclusion Criteria: Younger than 65 years old, having decompensated liver disease, psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance, having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy.",1
"A 26 year old South-Asian female, having irregular menstrual cycles but was otherwise healthy presented with fever to the accident & emergency unit with severe generalized myalgia and arthralgia. Clinical assessment revealed a tachycardia with a pulse rate of 108 b.p.m and an initial blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg, indicating shock. Clinical picture favored dengue fever with the classic repertoire of symptoms. Since the patient had taken mefenamic acid, a non steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) for myalgia for a few days, her complaint of fever for only one day at presentation suggested an erroneous timeline and a late presentation. Rest of the systemic examination was normal and clinically there was no evidence of leakage of fluid in the chest and abdomen on presentation. She was started immediately on an intravenous infusion of 0.9% saline. Preliminary whole blood analysis demonstrated a low haematocrit of 32% with a reduced haemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL (11–17) and a platelet count of 173 × 10 9/L (150–450). Despite fluid replacement her blood pressure declined to 80/40 mmHg with development of shock together with a reduction of the haematocrit to 29%. At this stage haemorrhagic shock was suspected on a background of NSAID usage. She was transfused with cross matched packed red cells urgently and stabilization of the haemodynamic parameters were noted with a borderline but stable blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg. Haematocrit also stabilized at 35%. An ultra sound scan failed to reveal either leakage of fluid into pleural cavity or the presence of ascitic fluid and intra-abdominal heaemorrhage. However the patient suffered heavy per vaginal bleeding which continued. She was observed in a high dependency setting and 8 hours after admission and clinical stabilization, she developed bradycardia, which was confirmed on electrocardiogram (ECG). In addition to sinus bradycardia, the ECG showed T wave inversions from V2- V5 (Figure ). Cardiac insult due to dengue virus infection was suspected, although creatine kinase-MB was normal and Troponin I remained negative. ECG was done serially to monitor the progression and on the second day of hospitalization revealed the occurrence of complete heart block with atrio-ventricular dissociation and a junctional rhythm with a short P-R interval (Figure ). Despite this, the blood pressure remained within acceptable safe limits. In view of satisfactory peripheral perfusion a clinical decision was made not to insert a temporary pacemaker, but to continue close observation for possible haemodynamic compromise occurring due to arrhythmia or worsening due to its presence.
Primary dengue virus infection was confirmed by the presence of positive IgM antibodies with negative IgG antibodies on day 2 of hospitalization. Platelet counts on day 2 of hospitalsation was 157 ×109/L(150–450), but haematocrit value started to rise to 42 and then 45 within a few hours, and clinical examination revealed a right sided pleural effusion which was confirmed on sonographic imaging with the presence of pleural fluid and additionally fluid in the hepatorenal pouch. Fluid resuscitation and replacement was carried out in accordance with the national guidelines on dengue management. Serum magnesium levels were within reference range, with a value of 2.07 mg/dL (1.58-2.55). Serum sodium and potassium values were within reference throughout her stay. Initial serum ionized calcium levels were found to be low normal with a value of 1.14 mmol/L(1.12-1.32) Subsequent ionized calcium levels were found reduced to a value of 1 mmol/L (1.12-1.32). In the background of ECG changes, hypocalcemia was corrected cautiously with intravenous calcium gluconate and the electrolytes were monitored regularly, though the cardiac rhythm remained unchanged. Post correction serum ionized calcium was 1.17 mmol/L and later 1.22 mmol/L (1.12-1.32). Two dimensional echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 50% with normal valves, normal sized atria and ventricles with no systolic wall motion abnormalities though myocardial depression was observed. Liver function tests revealed elevated enzymes. Aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase were 141U/L (<40) and 119 U/L (<40) respectively and later rose to the highest recorded value of 320 U/L(<40) and 187U/L (<40) respectively. Gamma GT was also elevated at 347.5 U/L (7–50). Total protein was normal with a value of 62.4 g/L (60–85) but albumin was marginally reduced to 30.9 g/L (35–54). The patient remained clinically stable but the persistence of bleeding prompted a blood picture analysis to identify and exclude features of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Blood picture revealed moderately low platelets and reactive lymphocytes but no features of DIC. However thromboelastography revealed hypocoagulation, platelet deficiency and fibrinogen deficiency. In light of low platelets (lowest nadir of 10x109/L) and continuous per vaginal bleeding 4 units of factor VII complex was given. Normal sinus rhythm was noted on day 5 of admission, though she remained bradycardic till the time of discharge from hospital.
The bleeding ceased and platelet counts rose gradually. The patient made good clinical recovery with the pleural effusion subsiding and vaginal bleeding ceasing. ECG showed resolution upon review two weeks later.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 25-year-old male presented at our clinics for a right shoulder pain related to a dorsal scapular mass first observed 4 months earlier. The main symptom was a shoulder discomfort when lying on his back, sometimes compromising the sleep. The patient also complained of some weakness when using his right arm under the shoulder level. The medical history consisted in a unique kidney and past treatments for a nodular sclerosis-subtype Hodgkin lymphoma (chemotherapy and radiotherapy, last treatment twelve years ago and no recurrence).
The physical examination revealed a nonmobile 3 cm T × 3 cm AP × 2 cm CC hard mass on the posterior superomedial angle of the right scapula, sensitive to palpation (). Muscle trophicity was symmetrical. The right shoulder presented a full range of motion in all directions without scapulothoracic dyskinesis. Weakness and pain were observed when raising the right shoulder or during active abduction (at all levels).
A right shoulder radiological series including AP, lateral, and Neer views was described normal and conducted additional investigations. A thoracic computed tomography was performed and described a 2.6 cm T × 2.6 cm AP × 2.2 cm CC solid bone mass at the posterior aspect of the superomedial angle of the scapula. The diagnosis of an osteochondroma without signs of malignancy was stated (). No adenopathy or recurrence of the past Hodgkin lymphoma was observed. Retrospectively, the mass was apparent on the shoulder Neer view. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including the right shoulder and scapula confirmed the benign character of the osteochondroma. The accessory nerve (XI) was compressed between the osteochondroma and the deep layer of the trapezius; no muscle atrophy was described ().
The osteochondroma was surgically removed under general anesthesia. The patient was prone, and a 10 cm incision was centered on the mass. The trapezius muscle was split at its superior part at the level of the scapula spine. The accessory nerve was visualized and protected in the deep layer of the trapezius muscle. The osteochondroma was exposed and resected from the supraspinatous fossa with an osteotome. The mass was perfectly smooth and measured 3 cm T × 3 cm AP × 2 cm CC (). The integrity of the accessory nerve was checked before closure. The histopathologic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of a benign osteochondroma ().
The shoulder was immobilized in a sling 10 days for wound care. Free mobilization was then granted. No physiotherapy was needed.
The patient was followed annually up to 3 years. He regained full shoulder range of motion and complete symmetric trapezius and rotator cuff strength. The patient has no clinical and radiological recurrence of the osteochondroma.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 54-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to chronic, long-standing type II diabetes mellitus presented in January 2011 with decreased urine output and swelling over the whole body for 3 months. He was trained for CAPD in a stable state of health. The patient was compliant with medical care and had been free from peritonitis to date. However, he presented to the nephrology outpatient department in January 2013 with complaints of fever, abdominal pain and cloudy PD effluent. As the abdominal pain worsened, the patient was admitted to the hospital. The patient denied any contact with soil or plant material. His past medical history was uneventful except for diabetes mellitus for the past 11 years. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 140/80 mm Hg−1, temperature 100.8 ° F, pulse 72 min−1 and respiration rate 18 min−1. His head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination was unremarkable. There was no clubbing, cyanosis, lymphadenopathy or icterus. His lungs were clear and no cardiac murmur was heard. His abdomen was tender in all quadrants with rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were present and active. Pertinent laboratory values were Hgm (Hemoglobin) 7.2 gm dl−1, white blood cells (WBCs) 24000 mm−3, platelets 2.28×105 µl−1, serum creatinine 9.3 mg dl−1, serum blood urea nitrogen 45 mg dl−1, serum uric acid 4.9 mg dl−1, serum sodium 131 mmol l−1, serum potassium 3.5 mmol l−1, serum albumin 3.3 g dl−1, serum bilirubin (total) 0.45 mg dl−1, serum aspartate transaminase 19 U l−1, serum alanine aminotransferase 13 U L−1, serum alkaline phosphatase 105 U l−1, serum amylase 29 U L−1, serum calcium 8.9 mg dl−1, serum phosphorus 5 mg dl−1 and serum lactate dehydrogenase 514 U l−1. PD fluid was sent for cell count, Gram stain and culture. The WBC count in PD fluid was 6400 mm−3 with 82% neutrophils. Gram staining of the fluid showed plenty of Gram-negative bacilli. A presumptive diagnosis of CAPD peritonitis was made and empiric intraperitoneal cefazolin and tobramycin were started. PD fluid culture yielded catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, non-spore-forming and non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli. The isolate was positive for urea hydrolysis and nitrate reduction. Negative reactions were found for the production of H2S, indole, lysine decarboxylase and ornithine decarboxylase for the hydrolysis of gelatin. The identity of the isolate was confirmed as R. radiobacter sensitive to trimethoprim/sulfametoxazole, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoperazone-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, imipinem and meropenem. It was resistant only to aztreonam. Empiric antibiotic therapy was continued and the patient’s abdominal pain subsided and the peritoneal fluid counts decreased to 50 WBCs mm−3 on day 4. However, on the eighth hospital day, the patient again complained of abdominal pain and the PD fluid count increased to 300 WBCs mm−3. The catheter was therefore surgically removed and the tip sent for culture. The tip yielded growth of R. radiobacter.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 14-year-old girl with an uneventful clinical history suddenly developed a severe syndrome characterized by intermittent-remittent fever with spikes up to 41℃, headache, meningismus, drowsiness, myalgia, and arthralgia without arthritis. A mild liver and spleen enlargement was present.
Routine investigations showed increased acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], levels of 90 mm/h; C-reactive protein [CRP], 14.7 mg/dl), anemia [hemoglobin 9.6 g/dl], total white cell count 6.4 × 103/µL, thrombocytopenia [128 × 103/µL], and liver involvement [aspartate transaminase 322 UI/L, alanine transaminase 485 UI/L, and γ-GT 295 UI/L]). Serology for some hepatotropic viruses (i.e. hepatitis viruses A-B-C, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus) was negative. The autoantibody panel showed a slight autoantibody positivity of anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA) (1:40) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) with an atypical pattern.
Due to the increased transaminase and γ-GT plasma levels a liver biopsy was performed with the results being consistent with a non-specific hepatitis pattern. Moreover, brain MRI, cerebrospinal fluid analysis and bacterial culture ruled out encephalo-meningitis; bone marrow biopsy and bone scintigraphy were also negative. Antibiotics treatment (amoxicillin-clavulanate 90 mg/kg/day three times a day) was started without significant clinical response. Since fever spikes and myalgia/arthralgia persisted, the girl was admitted to our department 30 days after disease onset.
At admission, the patient complained of recurrent fever spikes and severe malaise, although according to the parents’ opinion the general conditions of the girl had been ameliorated. Laboratory investigations showed positive acute phase reactants (ESR 75 mm/h and CRP 3.9 mg/dl), hypergammaglobulinemia (1.73 g/dl) with increased IgM (241 mg/dl) and IgA (490 mg/dl) plasma concentrations: notably, transaminase activities were normal with persistently increased γ-GT 114 UI/L. As a diagnosis had not yet been reached, we performed a WB-MRI on a 1.5 T MRI scanner (Achieva Intera; Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) using body coil with a field of view covering from head to toes. WB-MRI images were acquired (and displayed) in coronal plane using a turbo spin echo T1-weighted (T1W) sequence (TR, 630 ms; TE, 17 ms; slice thickness, 5 mm; gap, 0.5 mm; NSA, 1) and a turbo spin echo STIR sequence (TR, 2800 ms; TE, 165 ms; TI, 64 ms; slice thickness, 5 mm; gap, 0.5 mm; NSA, 3). Total scan time was about 30 min. No contrast medium was administered during the examination.
The MR investigation was carried out with the aim to rule out hemato-oncologic diseases and occult abscess. Surprisingly the WB-MRI showed an unusual pattern characterized by millimetric, widespread punctate nodules, respectively hypo-hyperintense in T1W and STIR sequences. These nodules were mainly localized in the meta-epiphyseal regions of the long bones of both legs (mostly at the level of the distal femur and proximal tibia) as further documented by an additional dedicated MRI of both knees (, , , and ). According to the radiologist’s opinion, these images were possibly related to a hematologic intramedullary spread of an infectious process or to a post-infectious thrombotic microangiopathy.
Upon this finding, and taking into account the apparent self-limiting disease course and the rural area where the patient lived, further investigations were conducted to rule out zoonosis. Serologic assay of anti-Anaplasma phagocytophilum showed an IgM titer of 1:40 (positive, >1:64) and an IgG titer of 1:160 (positive, >1:64). Hence intravenous ceftriaxone treatment (80 mg/kg daily) was started with a prompt clinical improvement (i.e. disappearance of fever, myalgia, malaise, and headache). The patient has not had a relapse after about 1 year of treatment.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 26-year-old man arrived at the emergency department with a seven-day history of hematemesis and melena. He had no previous medical history and did not drink alcohol or used any illicit drug or medication.
Physical examination on admission showed blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg, a temperature of 36°C (96.8°F), a pulse rate of 90/min, and a respiratory rate of 22/min; his height was 1.75 m, weight 98 kg, and BMI 32 kg/m2. He experienced pain with deep palpation in the epigastrium and no organomegaly or lymphadenopathy was identified. The left scrotal sac was enlarged and indurated and there was a mass in the left scrotum that was indistinguishable from the left testis and provoked displacement of structures of the penis and right testis (the right scrotum was empty). No inguinal lymphadenopathy was identified.
Laboratory tests revealed normal liver function. Hemoglobin was 9.13 g/dl, MCV was 87.9 fL, WBC was 11.9 K/uL, neutrophils were 9.81 K/uL, lymphocyte count was 1.59 K/uL, and platelet level was 252 K/uL. Serum glucose level was 106 mg/dl, BUN was 38 mg/dl, creatinine was 0.9 mg/dl, and calcium was 8.9 mg/dl. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was 17,090 ng/mL, lactate dehydrogenase was 1480 U/L (normal range: 91–180 IU/L), and human chorionic gonadotropin level was 287.4 IU/mL.
After resuscitation with crystalloid solutions, he underwent upper endoscopy. The gastroenterologist found abundant active bleeding, for which orotracheal intubation was decided to provide airway protection. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. A second upper endoscopy revealed a type 1 isolated gastric varix, treated with cyanoacrylate without complications ().
A scrotal US showed a large heterogeneous image in the left testicle area, with an echogenic and cystic solid component and flow presence with color Doppler assessment.
A contrasted CT scan of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis showed a liver of normal size and density with multiple retrocrural, retroperitoneal, mesenteric, and left iliac metastatic lymphadenopathy which caused extrinsic compression of the portal vein along with splenic vein partial thrombosis with left-sided portal hypertension and perigastric and perisplenic collateral neovascularization (). A heterogeneous, well defined mass was found in the left testicle, 16.7 × 16.1 × 14.9 cm, with a solid component that was enhanced with the administration of contrast, as well as a cystic component. There was also invasion of the left spermatic cord.
The patient was extubated after surveillance and transferred to the Internal Medicine Department. We started chemotherapy with etoposide 100 mg/m2 and cisplatin 20 mg/m2, and seven days later the patient underwent a left radical orchiectomy by an inguinal approach with left hemiscrotectomy, without complications. Following this intervention, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was reduced to 350 ng/mL, and the human chorionic gonadotropin level was 50 IU/mL.
A postoperative biopsy showed a pure testicular teratoma () with glandular formations and the presence of cartilage (a) and respiratory epithelium, with ciliated columnar cells alternating with goblet cells (b).

"A 54-year-old woman presented to her personal physician and complained the pain on her right breast. She underwent a breast surgery in our hospital. The patient and her family’s medical histories were unremarkable.
The patient was 157 cm tall and weighed 53 kg. Physical examination of the right breast (area C) revealed an elastic hard mass measuring 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm. Margins were distinct, with relatively good mobility and a tumor-nipple distance of 3.2 cm. No axillary or cervical lymph nodes were palpable. Hematological and biochemical blood test results were normal. The levels of tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 15-3, and National Cancer Center-Stomach-439, were within normal limits.
Mammography revealed an indistinct margined hyper dense mass in the right outer portion, which was assessed as Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System category 4C (: MLO view, : CC view). Breast ultrasonography (US) revealed complex cystic lesion, and the tumor was large with 2.5 cm diameter (). Complex cystic lesion on US with blood content on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology revealed malignant cells. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and a T2 weight image revealed an early enhancement image with no intraductal spread (). No distant metastases was identified on computed tomography or bone scan. The tumor stage was T2N0M0. Breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed.
The results exposed two sentinel lymph nodes and no malignant cell. The tumor measured 2.0 cm in diameter and contained a central cystic area (,). Histopathological examination showed low papillary growth in the cystic cavity surface, which was covered by adenocarcinomatous components associated with some squamous metaplasia. Most of the lesions comprising the cyst wall were a mixture of irregular bundles of spindle-shaped tumor cells and fibrous connective tissue proliferation. The tumor was diagnosed as spindle cell ().
Immunostaining of spindle-shaped tumor cells showed positive results for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) and vimentin (,), partially positive results for s-100, and negative results for desmin and α-actin. The final histopathological diagnosis was spindle cell carcinoma. Histological grade from malignancy was grade III. Lymphatic invasion was negative, whereas blood vessel invasion was positive. Lymph node metastasis was negative, and p-stage I was diagnosed. Estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2), which showed negative results by biochemical tests, were called triple negative type in subtype classification. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient received six courses of FEC-100 chemotherapy. Radiotherapy included simultaneous integrated boost enforced 60 Gy (2 Gy/day) to the residual breast tissue.

"A 49-year-old woman presented with diarrhea approximately once every 30 min for two days prior to her visit. On arrival, she had a fever of 39.0°C with chills. The patient had persistent diarrhea and fever and had trouble moving; hence she required emergency assistance and was brought to our hospital. She was a current smoker, who smoked 10 cigarettes/day for 29 years and consumed 1,500 mL of cocktails per day. She owned a pet cat, and the cat licked her body surface regularly. She had a history of depression; however, she had not consulted a doctor for five years. She had no other medical history and was not taking any medications, including any over-the-counter medications.
Her height and body weight were 162 cm and 60 kg, respectively. On admission, consciousness was assessed using the Glasgow Coma Scale (score, 14) (E4V4M6), her body temperature was 38.0℃, pulse was 132 beats/min, blood pressure was 88/51 mmHg, respiratory rate was 24 breaths/min, and the peripheral arterial oxygen saturation was 94% (nasal cannula, 1 L). Physical examination revealed livedo reticularis on the lower limbs. There was no site of soft tissue infection with redness, heat, or swelling throughout the body. The blood tests that were performed are shown in Table . Arterial blood gas analysis showed mixed alkalosis and hyperlactatemia (serum lactate, 8.4 mg/dL). Conventional abdominal computed tomography revealed mild enlargement and a diffuse low-density area of the liver.
The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit in a state of septic shock with alcoholic cirrhosis, hypokalemia (serum potassium, 1.9 mEq/L) with frequent diarrhea, and disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome. The clinical course of the patients is shown in Figure . Blood, urine, and spinal fluid specimens were cultured, and piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g) was administered as an empiric therapy with the initiation of potassium replacement through a central vein. On the same day, the antibacterial agents were changed to meropenem (1 g every 12 h) and vancomycin (1.5 g every 24 h) due to deteriorating clinical conditions. Artificial respiration was started on the same day as the patient's respiratory condition worsened. After admission, she did not have frequent diarrhea. On the second day of admission, the patient’s renal function (serum creatinine, 2.6 mg/dL) and liver function (prothrombin time, 35.6%; total bilirubin, 6.0 mg/dL) worsened, thereby requiring continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF), plasma exchange therapy, and coagulation factor replacement. In addition, venoglobulin and amikacin 400 mg were administered for sepsis. The dosage of meropenem was changed to a severe dose of 2 g every 12 h considering the worsening clinical condition and the dosage of vancomycin was changed to 1 g every 24 h as the renal function worsened and CHDF was initiated. However, metabolic acidosis and hyperlactatemia progressed, and the patient died in the early hours of the third sick day. On the third day of admission, blood culture yielded P. multocida, which was susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 68-year-old Caucasian woman recently diagnosed with CMML presented to our rheumatology office for evaluation of an abnormal chest computed tomography (CT) showing inflammation surrounding the entire thoracic and abdominal aorta. She was experiencing shortness of breath, fatigue, fevers, and night sweats for about four months previously. She additionally had an unintentional weight loss of 35 pounds over the past 2 years which was initially attributed to Nissen fundoplication procedure for gastroesophageal reflux. She denied any headaches, vision changes, scalp tenderness, jaw pain, dysphagia, joint pain, joint swelling, muscle pain, or photosensitivity.
For the past eight months, she had been undergoing hematological workup of abnormal blood counts. Her white blood cell (WBC) counts were elevated with monocytosis and varying degrees of neutrophilia over the past 3 years. She had thrombocytosis. Her initial evaluation was negative for BCR-ABL PCR testing, Janus kinase-2, calreticulin, and MPL mutations. There was no hepatosplenomegaly on imaging. After these tests returned negative, she was planned for a bone marrow biopsy for further evaluation of monocytosis but opted to wait as she was asymptomatic. However, she presented back with a nontender, erythematous lesion on her left breast. About two weeks later, similar scattered pink small dermal papulonodules were present on the posterior neck, left shoulder, abdomen, and left thigh. Left breast punch biopsy described a dense dermal infiltrate with small lymphocytes with cytologic atypia. There was no significant epidermal involvement. The lymphocytes were positive for CD4 and CD43, myeloperoxidase, and lysozyme. The overall morphologic and immunohistochemical findings were those of a malignant neoplasm. Although this was originally thought to be a possible T cell lymphoma, case was discussed at the hematopathology conference and the overall presentation correlated with more systemic process, such as CMML.
Subsequent bone marrow biopsy and aspiration showed pieces of hypercellular bone marrow with overall cellularity of 50%, trilineage hematopoiesis, hypogranular myeloid cells, and increase of monocytoid cells with somewhat immature appearing features. Increased monocytosis (20%) with oval-shaped, slightly irregular nuclei was present. There was no evidence of fibrosis on reticulin staining. Adequate megakaryopoiesis and erythropoiesis without dysplastic changes was noted. The myeloid-to-erythroid ratio was mildly increased. Cytogenetic evaluation exhibited a normal karyotype (46, XX). Flow cytometry revealed CD14+/CD16- monocytes that are characteristic of CMML []. CMML diagnosis was made based on the above findings, persistent peripheral blood monocytosis ≥ 1 × 109/L, with monocytes accounting for ≥10% of the WBC count, no evidence of PDGFRA/PDGFRB, <20% blasts in the blood and bone marrow, not meeting WHO criteria for BCR-ABL1 positive chronic myeloid leukemia, primary myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, or essential thrombocytosis and all other causes of monocytosis excluded []. For staging, she underwent positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) scans and both imaging studies showed soft tissue density surrounding the entirety of the thoracic and abdominal aorta, consistent with large-vessel vasculitis (see Figures and ).
Laboratory studies were positive for antinuclear antibody (ANA) with a titer of 1 : 640 in a nucleolar and speckled pattern as well as elevated RNP antibody (ab) at 1.1. Her inflammatory markers were elevated: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 36 mm/hr and C-reactive protein (CRP) 35.3 mg/L. The negative serologies included an anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic ab, anti-proteinase 3 ab, anti-myeloperoxidase ab, SS-A/SS-B ab, anti-Smith ab, anti-dsDNA ab, anti-smooth muscle ab, rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide ab, and hepatitis panel.
For symptomatic aortitis, we started treatment with prednisone 1 mg/kg/day. Within a week, patient had significant improvement. Her shortness of breath subsided and she felt strong and energetic. Objectively, while on steroid therapy, her WBC count initially dropped. Since the aortitis related symptoms were improving, the hematology team planned to start her on treatment with a hypomethylating agent—azacitidine.
Steroid therapy was slowly tapered given her good response to initial high-dose steroids. However, two months later, she developed steroid-induced myopathy and prednisone was tapered more quickly. Within two weeks, she became more dyspneic and hypoxic. Her respiratory status deteriorated quickly, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. She was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible infectious etiology. CT chest demonstrated stable aortitis but increased diffuse ground-glass opacity throughout both lungs and bilateral pulmonary consolidation. These findings were attributed to paraneoplastic infiltrates from leukemia and less likely to be infectious. Cultures from bronchoalveolar lavage and Pneumocystis jirovecii testing were negative. Coincidentally, prior to this admission, she had a stable WBC count of 18,600/μL that now has progressed to WBC count of 77,000/μL, despite negative infectious workup, aortitis being asymptomatic and stable on CT imaging study.
Given her clinical deterioration from leukemia, in her final days she received her first treatment of CMML with hydroxyurea, then underwent leukapheresis, and received one dose of chemotherapy with decitabine one day prior to expiration. Unfortunately, she continued to deteriorate and was placed on hospice. Her family refused an autopsy.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 61-year-old woman was referred by another institution with a diagnosis of distal transverse colon invasive adenocarcinoma and resectable liver metastases. Her past medical history revealed type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. No relevant family history was noted. The case was discussed at the multidisciplinary tumor board meeting, and the decision was taken for the patient to undergo surgery for the primary tumor and subsequently address the treatment of liver metastases. A laparoscopic-assisted transverse colectomy with primary anastomosis was performed with no intraoperative complications. On the fourth postoperative day, she developed tachypnea, fever, and leukocytosis. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen with contrast was carried out. This showed a right middle lobe opacification consistent with pneumonia. A small <5 cm localized pelvic collection was noted; otherwise, the intra-abdominal organs including the spleen were unremarkable (). Blood cultures were negative. Conservative treatment with intravenous ciprofloxacin was initiated. Her condition slowly improved. However, three days later, she developed severe metabolic acidosis due to acute renal failure. She was shifted to the ICU and underwent urgent hemodialysis. Four days after starting hemodialysis, she complained of acute left upper abdominal pain and developed hypovolemic shock.
Laboratory investigations showed normochromic normocytic anemia (hemoglobin 8.7 g/dL (12-17), white cell count 20.8 × 109/L (4-11), platelet count 517 × 109/L (150-400), blood urea nitrogen 12.9 mmol/L (2.7-7.2), and creatinine 342 μmol/L (53-97)). Liver function tests showed an albumin of 14 g/L (34-50), alkaline phosphatase of 225 μ/L (54-144), prothrombin time of 16.1 (9.6-12.6), partial thromboplastin time of 36 sec. (24.3-30.2), and international normalized ratio of 1.5 (0.8-1.2).
Blood gases revealed a pH of 7.15 (7.3-7.4), pCO2 of 27 mmHg (36-46), HCO3 of 18.5 mmol/L (21-28), lactate of 1.5 mmol/L (0.5-1), and anion gap of 24.2.
A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a large subcapsular splenic hematoma with gas formation. There was no evidence of bowel perforation or obstruction ().
An emergency laparotomy was performed, and this showed a ruptured splenic hematoma. Peritoneal lavage and splenectomy were performed. Histology showed a necrotic spleen with fibrin and focal fat necrosis with no evidence of malignancy.
The patient made a slow but uneventful recovery and was eventually transferred to the nephrology unit to continue treatment for renal failure.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 37-year-old African American female with a history of two unprovoked deep venous thromboses (DVT) treated with apixaban was evaluated for a pruritic rash of two weeks' duration. She had started apixaban two months prior to the rash onset; there were otherwise no changes in her medication regimen. The exam showed hyperpigmented brown scaly plaques with central atrophic patches on the conchal bowl of the ears (Figure ), violaceous nodules, and indurated plaques with scattered flaccid vesicles on the medial thighs, knees, and antecubital fossae (Figures , ), and eroded plaques with dry, serosanguinous crust on the elbows. Vesicles were not appreciated on non-lesional skin and there was no mucosal involvement. She endorsed hematuria and weight loss but denied lesion photosensitivity. Laboratory analysis was significant for leukopenia (WBC of 3.4 thousands/μL), anemia (hemoglobin of 5.6 g/dL), and proteinuria. Serology was positive for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (>1:160), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), anti-Smith, anti-Ro/SSA, cardiolipin antibody, beta2 glycoprotein antibody, and low C3 and C4 complement.
A 4-mm punch biopsy of a representative lesion from the medial knee was performed. Histopathologic findings suggested early SCLE and consisted of basilar vacuolar degeneration with scant dermal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate (Figure ). Colloidal iron staining highlighted mucin deposition throughout the superficial and deep dermis (Figure ). Apixaban was discontinued and warfarin initiated. Triamcinolone 0.01% was used as needed for her skin. She remains in remission at her three-month follow-up, treated with hydroxychloroquine (200 mg BID), mycophenolate mofetil (1 gm BID), and prednisone (40 mg daily) for her SLE and lupus nephritis, respectively.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"Our patient was a 44-year-old woman who underwent proximal gastrectomy and bilateral truncal vagotomy for a gastric neuroendocrine tumor. Her immediate postoperative course was uneventful, and no surgical complications, such as anastomotic fistula, were observed. On the third postoperative day, she presented with abdominal discomfort and bloating, nausea and vomiting (Figure ). On the fourth postoperative day, the patient developed severe, watery diarrhea. Her blood pressure suddenly decreased to 60/38 mmHg for unknown reason. An examination revealed that her body temperature was 37.2°C, her pulse was increased at 126 beats/minute, her respiratory rate was 28 breaths/minute and her blood oxygen saturation was 86%. A complete blood count was obtained, and the results revealed a white blood cell count of 2.9 × 109/L with 83% neutrophils and 13% lymphocytes. Analysis of blood gas showed that the patient’s blood lactate level was 8.2 mmol/L and base excess was −9.2. Serum level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was 143.4 mg/L. Blood and urine were collected for bacterial culture, and both test results were negative. The patient was urgently transferred to the ICU. On the fifth postoperative day, her temperature rose to 39.6°C and her pulse rate was 145 beats/minute, and she developed respiratory distress (Additional file ). Endotracheal intubation was performed to allow mechanical ventilation (Figure ). Her degree of diarrhea was aggravated, with a passage of greenish, watery liquid exceeding 1,800 ml. Her white blood cell count had increased to 7.9 × 109/L, and the proportion of neutrophils had risen to 98%. Her platelet count had decreased, and a coagulation test showed a prolonged time to coagulation. Sulbactam, ornidazole, vecuronium, norepinephrine, hydrocortisone and intensive intravenous fluids were administered, owing to concern about septic shock []. The patient was then treated with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) via percutaneous access and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). During the following days, the patient’s vital signs and clinical condition gradually stabilized. VV-ECMO and CRRT were stopped on the 12th postoperative day, but the patient’s diarrhea did not shown any improvement. On the next day, her fever reoccurred, with a peak temperature of 38.7°C (Additional file ). Her white blood cell count rose further to 18.0 × 109/L with 89% neutrophils and 10% lymphocytes. Her blood cultures now yielded Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterococcus faecalis, revealing a polymicrobial sepsis. Multiple antibiotics, including imipenem, caspofungin, penicillin and/or linezolid, and even probiotic bifidobacteria, were administered. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) was performed on days 15 and 22 postsurgery, and no intraabdominal free fluid or abscesses was noted (Additional file and Additional file ). The therapeutic strategies with antibiotics and probiotic were continued until 28 days, when the patient still had a fever (38.3°C) and the volume of watery stools reached 2,855 ml. On that day, the patient’s blood culture grew Propionibacterium acnes. Her white blood cell count returned to normal, but her CRP level remained as high as 103.3 mg/L.

"A 78-year-old male presented to our hospital with a recent history of acute decompensated heart failure due to severe MR, based on long-standing ischaemic heart disease which had been treated by coronary bypass and implantable cardioverter defibrillator for secondary prevention. At presentation, an auscultatory examination revealed a holosystolic murmur of a grade IV/VI was audible at the left fifth mid-clavicular line with radiation to the left axilla. No peripheral oedema was documented. The exertional dyspnoea was graded in New York Heart Association functional Class II. Six-minute walk distance was 403 m. N-terminal pro brain-type natriuretic peptide was 990 ng/L (normal < 486 ng/L). The prescribed medication was torasemide 20 mg, bisoprolol 10 mg, and amlodipine 10 mg and dabigatran 150 mg.
Transoesophageal echocardiography demonstrated an A2 segment pseudo-prolapse with an eccentric MR jet to the posterior direction, which appeared to result from mitral annular enlargement due to left atrial dilatation (volume 49 mL/m2) with the anteroposterior diameter of 38 mm, but no relevant LV cavity enlargement with the end-diastolic diameter of 52 mm and the ejection fraction of 64% (). As a result, the coaptation angle of both leaflets increased to 148°, where the angles between the mitral annular plane and leaflets reduced to 21° as to the anterior leaflet, comparing the posterior leaflet with 28°, in absence of relevant apical leaflet tethering (coaptation depth 6 mm) (). A three-dimensional colour Doppler echocardiography revealed a large MR orifice area of 0.78 cm2 with the width of 17 mm ().
Due to a prohibitive risk for redo surgery, the local multidisciplinary heart team decided to treat the patient using TMVr. In consideration of pathoanatomy of MV and a regurgitation width of 17 mm, we selected the PASCAL® Transcatheter Valve Repair System (Edwards Life Scientific, Irvine, CA, USA). The PASCAL was placed successfully between segments A2 and P2 (). The target posterior leaflet showed a thick basal part of 12.1 mm and a thin distal part of 4.7 mm with a total of 16.8 mm. The clasped length was 9.1 mm (). After PASCAL release, the MR severity was reduced to mild (); however, an acute SLDA occurred 2 min later (). The posterior leaflet was shortened to 12.3 mm (), and the device was moving back and forth instable, while the residual MR remained unchanged because the large-profile device worked like as a central spacer for the coaptation defect (). The mean transmitral gradient was 2 mmHg after PASCAL implantation. Due to the limited MV orifice area for a second PASCAL device with device width of 10 mm, we decided to stabilize the PASCAL device and both leaflets by a MitraClip XTR® (Abbott Vascular Structural Heart, Menlo Park, CA) with a device width of 4 mm. After exchanging the guide catheters, the leaflets adjacent to the PASCAL device were captured by the MitraClip XTR (), in which the residual length of the posterior leaflet was 5.5 mm after closing the clip (). The PASCAL device was stabilized (, , Video S) and the residual MR remained mild with a mean transmitral gradient of 3 mmHg (). The patient was successfully discharged 2 days after the procedure with mild MR, stable devices implanted and no post-procedural mitral stenosis with the mean gradient of 4.7 mmHg.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year. Exclusion Criteria: Younger than 65 years old, having decompensated liver disease, psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance, having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy.",1
"A six-month-old Caucasian male with no significant past medical history presented to the pediatric emergency department for a chief complaint of frequent unusual eye movements as reported by the parents. The patient began having intermittent rotary nystagmus approximately three weeks ago, and since then it progressed and became more continuous, worsened by changes in position or flashing lights from toys brought in his visual field. The parents also noticed the patient sleeping more than usual, only staying awake for an hour at a time, and had a subsequent severe regression in milestones, with an inability to roll over or sit unsupported.
Initial workup in the emergency department included a CT brain without contrast, which showed evidence of thickening of the bilateral optic nerves with associated masses and diffuse bilateral ventriculomegaly (Figure ). This finding was concerning for possible bilateral optic pathway gliomas, at which point a dedicated MRI of the brain and orbits was recommended, along with further genetic workup for possible neurofibromatosis I.
MRI of the brain and orbits confirmed these findings, showing diffuse enlargement of the optic tracts extending from the lateral geniculate nuclei to the optic chiasm and into the bilateral optic nerves, with a mass demonstrating 270º encasement of the bilateral supraclinoid internal carotid arteries and near circumferential encasement of the bilateral A1 segments of the anterior cerebral arteries (Figures , ).
These imaging findings confirmed the suspicion of bilateral optic pathway glioma, and as a result, the patient was admitted to the hospital and evaluated by both neurosurgery and pediatric hematology-oncology. Neurosurgery did not recommend any surgical intervention at the time, and the hematology-oncology team recommended proceeding with chemotherapy. His genetic testing results showed no evidence of clinically significant variants of neurofibromatosis I or II, suggesting a sporadic bilateral optic pathway glioma. The patient was then discharged and was followed up on an outpatient basis by both ophthalmology and pediatric hematology-oncology for maintenance chemotherapy with carboplatin and vincristine.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 16 days old newborn female from Saudi Arabia was presented to the clinic with a skin defect localized on the scalp since birth. The baby did not suffer from any ailments, and her medical history was unremarkable. Her mother, 32 years old, denied any history of illnesses during her pregnancy, infection or drug intake taking including Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID) or methimazole. She completed 38 weeks of gestation, and delivered her baby via a normal vaginal delivery.
The newborn did not sustain any birth injury and did not suffer from any other abnormalities or feeding difficulties. She did not require any intensive care, and went home from hospital with her mother. Upon local examination, the defect was solitary, localized with an irregular shape and approximately 6×6 cm in size (). The lesion involved the epidermis and the upper dermis only. Neurosurgical team was involved in the care of this patient. A CT Scan of the head was performed, and no deep tissue involvement was noted.
Reconstruction solutions were offered to the parents but they insisted on non-surgical intervention. Therefore, the patient was treated with non-invasive debridement of the lesion and local therapy, including gentle water cleansing and the application of topical antibiotic ointment. 6 months later, the patient has returned for a follow up. Scar tissue has formed over the defect (). Family history revealed that none of her parents had the same condition; however, two of her sisters did, and were diagnosed with cutis aplasia. The elder one is currently 4 years of age, with right unilateral terminal reduction of the first and second toes (). The other sister was born prematurely and died shortly after birth due to cardiac anomalies.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 32-year-old Caucasian male presented to the Ophthalmology Service at the Rocky Mountain
Regional Veterans Affairs Medical Center for evaluation of several months of bilateral eye
redness and blurry vison. Review of systems was notable for simultaneous onset of diffuse
erythema, tenderness, induration, and pruritus of a large black ink tattoo over the right
arm and chest (). This
tattoo was inked 1 year prior to presentation. He had 2 other tattoos completed 10 years
before, which were unaffected ().
At the time of initial presentation, ophthalmological examination with slit lamp revealed
anterior chamber inflammation and iris synechiae. On optical coherence tomography, there was
evidence of macular edema (). Skin examination was significant for inflammation, induration, and scant
desquamation in a pattern that closely matched the borders of the tattoo. Lungs were clear
to auscultation. The rest of the history and physical examination was unremarkable.
No clinical or serological evidence for other uveitis-associated diseases was elicited,
including infections, sarcoidosis, or spondylarthritis. Comprehensive metabolic panel,
complete blood count, urinalysis, thyroid stimulating hormone, free T4, ferritin, creatine
phosphokinase, and aldolase tests were within normal limits. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
was 13 mm/h, and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme concentration was 86 U/L (14-82).
C-reactive protein, HLA-B27, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody
(including cytoplasmic, perinuclear, and atypical ANCA), lysozyme, QuantiFERON, HIV,
hepatitis B and C serologies, rheumatoid factor, anticyclic citrullinated peptide
antibodies, and computed tomography of the chest were all within normal limits. Punch
biopsies of the affected skin were obtained. Histological examination revealed granulomatous
inflammation with associated tattoo ink deposition consistent with foreign body-type
granulomatous reaction ().
Melan A immunostain highlighted scattered single junctional benign melanocytes with control
samples staining appropriately.
The patient was initially treated with topical ocular glucocorticoids without significant
improvement. He then required oral methylprednisolone 24 mg daily, tapered to 4 mg daily
over 6 days. This agent led to rapid resolution of the inflammatory tattoo changes, but not
of the macular and optic disc edema. A sub-tenon’s triamcinolone injection to both eyes
resolved his ocular manifestation; however, tapering of his systemic glucocorticoids caused
his tattoo manifestations to reappear. Adalimumab at 40 mg subcutaneously every other week
satisfactorily terminated all of his symptoms. Unfortunately, after 3 months of therapy,
patient developed an injection site reaction. Certolizumab 200 mg SQ every 2 weeks was
instituted. A follow-up examination 4 months later revealed minimal, if any, subtle
inflammation in both eyes, mild worsening of the macular edema in his left eye, and visual
acuity of 20/20 by Snellen chart.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 28-year-old male was transferred to our hospital in November 2006 because of a sudden onset of cramping and abdominal pain and intermittent melena for 4 days. Initially, he exhibited symptoms including generalized weakness, dizziness, and massive bloody stool passage. There was no significant past medical history of recent infection, inflammatory bowel disease, bleeding disorders, changes in bowel habits, significant weight loss, or tuberous sclerosis complex. The patient had no previous surgeries, and the family history was unremarkable. The patient's height was 180.2 cm, weight was 78.5 kg, blood pressure was 74/39 mm Hg, pulse rate was 122 beats/min, and temperature was 36.4°C. The physical examination revealed moderate distention and tenderness in the left lower quadrant with associated defense. On digital rectal examination, there was some gross blood mixed with soft stool and an empty ampulla. Laboratory data showed a white blood cell count of 17,120/mm3, hemoglobin level of 7.4 g/dL, hematocrit of 23.9%, and platelet count of 162,000/mm3. Other biochemical tests were normal. The serum carcinoembryonic antigen level was normal.
The gastroscopic evaluation was normal. The full colonoscopy revealed a greater than 4.0 cm in diameter, large ulceration with an easy bleeding mass of the rectum lying beneath the mucosa but protruding into the lumen 15 cm from the anal verge (Fig. ). This tumor could not be classified by biopsy. However, on the basis of the immunohistopathological features, carcinoma and malignant lymphoma could be excluded. An abdominal enhanced CT scan revealed a heterogeneous mass lesion of approximately 8.9 x 7.2 cm in the pelvic floor at approximately the level of the rectum (Fig. ). A technetium-99m red blood cell scan showed no significant findings. Repeated attempts at endoscopic revaluation resulted in profuse bleeding requiring blood transfusions. A diagnostic biopsy failed before the surgical treatment due to bleeding from a light touch of the mass lesion
Given the difficulty of obtaining a diagnostic specimen, surgical resection and lower anterior resection were performed. On gross examination, the resected specimen was an 8.8 x 5.5 x 4.5 cm, tan, gray-white, soft, and well-circumscribed transmural mass of the rectum, mainly involving the muscularis propria and protruding into the tunica adventitia. The mucosa and submucosa were intact (Fig. ). The tumor protruded into the lumen, and the overlying mucosa showed ulceration. The tumor had a dark, red-grey, solid parenchyma with irregular cystic spaces with colorless serous liquid (Fig. ). The cut surface showed a yellowish-tan to gray-red solid parenchyma with focal irregular cystic spaces containing colorless serous fluid (Fig. ). All surgical margins were macroscopically free of tumor. No separate polyps were identified. Microscopically, the foci of hemorrhage and necrosis were present. The tumor extended through the muscularis propria into the subserosa tissue with lymphatic invasion. The colon mucosal tissue was composed of sheets with atypical glands with spindle-to-epithelioid cells and nuclear abnormalities in a tubular arrangement (Fig. ). Perivascular hyalinization was noted (Fig. ). Most tumor nuclei showed clear to granular, light, eosinophilic cytoplasm, and round to oval nuclei with distant small nucleoli pleomorphism (Fig. ). Less than 50% of the tumor area was necrotic. The mitotic rate was low. One of 27 accompanying serosal lymph nodes contained metastatic tumors that distended the subcapsular sinus. All of the surgical margins were free of tumor. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for melanoma-associated antigen (HMB-45) (Fig. ) but negative for cytokeratin, c-kit, synaptophysin, S-100, and actin. A diagnosis of metastatic PEComa was made after examination of the resection material.
Unfortunately, the patient did not complete the follow-up in the outpatient department after surgery because he relocated to another city to seek work. At the 49th month (2010) postoperatively, the patient returned to the clinic upon our scheduled request. An abdominal CT scan showed a 0.6 cm hypodense mass over the liver. He refused further evaluation and treatment. In July 2014, during the course of a required physical health check, he received an abdominal CT that showed that the original mass had increased from 0.6 to 1.5 cm and that the number of tumors had increased from 1 to 3 compared with the previous CT image in 2010. We noted that the distant liver metastasis progressed very slowly during the 4 years of follow-up. The liver function and the other serum tumor markers were normal upon examination. In August 2014, he underwent segmental hepatectomy (S3, S4A, S5, and S6) combined with wedge resection. The pathology report of segmental hepatectomy was metastatic PEComa.
This patient underwent 2 different surgical resections at 2 different times. He underwent the lower anterior resection of the PEComa of the rectum in 2006 and received the segmental hepatectomy in 2014. He is currently undergoing regular surveillance and has remained free of disease 28 months after the second operation. At the follow-up examination, the patient felt well, and the general clinical examination, subsequent colonoscopies, and abdominal CT scan once every 3 months revealed no significant findings after second operation in 2014. Since the primary surgery in 2006, there was also no recurrence of the PEComa of the rectum according to the general clinical examination, subsequent colonoscopies, and abdominal CT scan at the 120-month follow-up of the very first instance back in 2006.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 62-year-old female presented with chief complaints of floaters in the right eye (RE) for 3 weeks. She was a known diabetic (on OHD) since 6 years and hypertensive since 10 years (on treatment), rheumatoid arthritis (on treatment), and with no known adverse drug reactions. Her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 4/60 in RE and 6/6 in left eye (LE). On examination, her anterior segment revealed normal findings in both the eyes except for relative afferent pupillary defect in RE. Posterior segment revealed multiple intraretinal haemorrhages all over the superior quadrant, engorged tortuous blood vessels, and CME in RE while there was no abnormality in LE. A provisional diagnosis of RE hemicentral retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) with CME was made []. Her blood pressure was 160/90 mm of Hg, and her blood investigations showed deranged lipid profile and raised blood sugar. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a central macular thickness of 551 μ with intraretinal cystic spaces and fluid []. Fundus fluorescein angiography of RE revealed capillary dropouts and nonperfusion areas corresponding to the area of vein occlusion along with angiographic CME. She received a single intravitreal injection bevacizumab following which her vision improved to 6/36. Her OCT of RE revealed a full thickness MH a month later! [ and ] She was explained about requiring surgery. Over the next 18 months, she received 5 more injections of intravitreal Bevacizumab. Her RE BCVA before vitrectomy was 6/18. A 25G vitrectomy was performed and intraoperatively posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) had to be induced, conventional internal limiting membrane peeling done and a tamponade of C3F8 (perfluoropropane) was given. Four months postsurgery, her RE BCVA 6/24 with cataract formation and MH Type 1 (U-shaped) closure was seen [ and ]. In the subsequent months, she underwent cataract extraction following which she developed CME. She underwent scatter laser (sectoral superior quadrant) in her RE along with intravitreal injection Ranibizumab three times. She has remained in regular follow-ups ever since and her BCVA has remained stable at 6/9 [].","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 44-year-old, right-handed female presented with sudden hand motor deficits in her left hand. There was no trauma to the arm, she used no medications and she had no vascular risk factors.
Examination revealed severe motor deficits of the left hand with extension of the three ulnar fingers and wrist, muscle atrophy in the first dorsal interosseous muscle, and claw hand deformity without sensory deficits (Fig. ). According to the Medical Research Council scale examination revealed grade 1 in the left wrist flexor, grade 4 in the left wrist extensor, grade 3 in the left fingers flexor and grade 4 in the left fingers extensor. Adduction and abduction of the left fingers were also severely impaired (grade 3). Deep tendon reflexes were mildly brisker ipsilateral to the affected hand. No Babinski sign was observed.
Cervical computed tomography (CT) was unremarkable. Peripheral motor nerve conduction velocities were normal. Small, discrete ischemic lesions appeared hyperintense on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence (upper arrows on Fig. ). The infarct was located in the right posterior part of the precentral hand knob area (upper arrow on 1d), near the central sulcus (lower arrow on Fig. ). CT angiography showed significant stenosis in the right proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) trunk.
Transesophageal echocardiogram and carotid ultrasound did not suggest an embolic source. Hypercoagulable screening and levels of markers specific to systemic vasculitis were all normal. An embolism arising from the ipsilateral MCA stenosis was subsequently considered as the etiology of the patient’s symptoms, and she received acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel for secondary stroke prevention.
At the 2-month follow-up, the patient complained of fatigue and progressive headaches. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. Follow-up 3-Tesla MRI with gadolinium contrast revealed focal wall enhancement in the right proximal MCA (Fig. ), indicating cerebral angiitis. Multiple stenoses at the same location were seen on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) (Fig. ). Brain biopsy was not performed.
Cyclophosphamide infusions were administered with glucocorticoids over the subsequent 15 weeks. Left-hand motor function improved, aside from her left fifth finger.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 77-year-old man was admitted to our department after developing a fever and backache. Based on CT findings (Figure ) and laboratory test results, pyelonephritis was initially suspected. Antibiotic therapy improved his symptoms and laboratory indicators of inflammation. One year later, he complained of backache. CT revealed a progressively enlarging renal lesion, multiple liver masses, enlargement of the para-aortic lymph nodes, and multiple osteoblastic and osteoclastic lesions (Figure ). A renal tumor with multiple metastases was suspected considering the clinical course and imaging findings retrospectively. At the time, TCC was suspected, which later proved to be a misdiagnosis. MVAC therapy was given without effect, and 1 year later the patient died of cardiac failure that was unrelated to the treatment. On autopsy, the primary tumor was found to be a collecting duct carcinoma, and liver, right adrenal gland, right upper ureter, bone marrow, para-aortic and mediastinal lymph node, and bone metastases were found.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 66-year-old woman with no prior cardiac history was admitted for primary percutaneous intervention with intermittent atypical chest pain radiating to the jaw for 1 day, and ST elevation on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Her past medical history included surgical removal of superficial melanoma of the thorax and left shoulder in 2008 and 2016, without evidence of metastasis. She suffered from impaired memory since 5 years, and probable CAA was diagnosed 2 months prior to the myocardial infarction. There were no other cardiac risk factors present at admission. Physical examination was without abnormalities.
Sinus rhythm was observed on the admission ECG, with normal heart axis, narrow QRS (120 ms) with ST elevation in leads V2 through V6. No conduction disturbances were present ().
A significant rise-and-fall of serum troponin was measured with a peak of 131 ng/L (cTnl (Cardiac-specific Troponin I) n < 14 ng/L). Other laboratory results were unremarkable with normal liver and renal function.
Radial approach coronary angiography was performed and the culprit vessel was shown to be the left anterior descending artery of the left coronary artery with a 100% obstruction in the distal segment. Two 2.5–16 mm drug eluting stents were placed with restoration of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction 2 flow (). Other coronary vessels were non-obstructed. Echocardiography with microbubbles (Optison™) injection revealed an LV function of 35% with hypokinesia of the anterior wall with akinesia of apical segments and aneurysm formation, without LV thrombi present (, Video Appendix).
Patient received medical treatment with aspirin, clopidogrel, a statin, a betablocker, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor initially. During outpatient follow-up, LV function remained stable at 35%. An LV mass was detected after 6 months ().
The neurologist was consulted regarding this complication and its therapeutic consequences. A conjoined decision was made by the cardiologist and neurologist to discontinue aspirin and clopidogrel and start apixaban twice daily 5 mg, based on its efficacy- and safety profile in CAA patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) as well as multidisciplinary consensus. Despite stable cardiac function, she suffered from an ischaemic stroke 1 year later, the LV thrombus considered being the cause.
With no new ICH or hemosiderosis present on repeat brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), apixaban was discontinued and phenprocoumon [vitamin K antagonist (VKA)] was started. During follow-up, no complications or adverse events were reported.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"In 2008, a 69-year-old man was diagnosed with a nonmetastatic Fuhrman grade 3 left RCC. A radical left nephrectomy was performed, and the patient was monitored for 2 years without any other medical complications. No renal failure or electrolyte disorders were reported. In 2010, a metastatic progression was suspected on a systematic computed tomography scan, with lateral aortic nodes involvement and a left renal fossa tumor extended to the left colon and diaphragm. Sunitinib was initiated at 37.5 mg/day after biopsies confirmed a histology-proven metastatic RCC recurrence. The patient was treated with a 28-day on and 14-day off schedule. Plasma uric acid was normal at baseline. During the first cycle of this treatment, the patient presented his very first episode of gout attack located on a big toe. As it was reported to be normal in 30% of acute gout attacks if assessed immediately, the plasma uric acid concentration was assessed 15 days later, which was 81 mg/L (normal plasma uric acid concentration <70 mg/L). No concomitant renal failure, hemoglobin and/or hematocrit disorder, or concurrent medication intake other than sunitinib (acetylsalicylic acid, diuretics, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, etc.) were reported. Purine-rich food and alcohol were cutoff, but the patient did not consume much of them. Allopurinol (100 mg/day) was initiated before the second cycle of sunitinib without colchicine because interactions with sunitinib were feared. Two months later, during the fourth sunitinib cycle, the patient developed a similar acute gout attack without any identified triggering factor. Allopurinol dose was increased to maximum (300 mg/day), while sunitinib was maintained at 37.5 mg/day until progression. The patient kept sticking to his purine-depleted diet. Iterative gout attacks of lower intensity were still periodically reported during the following months under sunitinib therapy. After progression, a new line of treatment was initiated. Sunitinib discontinuation was followed by a total regression of gout attacks.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 20-year old male presented with complaint of pain for 8 months in left hip with limited range of motion. Pain usually becomes worse at night and was only relieved on medication. He had no previous history of any trauma. His X-ray hip joint was normal []. The patient then underwent both magneto resonance imaging (MRI) and a 99mTechnetium methylene diphosphonate (99mTc-MDP) bone scan. A 99mTc-MDP bone scan showed increased tracer uptake in left hip joint with a tiny faint focus of increased activity on neck of femur []. MRI showed significant joint effusion with abnormal focal signal intensity involving neck of left femur []. At this point, no specific diagnosis could be established. Patient underwent exploratory surgery but it was of no help. Post-operation his symptoms worsened further. Six months post-operatively, he underwent F-18 Fluoride positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) bone scan that showed focal increased tracer uptake corresponding to a tiny calcified nidus along the anterior cortex of neck of femur with mild uptake in left hip joint and joint effusion. A diagnosis of osteoid osteoma with reactive synovitis was made [].

"A 38-year-old female presented with acute onset of spontaneous CSF rhinorrhoea, which started a month ago. The patient disregarded the symptom and related it to rhinosinusitis. However, she again had episodes of intermittent nasal discharge on left side. She denied history of headache, vomiting, blurring, visual disturbance, or head injury. The ophthalmoscopic examination revealed papilledema [] with normal visual acuity and field charting. The laboratory analysis of nasal discharge tested positive for beta-2 transferrin. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cisternography was requested to demonstrate site of leakage. The patient was advised to get MRI on the day of active nasal discharge. The MRI was acquired in prone position with a dry cotton pledget placed in the left nasal opening. A tiny focus of CSF leakage was identified in the left cribriform plate [; zoomed up ], which was seen continuing posteroinferiorly into the nasal cavity []. The dry cotton pledget got soaked with CSF and appeared hyperintense on T2 weighted images []. In addition, MRI demonstrated perioptic CSF distension [], vertical tortuosity of the optic nerves [Figure and ], empty sella [], and very prominent CSF distended bilateral Meckel's cave []. No intracranial mass was noted. Moreover, MR venography showed bilateral distal transverse sinus stenosis []. Imaging diagnosis of IIH was suggested.
Lumbar puncture was performed 2 weeks later at the time of absence of CSF rhinorrhoea, which demonstrated increased opening pressure of 30 cm of H2O (normal 10–18 cm of H2O) with normal CSF composition on laboratory analysis. This confirmed imaging diagnosis of IIH. The patient was offered computerized tomography (CT) scan, which she denied. The patient was treated medically and was offered endoscopic surgical repair. Eventually, patient was lost to follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"An 83-year-old male patient came to the Department of Hand and Reconstructive Surgery of the People's Hospital (Zhejiang Province, China) complaining of mild pain and swelling, and upon inspection a mass was found in his left upper abdomen. This mass had been slowly increasing in size for 2 years. Two years ago, the patient had undergone an operation to remove an abdominal soft tissue fibrosarcoma. The local general surgeon had used a mesh to repair the peritoneal defect and to close the abdominal wall directly. Unfortunately, the incision did not heal due to infection, and the mesh was soon taken out by operation. The incision resulted in a draining wound, and bacterial cultures eventually showed that the wound had a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection. The patient repeatedly came to the clinic to have his bandage replaced, but the masses in his abdomen gradually increased in size. The patient was referred to the Hand Department, and while laboratory tests were normal, further examination by computed tomography imaging revealed that the tumor had recurred, and that the patient also had a hernia in the upper abdomen along with the infected wound. Considering the patient's condition, the main purpose of the operation was to resect the tumor and treat the hernia. The surgical procedure was designed to resect the recurrent tumor using a left upper abdomen approach under general anesthesia, but a very large (15 × 8 cm) abdominal wall defect was found on peritoneum, which could not be directly sutured (Fig. ). In this case there was no obvious skin defect. Because of this defect, a right upper abdominal lateral approach for the operation was planned. The operation was planned to include a vascularized partial 9 to 10 ribs-pleural transfer (without a thoracic umbilical flap) by the vessel pedicle of the deep inferior epigastric artery (DIEA). The vascularized partial 9 to 10 ribs-pleural transfer material was first harvested so that it was connected only by the artery pedicle (Fig. ).
The vascularized partial 9 to 10 ribs-pleural transfer was translocated to the left abdominal wall defect site via subcutaneous tunnel. The composite tissue was used to fill in the abdominal wall defect (Fig. ). First, we sutured the broken peritoneum to the pleura, and then sutured the intercostal muscles to the abdominal muscles. Next, we closed the skin and the abdominal wall defect. Examinations after the surgery revealed that the right lung was not harmed. The right rib donor was wired closed using 1 mm steel wire, and the muscles, subcutaneous tissue, and skin were all sutured directly.
Three days after the surgery, the patient's basal temperature returned to normal and he began to eat a full liquid diet. Six days after the surgery, we pulled out a subcutaneous drainage tube and the patient was able to eat half liquid diet. The patient had been given an infusion of Claforan for 1 week (4 g every 12 h; North China Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, China). Ten days after the surgery, we removed the abdominal cavity drainage tube and the patient had recovered to the point where he could eat a normal diet. Two weeks after the surgery the incision healed, sutures were removed, and the patient was discharged. One year after the surgery, no masses in his abdomen were evident, and magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed no evidence of tumor recurrence. The patient also reported no abdominal pain or swelling symptoms. The patients’ diet and breathing were normal and the patient was then able to be able to resume his daily activities. Nevertheless, we continued to observe and follow up with the patient (Fig. ).
These study protocols were approved by the medical ethics committee of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital. Written informed consent for publication of clinical details and images was obtained from the patient. A copy of the consent form is available for review upon request.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"On 21 May 2009, a 42-yr-old male patient visited our hospital because of malaise and jaundice. He had been working as an office manager of a trading company in China for two years. Two mild fever, and one month before examination, he felt unusual fatigue and jaundice. Twenty days before examination, he had been informed that his acute hepatitis was unusual because he had no hepatitis A, B, or C viral markers. He took herbal medication and received acupuncture in China under the diagnosis of acute hepatitis of unknown origin. His symptoms improved under herbal medication, but remained. He returned to Korea for treatment of the acute hepatitis. He had no other symptoms except for scanty whitish phlegm. He had been healthy until the recent illness. He was not currently on medication, was not an injecting drug abuser. He did not smoke nor drink alcohol. He had received no blood transfusion. He had been married for seven years, but had lived alone in China for two years. He was well oriented and his vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed icteric sclera and tender hepatomegaly. No mucous membrane lesions nor lymphadenopathy were present and he was afebrile. Cutaneous manifestations consisted of macular and papular lesions, about 0.5 cm in diameter, localized on the trunk, palms, and soles (). Genital examination revealed no lesions nor ulcers. Lymph nodes were not palpable in the neck, axillary, or inguinal areas. Laboratory tests showed the following: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 2,974 IU/L, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) 1,755 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 89 IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 119 IU/L, total bilirubin 8.3 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 6.9 mg/dL, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, albumin 2.4 g/dL, total protein 9.2 g/dL, white blood cell (WBC) 13,600/µL, hemoglobin 9.7 g/dL, platelets 752,000/µL, international normalized ratio (INR) 1.06, venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) was positive with a titer >1:1,024, and his fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) was reactive. A hepatitis panel including IgM anti-HAV, HBsAg, and anti-HCV, antinuclear antibody, ceruloplasmin, copper, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were all nonreactive. Computerized tomography didn't show any evidence of bile duct obstruction. It showed also mildly enlarged liver, nonspecifically enlarged lymph nodes at the porta hepatis area, and thickened gall bladder wall (). Chest radiography was normal.
Liver biopsy revealed portal-to-portal or portal to central zone bridge necrosis, and widening by lymphocyte infiltration, accompanied by intracanalicular and intracellular cholestasis. These findings were compatible with acute hepatitis (). A modified Warthin-Starry stain was negative for spirochetes. Skin biopsy revealed a perivascular mixed-cell infiltrate of prominent plasma cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes around a blood vessel that contained swollen endothelial cells ().
The patient was treated with weekly intramuscular benzathine penicillin, 2,400,000 U, for a total of three doses. One week after treatment, his fatigue and rash were markedly improved. Three weeks after treatment, ALP was 288 IU/L, total bilirubin was 0.3 mg/dL () and four weeks after treatment, the VDRL titer was down to 1:64. He did not develop a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. Positive serologic tests and a prompt response to penicillin treatment confirmed the diagnosis of syphilitic cholestatic hepatitis.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 61-year-old man with diabetes mellitus underwent uneventful phacoemulsification and implantation of IOL (AcrySof SA60AT; Alcon Surgery) in the right eye in December 2013. Later, he presented with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, retinal detachment, and vitreous hemorrhage with a vision of hand motion in the right eye. PPV and silicone oil tamponade were performed in November 2014. Postoperative course was smooth and vision was 20/120. Removal of silicone oil and intravitreal air injection was performed in March 2016, and postoperative vision was 20/100. However, whitish granular deposits were observed in the anterior surface of the IOL confined to the pupillary zone 1 month after surgery and vision decreased to 20/120 []. The opacification and his vision were stationary in the 9-month follow-up.
Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT; Cirrus HD-OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec Co.

"The patient was a 12-year old female suffering since early infancy from atopic dermatitis and asthma. Both skin and respiratory symptoms were perennial, with worsening in spring and autumn. Allergy testing, performed at the age of 18 months, resulted positive to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and farinae. In addition, tomato, hen’s egg and cow milk were positive to skin prick tests. Following environmental measures to reduce house dust mite exposure and the elimination of tomato, egg and milk from the diet, there was an improvement of the patient’s asthma condition but not in atopic dermatitis. At 3 and 6 years of age, there was a worsening of dermatitis with modest response to topical corticosteroids, while asthma was no longer present. A further worsening of atopic dermatitis occurred at 9 years of age, which was treated with oral bethametasone and topical pimecrolimus. In September 2014, the patient was referred to our Unit; we found peripheral eosinophilia of 14.4% and, suspecting parasitic infections, we evaluated specific IgE for A. lumbricoides, which had a value of 32.50 kU/L. Anthelmintic therapy was prescribed using mebendazole (one 100 mg 1 tablet b.i.d. for 3 days), repeated after 20 and 50 days. Table shows patient data. One month after the first two cycles of therapy, the patient showed progressive improvement of symptoms (Fig. ), and eosinophilia was 12%.

"A 43-year-old Caucasian female presented with multiple episodes of loose, watery, dark stools. Her presentation was associated with gradual onset, colicky, lower abdominal pain since the previous day. She otherwise denied any fever, nausea, or vomiting, history of ill contact, or any history of travelling or taking outside food. No one within her household had similar symptoms.
The patient had been diagnosed several years earlier with multiple sclerosis (MS) and is wheel-chair-bound due to that disease. She had been prescribed alemtuzumab in a clinical trial 10 years preceding this presentation and had used teriflunomide for one year prior to being prescribed ocrelizumab by her neurologist—she had received two doses six months apart. She denied any prior history of inflammatory bowel disease or bowel cancer.
Upon examination, it was noted that she was afebrile and was haemodynamically stable. Examination of the abdomen revealed a soft abdomen with tenderness at the suprapubic and iliac regions with increased bowel sounds but no evidence of peritonism or organomegaly. Digital per rectal examination established an empty rectum.
The patient was ordered a range of initial laboratory and imaging investigations and follow-up diagnostics based on those findings (Tables and ). The abdominal X-ray () demonstrated a classical thumbprinting sign that was nonspecific but suspicious for clostridium difficile infection. Empirical antibiotics IV metronidazole and oral vancomycin were commenced for presumed clostridium difficile infection while awaiting for laboratory tests and histology results.
The patient's venous blood gas showed lactate of 4 mmol/L (normal range, 0.6–1.8 mmol/L) which prompted a CT abdomen. The CT demonstrated a pronounced colitis extending from the transverse colon to the sigmoid colon. When the patient did not respond to IV metronidazole and oral vancomycin, a flexible sigmoidoscopy was undertaken and showed nodular mucosa with white-yellowish adherent plaques with increasing severity from the rectosigmoid to the sigmoid (Figures and ). The histology from biopsies taken from various parts of the left colon was negative for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and clostridium difficile infection, but suggestive of biological medication effect.
Accordingly, the patient was treated as ocrelizumab-induced colitis and commenced on intravenous hydrocortisone. Her CRP was downtrending on hydrocortisone. However, serial abdominal X-rays demonstrated ongoing gaseous distension, and she continued having watery bowel motions. The patient was referred to a tertiary hospital and colorectal surgeons for medication-resistant biological medication-induced colitis. She subsequently underwent a total colectomy and ileostomy formation.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 42-year-old previously healthy male was referred to our tertiary center complaining of high-grade fever accompanied by chills over the last 20 days. He also complained of progressively increasing breathlessness, nonproductive cough, and right-sided chest pain. There was no history of weight loss or abdominal pain. He denied smoking tobacco. On arrival at our center, he was found to be febrile and dyspneic. His pulse was 120/min, respiratory rate 28/min, and SP02 was 95% at room air. The systemic examination of the chest revealed decreased breath sounds in the right lower zone and coarse crackles in the right infrascapular region. No peripheral or deep chain lymphadenopathy was detected on physical or imaging examinations. The hematological workup showed a leukocyte count of 18,000/µl (reference range [RR]; 4000-12000/μL) with 80% polymorphs. Liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. The serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 1650 U/L (RR; 150-250U/L). The chest X-ray revealed a heterogeneous opacity in the right pulmonary lower lobe and pleural effusion, which showed to be hemorrhagic after diagnostic thoracocentesis (A). The computed tomographic (CT)-guided Tru-cut biopsy attempted in the original-attending hospital showed necrotic tissue. The thoracic CT scan after the second hospitalization revealed a well-defined irregularly, marginated, complex, non-enhancing mass in the right lung, likely pleural based with thickened visceral pleura causing collapse and consolidation of the right lung (B). The radiological differentials comprised malignant mesothelioma versus a synovial sarcoma.
A new CT-guided biopsy was attempted and showed atypical cells consistent with an underlying malignant lesion (A). The thoracocentesis revealed an exudative and hemorrhagic pleural effusion without malignant cells.
Meanwhile, the patient’s clinical condition deteriorated, he became tachypneic and developed puffiness of the face and altered sensorium and a clinical diagnosis of superior vena cava obstruction was made. He was kept on an antibiotic regimen with Piperacillin-Tazobactam, corticosteroids and controlled ventilation. Bedside 2D echocardiogram failed to evidence a pericardial tamponade, but the mass was seen compressing the right atrium and superior vena cava. On the eighth day of hospitalization, his general condition suddenly worsened, and he expired. Immediately. the autopsy was performed with the working diagnosis of a right lung mass with SVC syndrome, probably due to malignant mesothelioma or a high-grade sarcoma.
External examination revealed proptosis of eyes and midline shift of trachea to the left. On the opening of the chest cavity, the right hemithorax was replaced by a massive hemorrhagic and necrotic tumor mass, which was adherent to the chest wall. In comparison, on the left side, there were 25 ml of straw-colored pleural fluid noted with pleural sheen (A). The right lung weighed 1200 g (RR; 360-570 g), and Left lung weighed 550 g (RR; 325-480 g). The right lung was replaced by a large tumor, which was chiefly necrotic, hemorrhagic, and pulpy. Only a portion of the posterior segment of the middle lobe was noted to be intact. The tumor mass pushed the trachea to the left. The left lung was boggy and was oozing frothy blood-stained fluid. The cut section did not show any cavities, abscesses, or tumor deposits (B).
The liver was enlarged and weighed 1800 g (RR:1500-1800 g). The external surface was smooth and glistening. No nodularity was noted. The cut surface showed a nutmeg appearance suggestive of passive venous congestion. No mass lesion was identified.
The spleen was enlarged, and weighed 230 g (RR:150-200 g). External and cut surface showed congestion. Both kidneys, pancreas, stomach, intestines, heart and brain were externally and on cut sections unremarkable.
Histological examination of the lung depicted tumor cells in cohesive sheets, having a peritheliomatous arrangement amidst predominantly necrotic areas. The tumor cells were round to oval, had coarsely stippled chromatin with scant to mildly eosinophilic cytoplasm. Nucleoli were inconspicuous, and mitosis was brisk. Numerous apoptotic bodies were also noted (2C).
IHC reactions showed the tumor cells to be diffusely positive for Vimentin (strong cytoplasmic positivity), CD99 (strong membranous positivity), and FLI 1(strong nuclear positivity). The tumor cells were diffusely negative for calretinin, WT1, D240, synaptophysin, CD56, TTF1, Tdt, S-100, desmin, myogenin, BCL-2, LCA, and EMA. On Periodic Schiff stain (PAS), the cytoplasm of tumor cells showed strong magenta cytoplasmic positivity (AD). Sections from the left upper and lower lobe showed normal air-filled alveoli lined by type II pneumocytes.
No tumor deposits were seen. Sections from the right and left lobe of the liver showed features of passive venous congestion. No tumor deposits were noted. Sections from the spleen showed expansion of red pulp with attenuation of the white pulp.

"Case 2: A 52-year-old woman known for intracranial hypertension for 7 years, who was hospitalized for the investigation of headaches with tonic epileptic seizures. A brain MRI showed diffuse pachymeningitis. Due to unusual headaches located in the temporal area associated with hyperesthesia of the scalp and inflammatory syndrome, a temporal artery biopsy was performed and showed inflammatory lymphocytic infiltrate with intimal fibrosis, disappearance of the elastic lamina, and vasa vasorum granulomas. Nasal biopsy revealed mixed inflammation with rough granuloma. With MRI pansinusitis and positive cANCA-PR3, the diagnosis of GPA was made, and the patient was treated with corticosteroids and rituximab with an improvement in inflammatory syndrome and symptoms.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 65-year-old woman had been diagnosed with overlap syndrome (autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis) for 14 years. Initially, she was prescribed ursodeoxycholic acid and prednisone, and refused immunosuppressive drugs. However, due to the presence of gastric ulcer and economic reasons, she stopped taking these medications. When liver test results were abnormal, she would take compound glycyrrhizin tablets to treat the disease. In September 2013, due to hematemesis and melena, rupture and hemorrhage of the esophagofundal varices was found. Computed tomography revealed cirrhosis of the liver, splenomegaly, and ascites. The disease progressed to Child–Pugh C decompensated cirrhosis. The patient received endoscopic therapy, and began taking prescribed ursodeoxycholic acid 750 mg daily. From September 2013 to August 2015, her alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level fluctuated between 27 and 91 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase between 33 and 94 U/L, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase between 73 and 240 U/L, alkaline phosphatase between 130 and 260 U/L, total bilirubin (TBIL) between 39.3 and 74.05 mol/L, direct bilirubin between 17.6 and 34.24 mol/L, albumin between 30 and 35 g/L, antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer between 1:1000 and 1:3200, and antimitochondrial II antibody (AMA-M2) between (+) and (++). In September 2015, the patient consulted her physician in our department for significant jaundice and weakness. Physical examination revealed yellow pigmentation of the skin and sclerae, positive liver palms, spider angioma on the chest, and positive shifting dullness. Results of liver function tests showed the following: ALT, 499.9 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 686.8 U/L; albumin, 27.02 g/L; γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, 87.2 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 225.6 U/L; TBIL, 329.6 mol/L; direct bilirubin, 272.91 mol/L; cholinesterase, 2156.4 U/L; prothrombin time, 17.7 seconds; percentage prothrombin time activity, 60; and platelet count, 45 × 109/L. The anti-HCV antibody test result was positive and the quantitative HCV RNA test result was 6.1 × 105 IU/mL (genotype 1). The ANA titer was 1:3200, and the AMA-M2 was (+). Epigastric enhanced magnetic resonance imaging identified cirrhosis, splenomegaly, ascites, and collateral circulation in the esophagus, fundus of the stomach, and splenic hilum. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography did not detect any abnormality in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. Initially, the treatment included ursodeoxycholic acid at the previous dosage, glycyrrhizinate, human serum albumin, furosemide, spironolactone, lactulose oral solution, and platelet and clotting factor transfusion. However, after 1 week, weakness and jaundice were exacerbated. Liver function test results were significantly abnormal with a TBIL of 417.6 mol/L, prothrombin time of 23.5 seconds, percentage prothrombin time activity of 46, albumin of 23.1 g/L, cholinesterase of 1789.7 U/L, and platelet count of 14 × 109/L. After ruling out other possible causes of acute hepatitis, we thought that the cause of the acute exacerbation of hepatic damage was AHC infection, as liver function was decreased by HCV activity. After discussing the risks and benefits with the patient, we started her on an IFN-free combination therapy of SOF and weight-based RBV for 12 weeks. Gilead-brand SOF (400 mg/d) was used. SOF cannot be bought in China; the patient acquired the medication through her relative who works abroad. The patient was reviewed at treatment weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12 and at posttreatment weeks 4, 12, 24, and 36. At the beginning of SOF and RBV treatment, the HCV RNA viral load was 4.8 × 106 IU/mL. At week 1, the HCV RNA viral load was reduced to 4330 IU/mL; at week 2, 1790 IU/mL; and at week 3, 750 IU/mL. At weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 48 (posttreatment week 36), the HCV viral load was undetectable (Fig. ). By week 4, the patient's symptoms alleviated. By week 8, liver function returned to baseline levels with TBIL of 85.35 mol/L, prothrombin time of 17.0 seconds, albumin of 29.5 g/L, and platelet count of 53.2 × 109/L (Fig. ).","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 22-year-old male presented to our clinic with recurrent episodes of hemoptysis over a 4-week period with 3 distinct events. He stated that this started with an incidence of heavy coughing. He then would cough up to 2–4 tablespoons of blood. After presentation to the emergency room, it was initially thought this was related to epistaxis, and he was sent home with treatment for allergic rhinitis. He had no other symptoms, denying fever, weight loss or gain, chest pain, easy bruising, dyspnea, or rash. He did complain of chronic postnasal drip, nasal congestion, and occasional pruritis, which he attributed to allergies. He had a past medical history of eosinophilic colitis, obsessive-compulsive disorder, history of an aneurismal bone cyst status post-removal, and allergic rhinitis. He had also been recently diagnosed with hypogonadism over the last 5 months, and was on injectable testosterone supplementation. He denied smoking, alcohol, and illicit drug use and had no known inhalant exposures and trauma to the airway that he could recall. His family history included a brother with eosinophilic colitis and his mother had vascular ectasias of her spinal cord. He did note that these episodes seemed to occur 5 days after his dose of intramuscular testosterone. Physical exam was otherwise unremarkable and laboratory values were unrevealing. Computed tomography did not reveal any notable lesion of the upper airway or lung parenchyma.
Upon flexible bronchoscopic evaluation, the following lesion was seen in the distal trachea (). The purple, vascular lesion was approximately 1–1.5 cm in size located 3 cm from the carina at the 5 o'clock position along the posterior wall attached by a short pedicle. A biopsy was taken at that time which only showed fibrin products and inflammatory cells. Hemostasis was difficult to obtain without use of cold saline, several injections of topical epinephrine and Argon Plasma Coagulation. Due to unavailability of pathology and the location of the lesion, the patient was taken to the operating suite where a therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was used with utilized. The lesion was obtained by electrocautery loop snare and endoscopic basket. The pathology revealed the diagnosis of lobular capillary hemangioma (Figures and ). The superficial portions of the lesion had undergone secondary, nonspecific changes including stromal edema, capillary dilation, inflammation, and a granulation tissue reaction. It demonstrated diagnostic, lobular arrangements of capillaries at its base, which consisted of discrete clusters of endothelial cells. The cellular architecture was made up of an inflammatory infiltrate of neutrophils and monocytes.
Upon followup, the patient had no hemoptysis episodes and has subsequently stopped his testosterone therapy.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 21-year-old male with a history of one episode of right orchitis well treated with antibiotics two years ago presented to the urology outpatient department with a painless swelling of the right hemiscrotum without any associated other symptoms. Local examination revealed a palpable firm right testicular mass with atrophy of the whole testis. The left testis was palpated in the scrotum and is of normal size with no suspicious mass. His laboratory findings including Germ Cell Tumour serum markers were within the normal range (Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP): 0,86 μg/L, Beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-HCG) < 0,5 mIU/mL, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 241 UI/ml).
Scrotal ultrasound () demonstrated a suspicious solid well-defined mass within the right epididymis, measuring 21 x 14 mm. The mass was slightly heterogeneous with hyperechoic appearance and regular smooth contour. Distinct from the lesion, the right testis appeared smaller in size measuring 23 x 12 x 15 mm. Imaging of the contralateral scrotum revealed no anomaly. A radical right orchiectomy was performed via an inguinal incision. Recovery was uneventful. The surgical specimen consisted of the right testis measuring 3.5x2.5x1 cm in size and of the spermatic cord measuring 5 cm in length. Sectioning of the specimen () revealed a single well circumscribed nodular tissue with multiple foci of hemorrhage. Microscopic examination of the nodular tissue () showed an admixture of mature lobulated adipose tissue and numerous dilated and thicken walled blood vessels with no signs of malignancies such as germ cell atypia or intraepithelial germ cell neoplasm. Thus a diagnosis of paratesticular angiolipoma was made.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 6-year-old, Norwegian born, intact male Russian Tsvetnaya Bolonka, 6 kg, was referred to the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU) at the Small Animal Teaching Hospital with a 4.5-months history of progressive weakness. Starting with weakness of the tail and reduced general condition, the clinical signs progressed to include dysphonia, muscle pain, and lameness of the pelvic limbs, more prominent on the right. Two months prior to referral, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) of the lumbar region had been performed, demonstrating asymmetrical pelvic limb muscle atrophy involving particularly the right iliopsoas and quadriceps musculature. Several years before the first clinical signs of the progressive weakness appeared the dog was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and had been treated with substitution therapy since then. He had never left Norway.
General physical examination revealed reduced muscle mass of the proximal muscles of the right pelvic limb and the dog was afebrile (38.8 °C). On neurologic examination, the dog was ambulatory but paraparetic, more pronounced on the right, with an obvious hypoflexion of the hip joint, bunny-hopping gait, and a paretic tail. Cranial nerves were normal except for the observed dysphonia, whereas postural reactions were decreased in both pelvic limbs with reduced spinal reflexes in the right pelvic limb. The neuroanatomic localisation was considered to be the neuromuscular system. Differential diagnoses included inflammatory, as well as non-inflammatory, myopathies/neuropathies.
A complete blood count (CBC) and serum biochemistry profile revealed mildly increased creatinine phosphokinase, but was otherwise unremarkable. Toxoplasma gondii-specific IgM titre was border line (1:32) while IgG was negative, as was a follow-up IgM titre. Neospora caninum antibody titres were negative, and serum total thyroxine concentration was within the reference range.
By the time of a planned revisit to NMBU for laryngeal inspection, diagnostic imaging, electrodiagnostics, and biopsies 2 weeks after referral, the clinical signs had progressed further and the dog was now showing general paresis in all four limbs. During a light plane of anaesthesia, laryngeal inspection was performed showing immobile arytenoids and vocal cords bilaterally, indicative of a laryngeal paresis causing the dysphonia. Pre- and post-contrast CT examinations of the whole body were performed under general anaesthesia in dorsal recumbency. Iohexol (Omnipaque 300 mgI/mL, GE Healthcare AS, Oslo, Norway) dosed at 600 mg iodine/kg was administrated intravenously and CT images were acquired using a 4-detector row CT scanner (BrightSpeed, GE Healthcare), 1.25 mm slice thickness, 0.625 mm overlap, using helical acquisition in bone and soft tissue algorithms. The CT-examination revealed bilateral muscle atrophy with various degrees of fat infiltration evident in the muscles of the thigh, thoracic limbs, and head. The muscle atrophy was most prominent on the right side of the back (Fig. ), right pelvic limb, and right aspect of the head (temporal and masseter muscles). Changes in the triceps musculature were most prominent on the left side. Electromyography performed under general anaesthesia showed spontaneous activity in multiple muscle groups. Motor nerve conduction velocity was measured to be 40.5 m per second (m/s) (mean ± SEM in healthy dogs: 60 ± 1.1 m/s []) in the ulnar nerve, and no other nerves were tested. Muscle biopsies were taken from the right biceps femoris muscle, the left triceps muscle, and the longissimus dorsi muscles bilaterally, and submitted for a routine muscle biopsy panel established at the Neuropathology Laboratory, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, München, Germany. On histological examination, all muscle samples revealed multifocal interstitial and occasionally fibre-directed lymphohistiocytic infiltrates which, in some fields, were accompanied by granulomatous changes with giant cells and/or epithelioid macrophages (Fig. ). Intramuscular nerve branches were diffusely affected by endoneurial granulomatous changes. Perimysium and endomysium showed moderately increased amounts of fibrocollagenous tissue accompanied by patchy areas of mild perimysial lipomatosis. Grocott’s methenamine silver stain for fungi, Fite Faraco stain for acid-fast bacteria and Gram stain were all negative. Likewise, 16s rRNA polymerase chain reaction was negative for bacterial sequences. Based on these findings, aseptic granulomatous polymyositis and neuritis were diagnosed.
Following the negative microbial investigations, treatment was initiated with glucocorticoids (prednisolone) 1.7 mg/kg per os (p.o) twice daily for 2 weeks, followed by gradual tapering to a lower maintenance dose. At a revisit 1 month later, clinical signs had improved but were still present. Gradual improvement of the clinical signs continued over the next few months and then stabilised. At this point, neurologic examination revealed mild reductions of the right pelvic limb flexor reflex and the patellar reflex. Gait evaluation showed circumduction of the right pelvic limb but was otherwise normal. There were no signs of dysphonia or laryngeal paralysis and the tail had regained its normal position. Approximately 1 year after initiating treatment the dog had a mild relapse of clinical signs while receiving prednisolone at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg every third day. Following a dose increase, the owner reported an immediate positive response. The dog was re-examined again 16 months after initiating treatment. Gait evaluation was normal except for a mild gait disturbance of the right pelvic limb. Electromyography was repeated and spontaneous activity was still observed in several muscle groups, but to a lesser extent than before. Motor nerve conduction velocity of the right ulnar nerve was measured to be 48.0 m/s. A CT was performed and revealed similar findings as previously, except for an increased amount of subcutaneous fat, predominantly of the dorsum, considered most likely to represent an adverse effect of prednisolone treatment.
Two years after the first visit, the dog presented to the Emergency Service at NMBU with clinical signs of lethargy, pyrexia (40.2 °C), weakness, and coughing. Blood analysis, ultrasound, and CT were in agreement with a septic condition and the dog was treated accordingly. However, three days later the dog went into cardiac arrest and died. Autopsy was performed at the pathology department of NMBU and further muscle/nerve samples were sent to the Neuropathology Laboratory, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, München, for follow-up. The autopsy revealed purulent myocarditis, fibrinous pericarditis, interstitial nephritis, and centrilobular necrosis and thrombosis of the liver. Several muscle samples showed changes corresponding to a multifocal, subacute suppurative myositis with fibre necrosis. Muscle atrophy and intermediate neuropathy featuring axonal atrophy and partial demyelination were also present. No granulomatous changes were seen at that stage. Adipose tissue in between the muscle fibres had increased, which is expected when inflammatory changes is restricted to the interstitial compartments (Fig. ). Microbiology samples taken from the liver and spleen showed moderate growth of Escherichia coli, confirming the final septic condition.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"An 18-year-old female patient reported to our department with the complaint of poor esthetic appearance due to missing upper and lower front teeth since 4 years and seeking prosthetic treatment. Patient gave no history of trauma and extractions in relation with the missing teeth. The patient reported that the teeth exfoliated due to loosening. The patient's medical history was not contributory. Family history revealed no such abnormality among other family members.
On intraoral examination [] the morphologic appearance and color of the permanent teeth were normal. In maxillary arch, the missing teeth were from right canine region to left canine region and in mandibular arch, all the incisors were missing. There was generalized grade II and grade III mobility. Oral hygiene was poor and there were plaque and calculus deposits in all the quadrants. Restorations were present in left maxillary first molar and mandibular second molar.
Panoramic radiograph [] revealed adequate enamel thickness on the cuspal tips of all the teeth. There was no root formation in most of the teeth while some of the teeth exhibited short, blunted and malformed roots of only a few millimeters with obliterated pulp chambers. The mandibular first left molar tooth had taurodontism like appearance. Well-defined periapical radiolucencies were present in association with the apex of the mandibular left first molar and right first and second molar.
Although the patient had attained her physical maturity and was ready for definitive dental treatment but her physical, financial and psychological situations were important to be considered in selecting the final treatment plan. The following treatment plan was formulated for the patient. Dietary and oral hygiene instructions were given to the patient and extraction of the teeth that were mobile was advised along with the rehabilitation of the missing teeth with prosthesis.
The right maxillary first molar tooth was extracted and sent to Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology. Clinical examination of the gross specimen [] revealed an intact tooth. The tooth crown was of normal dimensions measuring around 7.5 mm but the roots were short and measured about 6 mm. The specimen was sectioned mesiodistally into halves. The mesiodistally cut tooth surface showed total obliteration of pulp chambers with dentin. One half of the cut tooth specimen was decalcified in 10% nitric acid and processed for hematoxylin-eosin (H and E) staining. Other half of the cut tooth specimen was used for preparing ground section.
The ground section [Figure and ] showed normal crown outline with normal enamel covering. A thin layer of superficial mantle dentin appeared but the pulp chamber was totally obliterated by an unusual calcified material consisting of atypical tubular dentin and osteodentin covered by thin discontinuous layer of cementum. Normal dentinal tubule formation appeared to have been blocked and the new dentin so formed around obstacle, gave rise to the characteristic appearance of “lava flow around the boulder” [].
Histopathologic examination of the decalcified hematoxylin-eosin section [] showed total obliteration of pulp that was filled with tubular dentin, osteodentin and irregular, globular masses of dentin [Figure and ]. A cluster of odontoblasts was seen within the globular masses of dentin.
Based on the clinical, radiographic, gross features and histological examination of the ground section and decalcified section, diagnosis of dentin dysplasia type I was made.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 58-year-old female after allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) presented with cough productive of brown sputum and right shoulder pain. Her symptoms progressed over the course of 2 weeks. She did not have fever, chills, or shortness of breath. She denied chest pain, vomiting, or diarrhea and she did not report headache, loss of consciousness, or seizures.
She was diagnosed with AML 2 years ago for which she underwent allogeneic SCT. Thereafter she developed chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD), which was treated with steroids and mycophenolate mofetil. Her home medications included prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and dapsone.
On examination, she was afebrile with a heart rate of 57, blood pressure of 150/74, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Lung examination revealed reduced air entry and rhonchi over the right upper lung zone. Heart exam revealed regular heart sounds without murmurs and her abdomen was soft without tenderness or organomegaly.
Laboratory tests showed white blood cell count of 7.6 × 109 cells/L (88% neutrophils), hemoglobin of 94 g/L, platelets of 34 × 109 cells/L, and creatinine of 70 μmol/L. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan was done and is shown in . Bronchoalveolar (BAL) stains and cultures were negative for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. Serum as well as BAL galactomannan and serum cryptococcal antigen were negative. Her prednisone dose was reduced and she was discharged home on ertapenem and voriconazole that were given on empirical basis.
The patient's symptoms persisted, so a follow-up chest CT scan was done 2 weeks into treatment (). She was readmitted to the hospital and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics: linezolid, imipenem, amikacin, and liposomal amphotericin B. Her vital signs on admission were stable with an oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Labs were within her baseline. A repeated BAL was performed.
What is your diagnosis?
BAL stains were negative but bacterial cultures grew few branching gram-positive rods that were identified to be N. farcinica. Susceptibility testing was not performed. Liposomal amphotericin B and amikacin were stopped and she continued taking linezolid and imipenem. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) could not be used because she was allergic to sulfa drugs and, unfortunately, sulfa desensitization was not considered. Head CT scan was done and was negative for any brain lesions. Her cough and chest pain worsened and she developed progressive shortness of breath and fevers. Amikacin was added to the regimen without significant improvement in symptoms. She elected to pursue comfort care measures and was discharged to hospice.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"We present a 72-year-old right hand dominant Caucasian female transferred from outside hospital status – post sudden onset severe left neck pain and left arm pain. She stated that her neck pain started the night prior and suddenly started radiating into her left shoulder and arm which was associated with progressive weakness. Her pain was made worse by any movement. She denied any preceding trauma. She denies any medical history other than hypertension. Of note, she stated that she does take 325 mg aspirin daily for joint pain. She denies having any known bleeding disorder but stated that she tends to bruise easily. Her coagulation laboratories indicated aspirin therapeutic response causing platelet dysfunction: platelet EPI >300 (normal 72–184) and platelet function aspirin 560 (normal 570–675). Her platelet count was 400 and other laboratory work noncontributory. Her physical examination was significant for having motor deficits as follows: left upper extremity: 4/5 deltoid, 4/5 bicep, 3/5 triceps, 2/5 wrist extension, 2/5 wrist flexion, 4/5 handgrip, and 2/5 interosseous muscles, left lower extremity: 4+/5 hip flexion, 5/5 knee flexion, 5/5 knee extension, 4+/5 dorsiflexion, 5/5 plantar flexion, and 5/5 extensor hallucis longus. She also had sensory deficits in the left upper extremity which displayed decreased sensation to pinprick in a nondermatomal distribution.
Radiographically, MRI of the cervical spine showed an epidural hematoma dorsal to the cord at the C3-T2 levels measuring up to 6 mm thick []. It lied eccentric toward the left with mild-to-moderate compression on the cord. There was no definite cord edema, abnormal enhancement, or major ligamentous injury. MRA of the neck was negative for any abnormal vascularity.
She was taken to surgery within hours of presentation for emergent posterior C3-C7 decompressive laminectomies and evacuation of intra-SEH. There were findings of dorsal purple clotted epidural hematoma that was eccentric to the left. Operatively, there was complete decompression achieved and hematoma was entirely evacuated. Baseline intraoperative neuromonitoring showed decreased motor signals in bilateral upper extremities, left worse than right. The SSEP sensory signals were normal and stable throughout the surgery. After decompression and evacuation, there was identifiable improvement in bilateral upper extremity motor signals on intraoperative neuromonitoring.
Postoperatively, within the first 24 h period, she had near resolution of her weakness with only residual weakness of 4+/5 wrist extension, 4+/5 wrist flexion, 4/5 handgrip, and 4/5 interosseous muscle. She continued to have left upper extremity decreased sensation to pinprick testing in nondermatomal fashion that was stable. She worked with the physical and occupational therapy teams and was subsequently discharged home with outpatient physical therapy and recommendations to discontinue her daily aspirin use. The above case represents SSEH likely resultant from daily aspirin usage.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 43-year-old male with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis underwent double-lung transplant (LT) at our institution in July 2014. His immunosuppressive regimen included tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. His early post-LT course was complicated by one episode of humoral rejection (at 17 months post-LT) treated with high dose steroid therapy, one episode of acute cellular rejection (at 19 months post-LT) treated with thymoglobulin at the dosage of 125 mg per day for 6 days, and a persistent acute cellular rejection a month later treated with another course of thymoglobulin at the same dosage. During these treatments, he also received pre-emptive valganciclovir in consideration of minimal Cytomegalovirus (CMV) blood replication. Then, 22 months after-LT, he required admission for fever and bilateral pneumonia. A chest computed tomography (CT) showed persistent ground glass opacities, with tree-in-bud appearance, of the right middle and lower lobes (a). Laboratory results showed an elevated C-reactive protein of 78.8 mg/L (normal range 0–5 mg/L) and a normal white blood cells count. Blood cultures turned negative. The forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 1.73 L and the forced vital capacity (FEV1) of 2.16 L. Empirical antibiotic and antifungal therapy with meropenem, linezolid, and liposomal amphotericin B was started with mild clinical improvement. A broncho alveolar lavage (BAL) showed no growth on bacterial and fungal cultures, and galactomannan on BAL was negative. Lung transbronchial biopsy (TBB) showed no signs of acute rejection but was notable for acute bronchitis with aggregates of round and oval elements suggestive for fungi at the PAS staining. PCR 18S-sequencing was performed on the fresh tissue and identified Malassezia restricta. The patient was then started on voriconazole, with a significant progressive improvement in respiratory function, with an increase in both FEV 1 (2 L) and FVC (2.55 L). During the antifungal treatment, the tacrolimus dosage was adjusted according to the serum concentration and aimed at trough levels of 8–10 ng/mL. After 12 months, a new lung-TBB (36 months after-LT) showed the persistence of Malassezia restricta on PCR 18S-RNA molecular identification. At an 18-month follow up (42 months after-LT), both lipid-enriched culture and 18S-RNA on biopsy were negative for fungal pathogens, and the chest-CT-scan showed a notable improvement of radiographic findings (b).

"A 2-year-6-month-old male child, born to non-consanguineous parents, presented with persistent facial swelling, abdominal distention and reduced urine output for 6 weeks. He had recent onset breathing difficulty. He was a known case of NS being treated with prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day. His antenatal and postnatal history were uneventful. His nutrition and immunization status were appropriate for his age. He had nil significant family history.
On examination, the child was active and alert. Anthropometric examination recorded findings appropriate for his age. Examination of vitals revealed tachycardia (heart rate: 108/min), tachypnoea (respiratory rate: 27/min) and oxygen saturation of 93% in room air. He had elevated blood pressure of 130/90 mmHg (>95th percentile for his age and height) and pitting pedal edema.
Routine blood investigations, including renal and liver function tests were within normal limits. His baseline coagulation study and thyroid function test were normal. Urine analysis revealed nephrotic range proteinuria (4+ on dipstick and elevated protein creatinine ratio of 15.78) and microscopic hematuria. He also had hypoalbuminemia (1.4 g/dL) and hypercholesterolemia (1427 mg/dL). Ultrasound showed moderate pleural effusion, ascites and enlarged hyperechogenic kidneys. Suspecting SRNS, renal biopsy was performed, which revealed features of FSGS (). In view of severe anasarca and respiratory distress, he was initiated on albumin infusion with 20% albumin, 1 g/kg followed by diuretics, furosemide 1mg/kg/dose. After 2 sessions of combined albumin and diuretic therapy, edema settled and albumin level increased to 2 g/dL. Genetic study using targeted exome sequencing, revealed heterozygous missense mutation in exon 14 of ANLN gene that results in amino acid substitution of methionine for threonine at codon 821 (p.Thr 821Met;ENST00000265748.7). Currently, he is being treated with tacrolimus 0.1 mg/kg/day and enalapril 0.3 mg/kg/day, along with normal protein and no added salt diet. His parents have been counselled about the disease course, trial of immunosuppressive therapy and the need for renal transplantation in future.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 56-year-old man, case of carcinoma mid-oesophagus underwent TTE with extended two-field lymphadenectomy with gastric pull-up and oesophago-gastric anastomosis in neck. He had received pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy. The procedure was done under epidural and general anaesthesia with conventional monitoring. Right ICD and corrugated neck drain were placed. Intraoperative period was uneventful. Patient was shifted to ICU for post-operative management. The patient developed respiratory distress and air leak through right ICD and saturation decreased to 86% despite oxygen supplementation. Air entry was decreased on the right side. Chest radiograph revealed right pneumothorax despite ICD being in situ. It was decided to conduct bronchoscopy. Before bronchoscopy, we observed bubbles (air leak) from neck drain site. On removal of corrugated neck drain and resuturing the neck wound, air leak stopped and there was no further respiratory distress. Oxygen saturation improved to 96% over next 30 min. Chest X-ray revealed no pneumothorax and patient was shifted to the ward.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"This is a 57-year-old male patient from eastern Morocco, followed up for 10 years for ankylosing spondylitis and admitted to the emergency room for an occlusive syndrome and abdominal pain. The symptomatology goes back two years with the onset of intermittent postprandial abdominal pain in the right iliac fossa which worsened on the day of his admission to the hospital. The clinical examination of our patient revealed tenderness in the right iliac fossa with palpation of a mobile mass measuring about 4 cm and free hernial orifices. The standard biological assessment carried out in the emergency room had objectified an inflammatory syndrome with a CRP increased to 60 mg/L and the CT scan had objectified a cockade image next to the last ileal handle. This image, which is probably related to an ileo-ileal invagination, is also the site of a circumferential thickening, regular symmetrical, measuring 14 mm in maximum thickness with respect for the adjacent fat and without individualization of peri-lesional lymphadenopathy (Figure ).
After multidisciplinary discussion and discussion with the patient, we opted for surgical exploration performed under general anesthesia which had demonstrated an intussusception 50 cm from the last intestinal loop on an intraluminal process with mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Bowel resection with lymphadenectomy involving intussusception with manual anastomosis was performed (Figures , ).
The pathological study noted the presence of an inflammatory pseudo-polyp integrating into chronic inflammatory bowel disease Crohn's type (Figures , ). The patient's postoperative progress course was uneventful, our patient was satisfied with the overall care and the discharge was carried out for five days under specific medical treatment for Crohn's disease. Follow-up after two years was without abnormalities with control of rheumatological and digestive manifestations.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 12-year-old boy with a large retroperitoneal sarcoma with bilateral obstructive uropathy was planned for bilateral ureteric stenting. His preoperative serum creatinine was raised and coagulation parameters were normal. Cystoscopy showed a deformed bladder with severe bullous edema of the trigone. Both the ureteric orifices could not be identified on cystoscopy; hence, a decision of antegrade ureteral stenting was taken. Based on the preoperative plain computed tomography (CT) scan determined landmark of the renal pelvis, a Chiba-needle puncture was made 5 cm lateral to the midline at the level of the third lumbar vertebra. Once the right pelvicalyceal system was opacified, mid calyceal puncture was made using an 18G three-part percutaneous access needle (Surgimedik Healthcare India Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai, India). Guidewire could be negotiated into the bladder, and antegrade double-J stent was placed. A similar procedure was performed on the left side. The procedure was uneventful.
Postprocedure, the patient had a progressively increasing abdominal distension, right flank pain, and hypotension. Bedside ultrasonography indicated a large right perirenal hematoma. Contrast-enhanced CT scan confirmed the hematoma [] and demonstrated active contrast leak from the right lumbar artery during the arteriography phase of the CT scan. Renal vessels appeared normal. In view of the dropping blood pressure and hemoglobin levels, a decision of angioembolization was taken.
Transfemoral aortography and renal angiography were performed. Renal vasculature was normal. Selective catheterization of the second right lumbar artery confirmed the extravasation of contrast solution from the middle part of the anterior branch of lumbar artery. The bleeding vessel was embolized using polyvinyl alcohol particles (Boston Scientific Target Therapeutics, California, USA). Posttranscatheter embolization, the pain reduced and blood pressure stabilized. There was no increase in the size of hematoma over a 1-week hospitalization period.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 71-year-old female presented with abdominal pain, for which esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed. Subsequently, a smooth, protuberant mass of descending duodenum was found (). By endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), performed at Shengjing Hospital, the lesion was homogeneous and hypoechoic, and measured approximately 36 mm × 35 mm (). No internal vessels or blood flow was detectable. Due to its size and indistinct margins, the site of origin was also difficult to ascertain. EUS-FNA was thus elected.
A linear echo endoscope (EG3630, Pentax, Tokyo, Japan) and a 22-gauge needle (Echo Tip Ultra, Cook Endoscopy, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA) were used to access the mass. After lesion the needle was inserted (under EUS guidance) into the targeted tissue (), the stylet was completely withdrawn by carefully retracting the plastic hub housed in the needle handle. A syringe (prepped in advance) was attached by way of Luer lock to the fitting on the needle handle, and its stopcock was turned to the “open” position (aligned with the syringe),10 cc of negative pressure was allowed in the syringe for aspiration of cells. Guided by EUS, the needle handle was moved back and forth gently in small increments. The tissue had been penetrated several times, when a hyperechoic line was noted in the needle track (). Thereafter, a 10 mm × 7 mm cystic area materialized within the mass, and hyperechoic flow was noted (). In a matter of seconds, the cystic zone grew to roughly 25 mm × 20 mm, and the entire mass expanded to 62 mm × 40 mm (). Because hemorrhage within the mass was likely, the procedure was halted, and the patient was hospitalized.
Two hours afterwards the patient complained of severe abdominal pain, later developing diffuse abdominal rigidity and guarding. Non-coagulated blood was withdrawn by abdominocentesis. By contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), the mass of descending duodenum was now measured 81 mm × 62 mm. Its appearance bordered on high-density, with a low-density mass inside (). Findings were suggestive of rupture, accompanied by hematocele, accumulated exudate, and ascites.
Four hours following EUS-FNA, emergency surgery was performed, and the clinical impressions were confirmed. The abdominal cavity contained approximately 1000 ml of blood. Consequently, the tumor was completely resected.
Immunohistochemical staining of the lesion was positive for CD-117, CD-34, and DOG-1 markers, as well as for smooth muscle actin. Positivity of Ki67 was <5%, and staining for Desmin was negative. A diagnosis of high-risk duodenal stromal tumor was ultimately rendered.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 19-year-old female patient visited the Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Cheju Halla General Hospital, due to oozing and severe eczematous lesions mainly on the face with a history of atopic dermatitis. She had been treated with standard symptomatic therapy including antihistamines and steroids with persistent fluctuation of symptoms and signs. All patients in this report fulfilled the Haniffin and Rajka criteria. All four patients had no past medical history except atopic dermatitis from infancy. The clinical severity score was evaluated before and after treatment using SCORAD. The total score was 103 points. Basic allergic tests (blood tests and skin prick test) were conducted on all three patients before and after treatment. They received blood tests for a complete blood count with differential, serum eosinophil cationic protein, and serum total IgE and IgE levels for specific allergens using a multiple allergosorbent test (MAST, Green Cross PD). In the MAST test, the specific IgEs for 41 allergens were evaluated, including Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp), D farina (Df), cat, dog, egg white, milk, soybean, crab, shrimp, peach, mackerel, rye pollen, house dust mites, cockroach, Clasporium herbarum, Aspergillus fumigatus, Alternaria alternata, birch-alder mix, white oak, short ragweed, mugwort, Japanese hop, hazelnut, sweet vernal grass, Bermuda grass, orchard grass, timothy grass, reed, Penicillium notatum, sycamore, sallow willow, poplar mix, ash mix, pine, Japanese cedar, acacia, oxeye daisy, dandelion, Russian thistle, goldenrod, and pigweed. The test results show the level of specific IgE for each allergen, and a normal negative range is 0.000-0.349 IU/mL.
A skin prick test was also performed for 53 allergens. The allergens tested by the skin prick test were A alternaria, A fumigatus, A nigre, Candida albicans, Cladosporium, P chrysogenum, German cockroach, Dp, Df, dog, cat, grey elder/silver birch, grass mix, mugwort, short ragweed, black willow pollen, orchard grass, Bermuda grass, timothy, English plantain, English rye grass, Holm oak, Japanese cedar, cotton flock, milk mix, egg mix, chicken, beef, pork, cod, oyster, salmon, prawn, mackerel, tuna, almond, peanut, bean, carrot, cabbage, walnut, maize, peach, tomato, black pepper, spinach, wheat flour, rabbit, kapok, hop, F acacia, pine, and poplar. Skin prick tests are performed on the upper back between the scapular spine and L1 spine. The area to be tested was cleaned with alcohol and coded with a skin marker pen corresponding to the number of allergens being tested. The marks were 2 cm apart. A drop of allergen solution is placed beside each mark. A small prick through the drop is made to the skin using a Morrow Brown Needle® (Morrow Brown® Allergy Diagnostics) by holding the needle perpendicular to the test site and punching firmly through testing extract and into epidermis. The drop was removed immediately after the skin has been pricked, and the used needle was discarded immediately. Histamine hydrochloride 1 mg/mL was used as a positive control, and physiologic saline was used as a negative control. The results were measured as the wheal size. Reactions were read after 15 minutes and described as negative (0, no reaction), 1+ (reaction greater than control reaction but smaller than half the size of histamine), 2+ (equal to or more than half the size of histamine), 3+ (equal to or more than the size of histamine), and 4+ (equal to or more than twice the size of histamine). The minimum size of a positive reaction is 3 mm.
Patients received 2 mL of Histobulin (12 mg human immunoglobulin/0.15 μg histamine complex) by subcutaneous injection in the deltoid areas of upper arm every week for 24 or 36 times. All patients stopped to take antihistamine at least a week before Histobulin therapy.
Her clinical severity was improved from 42.5 to 0 (points), and her atopic dermatitis was remitted clinically after 36 Histobulin injections. The clinical severity scores, laboratory test results, and skin test results before and after treatment are shown in Figure . Her atopic dermatitis was remitted after 36 Histobulin injections (Figure ). In the MAST, specific IgE for allergens was not detected, and in the skin prick test, only Japanese cedar was positive as 2 + before and after treatment. The URI frequency was decreased, and she did not suffer from URI for 1 year including the treatment period.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 78-year-old male presented with chief complaint of chronic and worsening left hip pain. Relevant history included an intertrochanteric hip fracture that had been treated one year prior with a cephalomedullary nail. Prior to hip fracture, the patient could walk without any assistive devices and was a high-functioning community ambulatory. Following the injury, the patient was limited to ambulation with the assistance of a walker. On physical examination, the left leg was significantly shorter than the right leg. Range of motion revealed an extremely limited range of the hip and impingement testing was positive. Infectious workup was negative for an infectious source. Neurological testing was unremarkable. Radiographs of the pelvis were obtained and demonstrated a hip fracture with a non-union of the intertrochanteric region of the femur, as well as penetration of the head screw through the femoral head. There was also screw penetration into the acetabulum and an LLD radiographically measured at 45 mm (Table ).
The preoperative plan included left hip THA. During surgery, computer-assisted navigation was used to assist with component placement and monitoring of changes in leg length. Intraoperative navigation measurements indicated a lengthening of 35 mm, which was confirmed on post-operative radiographs. Surgery was successful and the patient progressed well, experiencing significant pain relief and satisfaction with his surgery. He was discharged to home with a walker and within six weeks of follow-up, the patient had transitioned to walking with only a cane. At three months the patient was no longer using any assistive walking devices and at one year follow-up the patient was pain free and returned to his previous level of function prior to the hip fracture. Radiographs revealed that the left hip was well-aligned, with the left leg lengthened by 35 mm for a significantly improved post-operative LLD of 10 mm (Table , Figure ).","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 69-year-old female (patient 1 in ) developed a gait disturbance 6 months before admission and suffered from the gradual progression of weakness in her extremities. On admission, neurological examination showed proximal muscle weakness and reduced deep tendon reflex. Routine laboratory test results were unremarkable. Antinuclear antibodies, anti-acetylcholine (ACh) receptor antibody, and anti-voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibodies were negative. The results of chest and abdominal CT were unremarkable. In a nerve conduction study, CMAPs had slightly low amplitudes, and nerve conduction velocities were normal in the median and ulnar nerves. Needle EMG showed early recruitment and polyphasic MUPs with short durations and low amplitudes, suggesting the diagnosis of myopathy. Interestingly, the myopathic EMG findings were improved after sustained strong muscle contraction for 10 s; the MUP sizes returned to normal after a sustained strong muscle contraction, and the early recruitment of MUPs in the weak contraction was clearly normalized in the biceps brachii muscle (). Thereafter, we performed an RNS test because she complained of easy fatigability. The RNS test showed an obvious incremental response of the CMAP amplitude of the abductor digiti minimi muscle after high-rate stimulation of the ulnar nerve, indicating the diagnosis of LEMS [–]. We examined the patient for systemic malignancies, and the endoscopic examination of the colon revealed adenocarcinoma in the sigmoid colon. Her muscle weakness slightly improved after resection of the colon cancer.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 54-year-old male reported to our department with history of swelling over the right side of face since 5 years. The patient reported insidious onset of swelling with a gradual progress to the present size. He also reported mild, intermittent, and dull pain in the region of swelling.
Clinical examination confirmed a solitary, oval, well-defined swelling measuring approximately 7 × 5 cm in the preauricular region []. The surface over the swelling was smooth without any secondary changes. It extended superioinferiorly from the level of outer canthus of the eye to inferior border of mandible and anterioposteriorly extended from 2 cm in front of anterior border of ramus to the mastoid notch []. On palpation, the swelling was firm, non-tender, free from skin, and mobile over the underlying structures. Mild pulsations could be appreciated from the swelling. There was no weakness of facial muscles or enlargement of swelling during mastication.
Ultrasonography revealed a large lobulated solid mass of 6 × 4 cm in the right parotid region with multiple vessels with low velocity flow and without any areas of calcification or cystic changes. Findings were suggestive of a low-grade vascular tumor.[] Computed tomography scan with contrast medium revealed a large well-circumscribed, solitary isodense lesion measuring 6.36 × 4.39 cm []. It was observed to be extending anteriorly over the superficial lobe of the parotid gland, with anterior displacement of parotid gland. A diagnosis of mixed parotid tumor was made.[] FNAC revealed numerous vascular channels with occasional singly scattered and single cluster of plump spindle cells. Based on these findings, a lesion of vascular origin was suggested.
Classical superficial parotidectomy was performed under general anesthesia using a modified Appiani incision. Tumor mass was dissected anteriorly and excised along with the superficial lobe of parotid gland []. Facial nerve was located using the anterograde method and all the branches of facial nerve were preserved. Post-operative recovery was uneventful. Upon six months of follow up, facial nerve function was intact and no sign of reoccurrence was observed.
Histopathological sections revealed connective tissue with numerous vascular spaces of variable sizes ranging from small capillary-like vessels to partly lined vessels. Around the endothelial cells, few vascular spaces showed a rim of circumscribed smooth muscle cells. The supporting connective tissue stroma appeared immature and fibromyxoid with sparse cellularity. Cells were plump or stellate-shaped with mild inflammatory cell response and composed predominantly of plasma cells and a few lymphoid follicles []. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong uptake of CD34 in the endothelial cells [].[] Findings were suggestive of a vascular lesion compatible with diagnosis of ENA.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A-52-year old woman presented with 3-year history of fullness and dull pain involving the left knee. She had been aware of a mass in the knee joint that had been progressively increasing in size. She was unable to flex her knee, sit cross-legged, or squat. There was no history of trauma or constitutional symptoms.
On physical examination, there were fullness on the medial aspect of left knee and palpable nodular mass of approximately 6 × 4 cm over the infrapatellar region medial to the patellar tendon (). The mass was nontender with no local warmth, bony hard in consistency, and immobile. The mass was more prominent on flexion than on extension of knee. The range of motion of the knee joint was limited to 100° of active flexion. Neurovascular examination was normal. Plain radiographs of the knee revealed a mineralized mass situated between the anterior tibial tubercle and the patella. The mass appeared to occupy the entire region of the infrapatellar fat pad. The femoral condyles and tibial plateau were normal (Figures and ). Subsequently an MRI was performed. MRI revealed a large mineralized mass lying in the Hoffa body with no attachment to the skeletal tissue (). It was decided to perform an excision biopsy.
Under regional anaesthesia with the patient supine in a bloodless field furnished by a pneumatic tourniquet, a 7 cm longitudinal incision was made medial to the patellar tendon. The mass was lying medially and behind the patellar tendon in Hoffa's fat pushing the tendon laterally () and impinging on medial femoral condyle and intercondylar notch (). It was dissected and excised in toto (Figures and ). The medial tibial plateau, patella, menisci, and the patellar tendon were not involved in the process. The mass did not involve the joint space or synovium and was not continuous with femur, tibia, or patella but rather originated from joint capsule and was completely intra-articular. The capsule and the subcutaneous tissue were sutured with 1/0 vicryl and skin with 2/0 ethilon. 12 G drain was kept. Compression dressing was applied. Weight bearing was allowed in the immediate postoperative period.
Postoperative recovery was uneventful. Sutures were removed on the 12th postoperative period. The patient returned to her daily activities regaining full flexion within two weeks after surgery. She was on regular followup. When last reviewed 24 months after excision, she was asymptomatic with no clinical and radiographic signs of recurrence of the lesion (Figures , (1), and (2)).
Grossly, the resected specimen measured 7 × 6 × 5 cm with a large cartilaginous cap and was surrounded by adipose tissue and a fibrous capsule. Histologically, the cut sections showed numerous lamellar bony trabeculae with mature cartilaginous cap. Fibrofatty tissue was seen at the periphery (). There were foci of active endochondral ossification without any evidence of malignancy. No mitotic figures were seen.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 24-year-old native Japanese man presented to our hospital after developing high-grade fever. He had travelled to Vietnam and Cambodia for 14 days. After leaving Japan, he visited the beach in Halong Bay, the forest region near the border of China, and Siem Reap in Cambodia. During his stay, he had participated in forest trekking tourism and had stayed in a youth hostel. For dietary intake, he ate home-cooked food and drank beverages with ice, in a similar manner to local people. Fourteen days after he returned to Japan, he developed a mild headache, chills and malaise, and 2 days later, he developed a high fever with chills and rigors. He did not have any abdominal pain or diarrhoea. His past medical history, family history and social history were unremarkable. On examination, his temperature was 39 ℃, his blood pressure was 128/68 mmHg, his pulse was 101 beats per minute, his respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute and his oxygen saturation was 98 % with room air. He did not present a rash, lymph node swelling, abdominal tenderness, or hepatosplenomegaly. His laboratory examination demonstrated elevated serum C-reactive protein (5.1 mg dl−1; normal range, 0–0.3 mg dl−1). The blood cell counts and the other biochemical tests were normal (WBC 6900 µl−1, AST 20 U l−1, ALT 19 U l−1). The HIV test result was negative, while contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed ileocecal lymphadenopathy. We did not detect enterocolitis, arthritis, or abscesses. We also did not detect an aneurysm or abscess via brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Based on his travel history and clinical findings, we suspected primary bacteraemia from typhoid fever. He was admitted to our hospital for observation and treated with antibiotics. On the day of admission, ceftriaxone (2 g/day) and minocycline (200 mg/day) were administered. On hospital day two, the initial blood cultures yielded Gram-negative bacilli, which were identified as by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The bacterial subspecies could not be identified by biochemical testing at our hospital. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed that the organism was not resistant to the following antibiotics: ampicillin, piperacillin, cefotiam, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, azythromycin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and fosfomycin. Only minomycin had an MIC90 value of >8 µg ml−1.
After 1 day of ceftriaxone and minocycline, his fever, malaise and headache remitted. We discontinued minocycline, and ceftriaxone was continued for 14 days. The patient was discharged on day 10 and had an uneventful recovery with no recurrence of fever.
Further testing using commercial O and H antisera (Denka Seiken Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) according to the Antigenic Formulae of the (9th ed.) [] identified the organism as serovar Corvallis (at Hokkaido Institute of Public Health, Sapporo, Japan). Thus, serovar Corvallis was likely to have caused the primary bacteraemia in this patient, as described.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"Patient one was a 52-month old male with bilateral RB at the time of infarct diagnosis in his right eye. He was homozygous for the C677T polymorphism, and experienced choroidal ischemia after his seventh dose of OAC (carboplatin, topotecan, and melphalan) to the right eye only. His prior six OAC doses were unremarkable except for vasospasm of the ophthalmic artery during the fifth dose, which limited the ability for simultaneous bilateral chemotherapy infusion. The seventh dose, however, was his first administration of nitrous oxide during the procedure; he received 24 min of nitrous oxide induction anesthesia with a maximum end tidal nitrous oxide (ET N2O) of 60.2% (higher ET N2O percentage correlates to higher nitrous oxide concentration in the blood). He experienced no intra-procedural complications. One month later, new choroidal ischemia was identified in the right eye, presumed to be due to an infarction.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 68-year-old man presented with acute swelling of his right scrotum with obvious pain. His body temperature was 38.4°C. After physical and radiological examinations, the patient was diagnosed with right epididymitis with an abscess. He was admitted to the urological surgery department for antibacterial therapy for two weeks. Subsequently, he underwent a resection of the right epididymis and abscess. However, 24 hours after surgery, he experienced septic shock and was transferred to the intensive care unit for further treatment. A blood culture suggested a Klebsiella pneumoniae infection (KPI). The patient was treated with cefepime, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and tigecycline, but his symptoms did not improve. Subsequently, he was confirmed to have multidrug-resistant KPI. Polymyxin B (500,000 units, intravenous, q 12 hours) was administered with meropenem (2 g, intravenous, q 8 hours) and tigecycline (100 mg, intravenous, q 12 hours), and his symptoms improved. On the 8th day of polymyxin B therapy, the patient developed a red, scattered, dotted, pruritic rash on his trunk and limbs. On the 14th day of polymyxin B therapy, the rash subsided and the pruritus slightly improved; however, the patient's face and neck changed from a normal yellow color to a slightly black color. Despite this adverse event, polymyxin B therapy was continued for a total of 17 days due to its effectiveness against the multidrug-resistant KPI. Seven days after the withdrawal of polymyxin B, the color of the patient's face and neck was completely black (). The patient's scalp and feet underwent desquamation, which lasted for 10 days. Cod liver oil ointment was administered three times a day to lubricate and protect the newly grown epidermis. The patient was advised to let the skin layer fall off naturally and not to peel it in order to prevent a skin infection.
One nurse was assigned to care for the patient and record the changes in hyperpigmentation daily. The patient and his family were counseled regarding the psychological effects of the hyperpigmentation. Twenty-four days after the withdrawal of polymyxin B, the skin around the patient's eyes and nose began to fade significantly, followed gradually by the whole face and neck. The desquamation of the patient's feet improved. Sixty days after the withdrawal of polymyxin B, the hyperpigmentation of the patient's face and neck skin was almost entirely resolved ().","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 43-year-old healthy Caucasian female presented to primary care with short (7–10 days), recurrent flares of lower extremity tenderness, swelling, and redness over several months. She also reported myalgias in the upper back and neck, and a one-year history of headache with transient, reoccurring curtain-like visual disturbances in her right eye that ophthalmology diagnosed as ocular migraines. A rheumatologic workup was initiated. Labs were positive for an elevated sedimentation rate (ESR) 31 mm/H (normal 0–20 mmH), positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA), and an elevated ribonucleoprotein antibodies (RNP) 2.4 AI (reference <1.0 AI). Double-stranded (DS) DNA 1 IU/mL (<4 = Neg), antichromatin (AC), anti-Smith (SM), SM/RNP, and lyme disease antibodies were negative. Based on these results, the patient received a presumptive diagnosis of undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD), started 20 mg of oral prednisone as needed for flares, and referred to rheumatology.
Two months after her initial evaluation, the patient continued to experience episodes or erythema nodosum of the lower extremities. She also began to experience early signs of Raynaud's phenomenon, chest pain, and visual disturbances concerning for amaurosis fugax. A personal symptom journal kept by the patient indicated transient episodes of fatigue and painful hand/finger swelling with petechiae and purpura. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was ordered, and repeat labs done by rheumatology showed an elevated ESR, 39 mm/H; RNP, 1.8 AI; CRP, 3.7 (normal <0.8 mg/dL); and a negative antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), myeloperoxidase antibodies, proteinase-3 antibodies, and ANA. Complement C3, 118 mg/dL (normal 90–180 mg/dL), and C4, 29 mg/dL (normal 16–47 mg/dL), were within normal limits. The patient was referred for further evaluation at an academic medical center.
The MRI showed a 6 mm lacunar infarct within the left cerebellum and a 12 mm hemorrhage along a cortical sulcus of the right frontal lobe. The findings were noted to be “abnormal” for a woman in her early forties, and a further work was recommended for vasculitis and/or connective tissue disease via magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). The MRA and ophthalmological assessment were unremarkable, and cardiology found no evidence of vascular disease on carotid ultrasound and no evidence of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia on stress echocardiogram.
A second rheumatological consult was completed where concern for possible evolving MCTD was raised; however, the diagnosis of UCTD was retained due to the negative ANA. Seven months following her initial presentation, the patient saw neurology where she reported worsening lightheadedness and 6-7/10 bifrontal/apical headaches lasting hours to days over the previous month. Despite the history of arthralgias/myalgias, purpura, chest pain, evidence of cerebral hemorrhage, and initial labs showing nonspecific inflammation and markers of autoimmunity, vasculitis was considered low on the differential due to a lack of a clear prodromal history and changes in cognition. Similarly, neuro-ophthalmology found no definite retinal vasculitis and believed her homonymous right visual field defect to be associated with the brain lesion previously appreciated on MRI and not amaurosis fugax. A nonemergent repeat MRI with contrast and an MR venogram of the brain were ordered by neurology to rule out thrombosis and evaluate for new lesions.
Approximately two months after her neurology appointment, the patient presented to the emergency room with a severe, right-sided headache with a left-sided visual disturbance. Shortly after arrival, the patient became delirious and exhibited seizure-like activity. A computerized tomography scan (CT) of the brain was conducted that showed a right parietal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage approximately 5 × 3 × 5 cm in size with secondary mass effect including mid- and hind-brain herniation (see ). A CTA showed multifocal narrowing and an abnormal “beaded” contour of the entire cerebral arterial vasculature consistent for vasculitis. Neurosurgical assets were not available, and the patient was transferred to a sister center where craniectomy was performed to evacuate intracerebral hemorrhage and treat intracranial hypertension (see ). Postoperative prognosis was poor, and palliative measures were initiated. The patient passed away peacefully surrounded by family several days later.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year. Exclusion Criteria: Younger than 65 years old, having decompensated liver disease, psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance, having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy.",1
"An 8-year old male child presented after 10 days of sustaining electric burn over left forearm, chest, and abdominal wall. He sustained electrical burn accidently after touching electrical cable which was described as low voltage current. After sustaining electric burn, patient was brought to the private hospital. They managed patient with dressing and medications. There were no abdominal complaints at that time so he was discharged. After a week he developed abdominal pain with distension. On examination, there was necrosis of skin with eschar on the left lower abdomen with entry wound on left forearm and exit wound over left lower abdomen. He was dehydrated with pulse 100/mint. It was 2nd degree burn. Abdomen was distended and tender. On investigation hemoglobin was 11.7 gm%, TLC- 17000/mm3, serum electrolytes, liver function test, serum amylase and lipase were in normal limits. In urine analysis albumin was present. ECG was normal. Ultrasound abdomen showed thick inter-loop collection, dilatation of small bowel loops, and collapsed colon. X-ray abdomen revealed free gas under both domes of diaphragm. He was diagnosed as having bowel perforation leading to peritonitis. Immediate exploratory laparotomy was performed. There was around 50 cc of bilious fluid in peritoneal cavity with plenty of flakes over intestine. On further exploration, a perforation (0.5x0.5cm) found in the proximal ileum. Refreshing of the margins of perforation was done and primary closure performed (Fig. 1). Patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on 7th postoperative day. Electric burn healed at the time of discharge. At follow up patient remained healthy.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 31-year-old, ASA II, superobese male patient (190 kg, 180 cm, BMI: 58 kg/m2) was admitted to the emergency department with a segmental Gustilo-Anderson type IIIA open tibial fracture and ankle dislocation following an in-vehicle traffic accident. The initial proper management of open fracture and joint dislocation was performed by orthopaedic and traumatology surgeons in the emergency department. The patient had no history of additional diseases. The preoperative airway examination revealed a class 3 Mallampati airway and, in light of the difficulty of intubation, an intrathecal block with a 150 mm needle was planned. After the written consent was obtained, 2 mg IV midazolam and 50 μg fentanyl were administered for sedation. The vertebral anatomical structures were barely distinguishable despite ultrasound guidance. After two unsuccessful attempts, we decided not to use spinal anesthesia and planned to perform a combined sciatic and femoral nerve block. As a tourniquet was not required above the knee, the blockade of these two nerves would be adequate for surgical anesthesia.
Before the femoral nerve block, the pannus was taped cephalad as the fatty tissue hanging from the abdomen made it difficult to access the inguinal region. The femoral nerve was identified at a depth of 5 cm with a linear US probe (Esaote, 10–18 MHz, Florence, Italy). Fifteen mL (8 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine and 7 mL of 2% lidocaine) of local anesthetic mixture was administered around the femoral nerve using the in-plane approach. Due to the difficulties in situating the patient in the prone position, the distal extremities of the patient were elevated with folded blankets in the supine position (). The sciatic nerve could not be visualized despite several attempts using both linear and convex probes; therefore separate blocks of the tibial and common peroneal nerves were planned. The tibial nerve was identified in the popliteal fold, posterior to the popliteal artery at a depth of 3 cm (). Visualization of the tibial nerve was highly difficult in areas more proximal than the point 2 cm above the popliteal fossa. The common peroneal nerve (CPN) and the bifurcation of the sciatic nerve could not be visualized despite several attempts using both linear and convex probes. Therefore, 10 mL (7 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine and 3 mL of 2% lidocaine) of local anesthetic mixture was administered around the tibial nerve 2 cm above the popliteal fold by using a linear probe. Screening was performed in the distal direction over the lateral side of the patient's leg with the linear probe placed transversely on the edge of the patella to identify the CPN (). The nerve was visualized posteriorly and laterally to the fibular head, 4 cm distally to the edge of the patella at a depth of 2 cm (). At this level, 10 mL (7 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine and 3 mL of 2% lidocaine) of local anesthetic mixture was administered around the nerve with the in-plane technique using a linear probe. A 100 mm 21-G echogenic needle (Pajunk, Geisingen, Germany) was used for all blocks. A nerve stimulator was not used for any blocks since the patient had extremity pain associated with trauma. Surgical anesthesia was established within 30 minutes after anesthetic administration and no complications occurred in association with the blocks. Emergent reduction and fixation with an external fixator were performed for the ankle dislocation and fracture of the tibia. Additional local anesthetic injection or additional sedation was not required during the operation. The operation lasted for approximately 1.5 hours and was completed without problems. The patient's consent was obtained for the publication of this case report.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"We present the case of a 74-year-old Caucasian male presenting with a 2-year history of left knee pain. He described difficulty kneeling and descending stairs. On examination, a tender and mildly diffuse swelling was present over the left patella associated with mild erythema. The patient was able to perform a straight leg raise test and had full range of movement of the left knee. Ligamentous and meniscal testing was unremarkable as was examination of the ipsilateral hip.
Nineteen months earlier the patient had consulted his general practitioner complaining of left knee pain. Radiographs performed at that time were reported to show joint space narrowing within the patello-femoral compartment as well as early joint space narrowing within the medial compartment. A subchondral lucency was also noted within the patella which was described as a subarticular cyst secondary to the previously mentioned patello-femoral degeneration (Figs –).
The patient had a past history of prostate cancer, diagnosed in October 2005. He had been successfully treated and discharged from follow-up. In August 2007 he underwent excision of a basal cell carcinoma and had a permanent pacemaker for bradyarrhythmia. His only regular medication was a statin. Overall, he enjoyed good health and considered himself very active. There were no symptoms or signs of systemic disease.
Repeat radiographs performed by his general practitioner 19 months after initial presentation (Figs –) revealed a large lucency within the patella and a discontinuity in the anterior cortex of the inferior pole suggesting pathological fracture. A bone scan was arranged and demonstrated isolated abnormal tracer activity around the left patella (Fig. ). Due to the pacemaker a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed to further characterize the lesion. This confirmed a large lucent area occupying most of the patella with multiple areas of cortical disruption along its anterior border (Fig. ). Since the exact nature of the lesion could not be determined an ultrasound-guided biopsy was suggested but ultrasound screening revealed the lesion to be highly vascular (Fig. ). In view of this the radiologist performed a renal ultrasound, which revealed a large mass arising from the superior pole of the left kidney. Subsequent CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis followed demonstrating the extent of disease. There was a large (13 × 8.5 × 9 cm) mass arising from the superior pole of the left kidney (Fig. ), the appearances of which were consistent with a primary RCC. Metastases were found in both adrenals and lungs, but no other bone metastases. Since diagnosis, the patient has had a left nephrectomy and is currently receiving radiotherapy and zolendronic acid treatment for the patella metastasis. At the time of writing this report the patient's patella lesion continues to be managed non-operatively.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 54-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to chronic, long-standing type II diabetes mellitus presented in January 2011 with decreased urine output and swelling over the whole body for 3 months. He was trained for CAPD in a stable state of health. The patient was compliant with medical care and had been free from peritonitis to date. However, he presented to the nephrology outpatient department in January 2013 with complaints of fever, abdominal pain and cloudy PD effluent. As the abdominal pain worsened, the patient was admitted to the hospital. The patient denied any contact with soil or plant material. His past medical history was uneventful except for diabetes mellitus for the past 11 years. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 140/80 mm Hg−1, temperature 100.8 ° F, pulse 72 min−1 and respiration rate 18 min−1. His head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination was unremarkable. There was no clubbing, cyanosis, lymphadenopathy or icterus. His lungs were clear and no cardiac murmur was heard. His abdomen was tender in all quadrants with rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were present and active. Pertinent laboratory values were Hgm (Hemoglobin) 7.2 gm dl−1, white blood cells (WBCs) 24000 mm−3, platelets 2.28×105 µl−1, serum creatinine 9.3 mg dl−1, serum blood urea nitrogen 45 mg dl−1, serum uric acid 4.9 mg dl−1, serum sodium 131 mmol l−1, serum potassium 3.5 mmol l−1, serum albumin 3.3 g dl−1, serum bilirubin (total) 0.45 mg dl−1, serum aspartate transaminase 19 U l−1, serum alanine aminotransferase 13 U L−1, serum alkaline phosphatase 105 U l−1, serum amylase 29 U L−1, serum calcium 8.9 mg dl−1, serum phosphorus 5 mg dl−1 and serum lactate dehydrogenase 514 U l−1. PD fluid was sent for cell count, Gram stain and culture. The WBC count in PD fluid was 6400 mm−3 with 82% neutrophils. Gram staining of the fluid showed plenty of Gram-negative bacilli. A presumptive diagnosis of CAPD peritonitis was made and empiric intraperitoneal cefazolin and tobramycin were started. PD fluid culture yielded catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, non-spore-forming and non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli. The isolate was positive for urea hydrolysis and nitrate reduction. Negative reactions were found for the production of H2S, indole, lysine decarboxylase and ornithine decarboxylase for the hydrolysis of gelatin. The identity of the isolate was confirmed as R. radiobacter sensitive to trimethoprim/sulfametoxazole, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoperazone-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, imipinem and meropenem. It was resistant only to aztreonam. Empiric antibiotic therapy was continued and the patient’s abdominal pain subsided and the peritoneal fluid counts decreased to 50 WBCs mm−3 on day 4. However, on the eighth hospital day, the patient again complained of abdominal pain and the PD fluid count increased to 300 WBCs mm−3. The catheter was therefore surgically removed and the tip sent for culture. The tip yielded growth of R. radiobacter.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission. Exclusion Criteria: Individuals under 18 years of age, COVID-19 infection, Infection of the skin at the CGM site requiring removal of the sensor, Patients with altered Mental Status, Patients unable to scan their flash CGMs at least every 8 hours, Inability to provide written consent, Hospitalized for less than 24 hours.",1
"A 76-year-old male presented with a six-month history of pain in his right knee joint. The pain occurred insidiously without any antecedent trauma. He exhibited no signs of meniscal tear, ligamentous injury, or limitation of motion, but had pain on terminal extension. He also complained of intermittent pain while walking, but he denied any pain at rest or constitutional symptoms.
An initial physical examination showed no specific swelling of the right knee joint. He experienced anterior knee pain on terminal extension with a limited knee extension of 10°. The patient showed neither ligamentous instability nor positive findings on mechanical tests.
Simple radiographs of the knee showed no definite osteoarthritic change on the tibiofemoal joint or a soft tissue density lesion, although small calcification was observed on the suprapatellar pouch (). T1-weighted MRI scans of the right knee joint showed a lobulated, well-defined mass in the IFP with intermediate signal intensity, whereas T2-weighted images showed homogeneous and relatively high signal intensity but no hypointense areas such as calcified nodules or hemosiderin deposits. Both T1 and T2 weighted images showed that the mass was bisected by band-like septa of low signal intensity ().
The patient underwent arthroscopic excision. Conventional anteromedial and anterolateral portals were introduced to confirm the preoperative MRI findings. Far medial and far lateral portals were made to clearly visualize the mass and thoroughly remove it arthroscopically. The arthroscopic findings showed a whitish, ovoid-shaped mass buried in the IFP ().
After debridement of some of the fat pad adjacent to the mass, a freely movable large-sized mass was exposed (). The mass was completely excised with a punch and shaver and completely removed. No damage to the cruciate ligament was found but mild osteoarthritic changes, considering the old age, were shown, such as minimal meniscus tear and articular cartilage wear. Histopathological examination of the mass showed unevenly distributed plump chondrocytes with cellular atypia, some binucleated, within irregularly-shaped nests of cells. Neither zonal ring-like calcification nor enchondral ossification was observed (). These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of primary synovial chondromatosis. At 20-month follow-up, the patient was taking part in normal daily activities.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 55-year-old man with a weight of 76 kg and height of 178 cm, suddenly experienced a nontraumatic loss of consciousness after a cough attack at an upright position as reported by a witness. Two months prior, he was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and had been receiving antituberculosis treatment. On arrival, the patient was unconscious with a Glasgow coma scale score of 6, blood pressure of 169/89 mm Hg, regular heart rate of 85 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 18/minute, body temperature of 36.5°C, SaO2 of 82% at room air, and capillary blood sugar of 110 mg/dL. Auscultation of the lungs revealed an inspiratory crackle at the left lung field. After rapid intravenous access and oxygenation, the patient was sedated, the trachea was intubated, mechanical ventilation was initiated, and conservative treatment was maintained in the intensive care unit. Urgent computed tomography (CT) of the brain was performed and showed multiple air shadows in both hemispheres and the right cerebral vessels (). These lesions suggest air embolism. Twelve hours later, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed and showed a diffuse ischemic stroke in the right and left frontoparietal cortical areas and multiple hypointense signals, which were consistent with cerebral air embolism ().
The brain perfusion images were normal. The chest CT performed at the emergency department showed pulmonary tuberculosis cavity associated with the destruction of parenchyma in the left upper lobe (). There was no evidence of cerebral hemorrhage. The diagnosis of cerebral gas embolism after sudden cough was retained, and immediate treatment was started including 100% oxygen and cardiovascular support while the patient was placed in a supine position. The transthoracic echocardiography was performed, and no patent foramen ovale was found. A lumbar puncture was performed to seek for tuberculous meningoencephalitis. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was considered, but the patient’s condition was too unstable to support transfer to the hyperbaric oxygen center. One day later, his neurological status deteriorated. The patient died on the fourth day with multiple organ failure. No autopsy was performed based on his family’s wishes.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 45-year-old male underwent a left upper lobectomy and postoperative pathology revealed invasive stage IIIA lung adenocarcinoma (). Targeted next- generation sequencing (NGS) with a customized panel (Geneseeq Prime panel) designed to target 425 cancer-specific genes was performed, and four somatic mutations and copy number alterations (CNAs) were identified, including EGFR-KDD of exon 18-25 [mutant allele frequency (MAF): 13.5%], EGFR amplification (4.5-fold), TP53 p.Y220C (MAF: 37.0%), and RB1 single copy loss (). The tumor mutation burden (TMB) was estimated to be 1.1 mutation/Mb. The patient received pemetrexed and cisplatin as adjuvant chemotherapy. Four months later, he progressed with liver metastasis in left lobe ().
Then, the patient was treated with Icotinib and the metastasis shrunk. Unfortunately, the drug resistance was observed only after 4 months, as evidenced by the fact that previously responsive liver lesion progressed. Left hepatic re-biopsy confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma and target sequencing (Geneseeq Prime panel) detected the same EGFR-KDD (MAF: 4.9%) as well as mutation of TP53 p.Y220C (MAF: 0.5%) (). The TMB was calculated as 2.2 mutation/Mb.
Docetaxel and cisplatin were initiated as the second-line therapy. However, the left hepatic metastasis enlarged rapidly after 2 cycles of chemotherapy. The blood carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level increased from 9.5 mg/ml (before chemotherapy) to 22.7 mg/ml. Even worse, a right hepatic metastasis appeared soon afterward. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of liver was conducted on both of the left and right hepatic metastases, but no reduction in liver lesions was observed, and the CEA level showed a slight increase from 7.3 to 10.3 mg/ml.
Afterward, the patient started taking Osimertinib (80 mg once daily). Encouragingly, both liver lesions showed significant regression (). One month after initiation of Osimertinib, the CEA level decreased to 5.4 mg/ml, and remained at normal level for 18 months. Moreover, the progression-free survival (PFS) reached 21 months. However, the CEA level increased to 23.1 mg/ml at the 19th month after the initiation of Osimertinib treatment, and 2 months later, the patient progressed with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes () with the CEA level of 73.9 mg/ml. Resampling and targeted sequencing (Geneseeq Prime panel) consistently identified EGFR-KDD (MAF: 33.9%), as well as EGFR amplification (6.6-fold), TP53 p.Y220C (MAF: 53.3%), and a new mutation of RELN p.G1774E (MAF: 45.4%) (). The estimated TMB increased to 3.4 mutation/Mb. In addition, the assessment of PD-L1 expression using antibody 28-8 (pharm Dx, Dako’s Platform) showed tumor proportion score (TPS) of 1%.
On these bases, the fourth-line salvage therapy using Nivolumab was prescribed and the therapeutic efficacy was considerable, as evidenced by the decreased CEA, regressed mediastinal lymph nodes, reduced metastases in both left and right liver (). Specifically, the CEA level decreased from 143.6 to 41.8 mg/ml one month later. The PFS reached 7 months and no obvious adverse effects were observed. The quality of life was in good status during the Nivolumab treatment. After that, the patient progressed with enlarged liver metastasis. Unfortunately, the patient was also infected with tuberculosis, and his condition took a sharp turn for the worse due to both tumor progression and tuberculosis. The families gave up further treatment and the patient died 4 months later.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 5.5-year-old boy visited the Endocrinological section of the Pediatric Unit of the General Hospital of Terni, Italy, due to short stature. His mother's height was 170 cm, and his father's height was 172 cm (target height: 177.5 cm = >50° centile). In his family history, there was paternal familiarity for psychotic crises in his adolescence and mother with thrombophilia and history of five pregnancies with three spontaneous abortions and two parts. The mother took cardioaspirine during the pregnancy. No genetic disease was reported in his family. The child was born at term via spontaneous vaginal delivery. The birth weight was 3.050 gr (10°-25° centile), and the birth length was 45 cm (below the third centile). A villocentesis performed at week 12 of gestation due to an alteration in nuchal translucency on obstetric ultrasound did not reveal any abnormality (46, XY). After birth, a small ventricular septal defect and mild bilateral pyelectasis were detected, but within 6 months, both of these abnormalities spontaneously disappeared. Bilateral orchiopexy was performed at 19 months of age for undescended testicles. Regarding linear growth, auxological data recorded by the primary care pediatrician revealed short stature that was 2 standard deviation (SD) below the 3° centile on the Italian cross-sectional growth charts for height () since the first months of life. In the last 2 years, the child has exhibited an even more exacerbated decline in his growth curve. Before entering the hospital, first-level laboratory tests for the evaluation of short stature (i.e., full blood count, inflammatory markers, renal function, hepatic function, coeliac screening, and thyroid function tests) had been already performed. No abnormal results were evidenced. The bone age was delayed by 2 years.
In the hospital, his height was 99.2 cm (<3 SD), his weight was 15.5 kg (<3° centile), and his growth velocity was 4 cm/year (<3° centile). His arm span was of 94 cm, and his sitting height was of 55 cm: height ratio was <95%, his sitting height: height ratio was therefore >56% (slightly over the upper normal limit of 55.5%), and his body mass index was below the 50th centile (pathological Rappold index >8). Furthermore, he presented with unusual facial features that included hypertelorism, low-set ears, a low posterior hairline, down-slanting palpebral fissures, pectus excavatum, and ogival palate (Figure ).
However, Madelung deformity was not suggested by clinical examination and not detected by wrist X-ray findings. Radiological and laboratory tests to rule out related renal, cardiac, ophthalmologic, and audiological abnormalities did not find any significant alterations. At an evaluation conducted by an infant neuropsychiatrist, the patient exhibited a mild cognitive impairment compared with the standard for his age that included a prevalent verbal difficulty compatible with the diagnosis of NS. EEG and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging results were normal. The peak growth hormone (GH) value in a clonidine stimulation test was in the normal range (12.7 mg/L). The IGF-1 level was 47 ng/mL (normal values for age: 32–259 ng/mL).
Although short stature was disproportionate, diagnosis of NS was suspected, and genetic tests of the PTPN11 gene were requested. The entire coding regions and intron-exon boundaries of the PTPN11 gene were amplificated by polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA and sequence specific primers. Both forward and reverse strands were directly sequenced using an automatic DNA sequencer. The results confirmed NS because a c.922A>G (rs28933386) heterozygous mutation in exon 8 of the PTPN11 gene leading to a p.Asn308Asp substitution was identified (reference transcript NCBI NM_002834.3 and NP002825.3). This mutation has already been described as pathogenic by Siegfried et al. ().
Due to the presence of a mesomelic short stature, the concurrent presence of two genetic mutations was considered and a genetic evaluation of the SHOX gene was requested. A test of chromosomal microarray analysis performed with the CGH array led to the identification of a micro-duplication at the level of the region PAR 1 (Xp22.33/Yp11.32) extended about 680 kb involving the SHOX gene. The microduplication in the pseudoautosomal region PAR1 has already been described in NS and its clinical significance therefore appears to be certain ().
GH treatment (0.2 mg/kg/wk) was prescribed. At a follow-up assessment 18 months after the initiation of GH treatment (weight-appropriate dosage), the following data were collected: height, 109.8 cm (<2 SD); weight, 18 kg (<3° centile); growth velocity, 7 cm/year (>90° centile); arm span:height ratio, 96%; sitting height:height ratio: 56%. Further evaluations have been scheduled for every 6 months.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"An 86-year-old male was referred to Saitama Medical University Hospital (Moroyama, Saitama, Japan) from a local dentist in July 2015 due to the presence of an intraoral mass. The patient had not noticed the mass until the dentist brought it to his attention. His previous history included transitional cell cancer of the bladder, but his family history was unremarkable. The round mass, measuring 12 mm in diameter, was located in the left buccal mucosa (). The mass was soft, nontender, and nonadherent to the surrounding tissue, and the surface exhibited normal mucosa. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left buccal region showed a mass with intensity lower than that of skeletal muscle tissue on T1-weighted imaging () and with intensity higher than that of adipose tissue on T2-weighted imaging (). This was diagnosed as a benign buccal tumor and was subsequently resected under local anesthesia. The tumor was easily dissected from the surrounding tissue and appeared to be covered with a thin fibrotic capsule. The resected specimen measured 2 cm at its largest diameter () and was filled with glossy, mucoid, and milky white materials (). Microscopically, the tumor cells in the sparse mucoid matrix () exhibited a spindle or stellate shape without nuclear atypia (data not shown). The tumor matrix had abundant collagen fibers and was strongly stained with alcian blue, indicating the presence of acidic polysaccharides (data not shown).

"A 15-year-old East African boy was referred to our hospital with a diagnosis of recurrent TB. Upon review, the patient was found to have a history of productive cough and intermittent low-grade evening fevers for one year and shortness of breath for one week prior to presentation. One year and five months prior to his presentation to our hospital, he had presented to a peripheral hospital with similar symptoms and had been diagnosed with sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and smear-positive TB. He had been treated with anti-TB medications, which brought him only mild relief. Two months after completing anti-TB therapy, his cough and fevers worsened, for which a re-treatment regimen of anti-TB medications, including two months of intramuscular streptomycin, were started on the basis of clinical findings. The sputum examination for AFB had not been repeated. Four months into the course of his second course of anti-TB therapy, the patient stopped taking his medications because he reportedly experienced only mild relief of his symptoms. Repeat Ziehl-Neelsen staining performed two months prior to his admission to our institution was negative for AFB, and no more drugs were given. One week prior to his admission to our hospital, the patient developed progressively worsening shortness of breath, which was even worse while he was lying flat and was associated with dull left-sided chest pain.
His social history was significant for crushing stones (rock cutting) for two years, but he had no history of smoking or working in the mining industry. He had no history of TB or other lung disease in his family.
His physical examination revealed that he was fully conscious, afebrile, slightly wasted, and dyspneic. His oxygen saturation level was 96% on room air, and his other vital signs were normal. His respiratory examination revealed a respiratory rate of 25 cycles/minute and chest bulging on his left side, but his trachea was centrally located. Other findings on the left side included decreased chest expansion, increased tactile vocal fremitus, dull percussion note, and bronchial breath sounds. The rest of the respiratory examination was unremarkable.
The patient was admitted to the medical ward with a diagnosis of recurrent TB with massive left-sided consolidation. A complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 8.7 cells/mm3 with a differential of 69% neutrophils, 23% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, and 1% eosinophils. His hemoglobin level was 10.6 g/dL, and his platelet count was 504 cells/mm3. His erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 20 mm/hour. His renal and liver function tests were within normal ranges. A rapid test for HIV was performed and was negative. Sputum tests for Gram staining and Ziehl-Neelsen staining were both negative. A chest radiograph revealed features of huge left-sided consolidation with complete opacification of the left hemithorax (Figure ). His chest ultrasound revealed that the left lung was completely consolidated. There was no pleural or pericardial effusion, and his right lung was completely normal. Following these examinations, the patient was empirically re-started on the retreatment regimen for recurrent TB, and the cardiothoracic surgery team was consulted about performing a lung biopsy. The cardiothoracic surgery team felt that the patient was too unstable for surgery and requested that medical management be continued until the patient's condition improved.
On hospital day 3, the patient's condition started deteriorating, with worsening shortness of breath, wheezing, and hypoxia (oxygen saturation 82% to 90% on room air). He was admitted to the intensive care unit, where his anti-TB medications were continued, together with oxygen therapy. On hospital day 7, the patient died before any further intervention could be performed.
A post-mortem examination was performed by the hospital's pathologists. As shown in Figures and , the histopathologic examination revealed a huge mass in the left lung with necrosis and suppurative caseation. Microscopic examination of caseous material was negative for AFB. PAS staining was positive and cytological examination revealed yeast cells and capsules of non-viable fungi, suggestive of H. capsulatum. Because of resource limitations at our hospital, no further tests could be performed. The pathologist's impression was that the patient had had pulmonary histoplasmosis.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"Menarche had commenced at age 10 years, and was followed by regular menses. The first 2 HPV4 vaccinations were received at age 14 years and the third vaccine after turning 15 years in 2008 (Department of Health New South Wales. School vaccination programme. Vaccinations administered February 18, May 23, and October 24 in 2008). The patient reports “prior to this, my periods were like clockwork.” The period due after the third vaccination dose was 2 weeks late and was the first late period she had experienced. The next period occurred 2 months later. The next and final menstruation occurred 9 months later, approximately 1 year after completion of the third HPV4 vaccination. Hot flushes developed and 10 kg weight gain was noted over the next year. Previously present acne improved. Pelvic ultrasound was unremarkable apart from a 3.7-mm endometrial width and the absence of visible ovarian follicles. She had not become sexually active, had no history of drug or alcohol usage and there was no history of trauma, surgery or of significant past illness. There was no family history of premature menopause. She was allergic to benzoyl peroxide. POF was diagnosed just before her 17th birthday.
At age 15 years, initial testing was undertaken: testosterone was 1.1 nmol/L (normal range <2.6), sex hormone binding globulin 41 nmol/L (normal range 20-118 nmol/L), free androgen index 2.7% (normal range <7.2%). There is no significant further testing until nearly 17 years of age: prolactin 160 mIU/L (normal range 40-570 mIU/L), thyroid-stimulating hormone 1.1 mIU/L (normal range 0.5-4.5 mIU/L), dihydroepiandrostenedione (DHEA-S) 3.5 µmol/L (normal range 3.6-9.8 µmol/L), androstenedione 1.8 nmol/L (normal range 1.0-11.5 nmol/L), testosterone <0.7 nmol/L (normal range <3.2 nmol/L), serum hormone binding globulin 32 nmol/L (normal range 30-90 nmol/L), free androgen index <2.2%, luteinizing hormone 32.8 IU/L (midcycle range 17.7-47.5; postmenopausal range >9.3 IU/L), follicle-stimulating hormone 73.8 IU/L (midcycle range 9.6-24.1; postmenopausal >50 IU/L), estradiol <100 pmol/L (midcycle range 500-1500; postmenopausal <100 pmol/L). Estradiol (radioimmune assay) <10 pmol/L. Repeated hormone levels 7 weeks later revealed luteinizing hormone 42.9 IU/L, follicle-stimulating hormone 61.8 IU/L, and estradiol 18 pmol/L. Antiovarian antibodies were negative <1:10 and antiadrenal antibodies were negative. Anti-Müllerian hormone level was unrecordable. Bone mineral density scan was reported normal at age 17 years and 1 month (z-score 0.9 for lumbar spine and 1.4 for “whole body”).
When reviewed in the Department of Clinical Endocrinology at Westmead Hospital, New South Wales, it was determined that she would not respond to gonadotropin stimulation for oocyte collection for cryopreservation. She has been counseled about the need for bone preservation and is currently on hormone replacement therapy. This case was reported to the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia in April 2014. No response was received and the case was renotified to the TGA in June 2014 and to the New South Wales Chief Medical Officer. Reference number and notification response are awaited. Consultation for ovarian cryopreservation has commenced.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 66-year-old female presented to our clinic with the mixed diagnosis of essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease, as she had both resting and action components of tremor in bilateral upper extremities with bradykinesia and rigidity that were somewhat improved on levodopa. The tremor was largely refractory to medication and interfered with her quality of life. She underwent bilateral DBS lead electrode implantation targeting the dentatorubrothalamic tract, specifically, the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim), in the thalamus using the standard stereotactic protocol.[] A trajectory through the ventricle was avoided. Normally, we start by implanting the microelectrodes on the more symptomatic side and then proceed to the other side. In this case, three microelectrodes were simultaneously descended to target the left Vim (as her symptoms were worse in her right hand) first, followed by another three microelectrodes to target the right Vim. Their cannulas were used for macrostimulation to assess for improvement and to choose the best trajectory. Electrode placement (Medtronic 3387 model, Minneapolis, MN, USA) then occurred after confirmed improvement in tremor. The rostral ends of the electrodes were left in a subgaleal pocket to be accessed during a subsequent staged procedure for extension and pulse generator placement. The lead placement was verified in the operating room theater with computed tomography (CT) imaging before closure. Surgery was uncomplicated, and the patient remained interactive and conversant throughout. She was admitted to our neurosurgical ICU as per routine. Head CT performed on early postoperative day (POD) 1 was unremarkable []. Physical examination revealed no deficit; the patient complained of headache with some nausea/vomiting. She desired to stay overnight. An examination later on the evening of POD 1 found her to be sleepy, and ultimately lethargic. Stat head CT performed revealed marked left-sided peri-lead edema extending into the centrum semiovale with cystic cavitation and trace right-sided edema []. Physical examination on the morning of POD 2 revealed the patient to be alert but with global aphasia (not following commands and not speaking), right-sided neglect, and plegic right upper extremity. Corticosteroids (IV dexamethasone) were begun early on POD 2. She later became increasingly lethargic, and over concerns for airway protection was intubated. Repeat head CT revealed increased edema.
The critical care team was concerned for fulminant gas- producing bacterial infection as suggested by neuroradiology interpretation of cavitation surrounding one lead and strongly pushed for lead removal, which was resisted. Vancomycin and meropenem were empirically begun. Systemic tests for infection, including C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and white blood cell counts, were normal, as well as blood cultures, which were ultimately negative at 24, 48, and 72 h. Such negative infectious workup and lack of change on serial repeat imaging disproved this idea. Magnetic resonance imaging could not be performed due to safety concerns at our institution with an incomplete DBS circuit. Acute venous infarction was also considered a possibility, but the radiological appearance of a cortical- subcortical typically wedge-shaped ischemic pattern was not present.[] This patient ultimately underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement 6 days later. She was transferred to a rehabilitation facility on a steroid taper and subsequently discharged home on POD 40. She returned to the clinic 3 months after surgery fully recovered and ready for lead extension and pulse generator placement. Follow-up CT scans at the time showed significant resolution of the peri-lead edema and cystic cavitation [].","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 38-year-old female presented with acute onset of spontaneous CSF rhinorrhoea, which started a month ago. The patient disregarded the symptom and related it to rhinosinusitis. However, she again had episodes of intermittent nasal discharge on left side. She denied history of headache, vomiting, blurring, visual disturbance, or head injury. The ophthalmoscopic examination revealed papilledema [] with normal visual acuity and field charting. The laboratory analysis of nasal discharge tested positive for beta-2 transferrin. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cisternography was requested to demonstrate site of leakage. The patient was advised to get MRI on the day of active nasal discharge. The MRI was acquired in prone position with a dry cotton pledget placed in the left nasal opening. A tiny focus of CSF leakage was identified in the left cribriform plate [; zoomed up ], which was seen continuing posteroinferiorly into the nasal cavity []. The dry cotton pledget got soaked with CSF and appeared hyperintense on T2 weighted images []. In addition, MRI demonstrated perioptic CSF distension [], vertical tortuosity of the optic nerves [Figure and ], empty sella [], and very prominent CSF distended bilateral Meckel's cave []. No intracranial mass was noted. Moreover, MR venography showed bilateral distal transverse sinus stenosis []. Imaging diagnosis of IIH was suggested.
Lumbar puncture was performed 2 weeks later at the time of absence of CSF rhinorrhoea, which demonstrated increased opening pressure of 30 cm of H2O (normal 10–18 cm of H2O) with normal CSF composition on laboratory analysis. This confirmed imaging diagnosis of IIH. The patient was offered computerized tomography (CT) scan, which she denied. The patient was treated medically and was offered endoscopic surgical repair. Eventually, patient was lost to follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 63-year-old female presented with a chief complaint of right hip pain. She reported a fall six months previously, which resulted in a displaced femoral neck fracture and was treated surgically with a cemented hemiarthroplasty. She described no relief from this procedure and had pursued relief through other conservative treatments without success. On physical examination, the right leg was substantially shorter, with a distinguishable LLD present. Neurological testing revealed that the index surgery was complicated by a sciatic nerve injury and the patient had a foot drop on the operative side. This had developed into significant heterotopic ossification. Radiographic examination of the pelvis revealed a substantial LLD of 37 mm. Infectious workup on the right hip was negative.
Following consultation with the patient, the preoperative plan included a revision of the hemiarthroplasty and conversion to a right hip THA. During surgery, computer-assisted navigation was again used to assist with component placement and monitoring of changes in leg length. Surgery was successful and the patient did well post-operatively. She reported significant pain relief and was satisfied with the outcome of her surgery. Radiographs revealed equalized leg lengths and implants were well aligned. The patient was able to ambulate by three months post-procedure without any assistive devices. Her foot drop from the index surgery remained stable and improved slightly over the next year. A leg lengthening of 35 mm was confirmed on post-operative radiographs, resulting in a post-operative LLD of 2 mm. At one year the patient was back to her normal functional status prior to her hip fracture (Figure ).","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 27-year-old African American male with a history of morbid obesity status post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 9 years prior presented with painful nonbloody mucoid diarrhea, icterus, and dark urine of four-day duration. He described recent travel with family to a beach resort in the United States during which he noted that two family members had developed a self-limited diarrheal illness. Three days after exposure, he noted abdominal cramps followed by hourly watery yellow stools without blood. He also had intermittent nausea and an episode of bilious vomiting and reports not eating since onset of diarrheal illness. He noticed a 17-pound weight loss over 1 week. He had no fevers, chills, or rash. There was no preceding history of eating uncooked fish or meats and he had no tick exposure. Medication history included Lisinopril and Amlodipine, and he denied any new medications or alcohol use. He admitted to homosexual intercourse.
He was acutely ill-looking with icteric sclera and dry mucus membranes. Vitals signs showed low-grade fever of 100.2°F and pulse rate of 126 beats per minute. Cardiac, lung, and skin examinations were unremarkable. Abdomen was diffusely tender with hyperactive bowel sounds without peritoneal signs.
Laboratory data was remarkable for leukopenia of 2200/μL, hemoglobin of 12.7 g/dL, normal platelet of 158,000/μL, sodium of 128 meq/L and potassium of 3.2 meq/L, acute kidney injury with creatinine of 1.59 mg/dL (baseline of 0.63 mg/dL), BUN of 41 mg/dL, and anion gap of 19. After intravenous hydration, hemoglobin dropped to 10.1 g/dL and platelet to 96,000/μL. Sodium, BUN, and creatinine also improved with rehydration. He was also noted to have elevated transaminases AST 201 IU/L and ALT 73 IU/L, elevated total bilirubin of 8.2 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 4.4 mg/dL, normal alkaline phosphatase of 66 IU/L, albumin of 3.2 g/dL, normal lipase of 40 U/L, and elevated lactate of 3.5 meq/L. INR was elevated to 1.8; however, he had normal haptoglobin 236 mg/dL (36–195 mg/dL) and LDH 177 IU/L (normal: 94–202 IU/L). Hepatitis panel was negative. Patient also tested negative for HIV, CMV, EBV, and Parvovirus B19 infection. Tylenol level was normal. Urinalysis showed moderate bilirubinuria. Stool study was positive for Shigella sonnei but was otherwise negative for bacteria, ova, or parasites. Rickettsia rickettsii IgM was positive and he was treated with Doxycycline. Other workup for tick-borne infection including Lyme, Babesia, Ehrlichia, and Anaplasma was negative. Autoimmune workups including ANA, antismooth muscle, liver/kidney microsome, and mitochondrial antibodies were negative. Alpha-1 antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin were also normal.
Abdominal ultrasound showed a diffusely increased heterogeneous liver echogenicity with underlying hepatomegaly consistent with hepatic steatosis. Hepatoportal duplex showed patent portal vein and hepatic artery. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis was significant for hepatic steatosis, hepatomegaly, mild right colitis, and absence of gallstones. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) was unremarkable with normal intra- and extrahepatic biliary tree.
During his hospital course, bilirubin trended up to 9 mg/dL and INR peaked at 2.9. Patient was not encephalopathic. Given impending hepatic failure, recommendation was made to transfer the patient to a transplant center but he declined. He was treated with N-acetylcysteine. Blood culture initially reported as Gram-negative rods presumptively Escherichia coli (E. coli) was later confirmed to be Shigella sonnei. Urine culture remained negative. He was treated with ciprofloxacin based on sensitivity results with an improvement in diarrhea frequency and downward trend in transaminases. He remained stable and was discharged home on Day 8. He was doing well 4 months later with normal cell counts, normal liver, and kidney function.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"The patient was a 63-year-old man who met the DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. The onset of schizophrenia occurred in his early twenties. He had been treated with olanzapine (10 mg) for the last 4 years, but he had a tendency to stop the medication due to appetite and body weight. He was admitted to the hospital due to delusions and hallucinations at his older brother's funeral. Treatment with blonanserin (8 mg) and etizolam (1 mg, at night) was initiated for auditory hallucinations and delusions. At 2 weeks later, the patient complained of leg restlessness. His global score on the Barnes Akathisia Scale [] was 2. Substantial relief of akathisia was noted after 14 days of fluvoxamine (50 mg) treatment.

"Patient (3) is a 4 years old boy, the third in order of birth of first cousin marriage. He presented to the hepatology clinic with jaundice following an attack of vomiting and diarrhea. He had a similar attack at the age of two years that regressed spontaneously.
On examination the patient had progressive neurologic dysfunction, his height was 95 cm (-2 SD), weight was 13 kg (-3 SD) and skull circumference was 43 cm. He had characteristic physical appearance with enophthalmia, nystagmus, jaundice, and skin photosensitivity. His liver was 4 cm below the costal margin, firm in consistency with rounded border and smooth surface. The spleen was felt two cm below the costal margin. Neurological examination showed intention tremors, cerebellar ataxia, lost knee and preserved ankle deep reflexes. Chest and heart examination were clinically free.
Investigations at that time revealed ALT: 270 IU/L (N: 37), AST: 232 IU/L (N: 40) GGT: 183 (N: 50), total bilirubin: 3.35 mg/dl, direct bilirubin: 2.6 mg/dl, albumin: 3.2 g/dl, PT 11.7 sec. (INR: 1). Tests for HBV, HCV, and HAV revealed negative results. Ceruloplasmin level, protein electrophoresis and auto antibodies were also normal.
Abdominal ultrasonography revealed enlarged liver with regular border, homogenous echopatteren, patent portal and hepatic veins. Fundus examination showed no abnormality. CT brain was normal, while MRI brain showed deep white matter signal alteration at the forceps minor and major regions, middle cerebellar peduncles, the posterior segmental aspects of the pontine isthmus and basis pontis. Those areas exhibited bright signal on FLAIR and T2W1, a picture consistent with dysmyelinating disease.
The patient received ursodeoxycholic acid at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day and vitamin E (100 mg/day). Two months later, ALT decreased to 83 IU/L, AST decreased to 95 IU/L, total bilirubin was: 1.7 mg/dl, direct bilirubin: 0.7 mg/dl, albumin: 3.2 g/dl, and PT 11.3 seconds.

"A 30-year-old woman from Saudi-Arabia was admitted to our department of internal medicine with the strong suspicion of first manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia. Laboratory testing showed mild anemia and thrombocytopenia with normal leukocyte count. The differential blood cell count, however, showed 47% leukemic blasts. A bone marrow biopsy was performed immediately. With approximately 90% blasts the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was confirmed. Flow cytometry showed an expression of CD34, HLA-DR, CD38 and cyMPO. A cross-lineage of CD56 was found, which correlates with a poor prognosis []. Cytogenetics and molecular analysis of the bone marrow cells revealed an ETV6-gen deletion in 12p13. According to the hematologic protocol intensive induction chemotherapy with HAM (high-dose Ara-C and Mitoxantron) was immediately initiated.
On day 8 after admission (2 days after the first cycle of chemotherapy was finished) the patient developed neutropenic fever up to a temperature of 39.4°C. The first laboratory testing showed a decrease in leukocytes down to 0.4 G/l with a C-reactive protein (CRP) less than 0.1 mg/dl. Escherichia coli with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was isolated from initially taken blood cultures, whereas all other clinical and diagnostic examinations (x-ray of the chest, urine, echocardiography and ultrasonography) were normal. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics was immediately initiated with Piperacillin/Tazobactam and switched to Meropenem after microbiologic testing confirmed ESBL sepsis. On that first day of fever, the patient told us, that she fell in the bathroom hurting her right knee two days before (day 6 after admission). There was no apparent injury on her leg. On further clinical examination, besides fever, her vital signs were always normal. In the course of the next 2 days neutrophils dropped below 0.1 G/l and CRP levels soared to a peak of 29.9 mg/dl. Highest procalcitonin level (PCT) measured was 1.7 ng/ml. Three days after the patient suffered from the minor injury to her lateral thigh, she suddenly presented a small hematoma with only little pain (day 9 after admission). There were no signs of superinfection of the hematoma explaining the clinical and laboratory signs of this unclear systemic infection. On that day, the patient was first presented to the surgical department. Within the next two days, the hematoma rapidly changed to a big untypical necrosis of the skin (day 11 after admission, see Figure ). Therefore, the patient was again presented to the surgical department. The patient was still in a good general condition with only little pain. A CT scan was initiated and showed entrapped air under the site of necrosis. Although the skin manifestation was not typical for a necrotizing soft tissue lesion, we considered the possibility of an untypical case of NF during severe neutropenia. Therefore, a surgical exploration was performed immediately (see Figure ). Macroscopically, subcutaneous tissue, fascia and muscle showed the typical characteristics of necrotizing fasciitis with grey necrotic tissue, facial edema, vessel thrombosis and non-contacting muscle. Intraoperative, there was only minimal resistance dissecting the subcutaneous fascia off the deep fascia, which is commonly described as positive “finger test” []. The histological findings showed facial necrosis, vasculitis, thrombosis and suppuration of the veins and arteries coursing through the fascia. But, there were no signs of disease-causing bacteria or infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the deep dermis and fascia as expected. First microbiological testing did not find any bacteria. The initial histopathological report could not confirm the typical picture of necrotizing fasciitis (see Figure ). In the further course of time, intensive care medicine was needed. After confirmation of adequate morphologic blast clearance in the bone marrow supportive treatment with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was added on day 18 (after start of chemotherapy). Neutrophils eventually recovered on day 23 (>500/μl). After beginning to recover, histopathological analyses of additional specimen of surgical resections showed the expected typical pathological findings like inflammatory cells and bacteria. Furthermore, microbiological testing confirmed ESBL infection. A multiplicity of operations with extended debridement was performed in order to eradicate the infection using negative pressure wound therapy. After successful eradication the skin defect involved the complete lateral thigh including nearly the whole circumference of the lower leg. In the further course of time, the immense skin defects had to be prepared for further reconstructive surgery. Reconstructive surgery with mesh graft harvest was complicated by the limited residual skin available on the lower extremity and the delay on wound healing of the harvest sites. Due to unfavorable cytogenetics and the complicated course of treatment our patient was assigned to undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation in first remission. But, the transplantation was only possible with wounds totally closed. It took another six surgical interventions and nearly eight months to finally close all wounds (see Figure ). After further recovery the patient underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation as planned. Today, she is doing well and there is no evidence of disease.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"RF is a 66-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient had a HeartMate II LVAD placed 3 years prior to presentation for medically refractory heart failure. He was on warfarin and aspirin for his LVAD with goal INR of 1.5–2.0. He presented to the emergency department with light-headedness and hematochezia for several days. He had no prior history of GIB. His physical examination and vital signs were unremarkable. His INR was 2.8, creatinine was 2.3 mg/dl, and hemoglobin was 10.4 from baseline of 12 to 13 g/dl. His last screening colonoscopy was 4 years prior and was reportedly unremarkable. He was admitted for close monitoring, serial laboratory testing, and gastroenterology consultation. He underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealing a gastric ulcer with a clean base with no evidence of active bleeding. A colonoscopy revealed a likely malignant tumor in the cecum, diverticulosis, and nonbleeding colonic angiodysplastic lesions []. The cecal mass was biopsied; it appeared to be actively bleeding and uncontrollable endoscopically. These findings were relayed to the emergency general surgery team.
He was taken emergently to the operating room. A midline laparotomy was undertaken and he was found to have a cecal mass that was perforated into a retroperitoneal abscess. The right colon was mobilized to the hepatic flexure and the abscess cavity was debrided. A right colectomy was performed with a stapled side-to-side ileocolonic anastomosis. A drain was placed in the abscess cavity, fascia was closed, and the skin and subcutaneous tissues were packed with gauze.
Final pathology showed no evidence of malignancy. It revealed a transmural defect of 1.0 cm × 0.5 cm with organizing hematoma and acute on chronic inflammation. Cytomegalovirus testing was negative. There was focal re-epithelialization, thus making bleeding diverticulum a possible diagnosis.
The patient's postoperative course was complicated by prolonged ileus necessitating total parenteral nutrition and pelvic abscess that required percutaneous drain placement. The patient additionally had bacteremia and fungemia. The patient's postoperative complications eventually resolved, and he was discharged to home with home health.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

Lung auscultation revealed a mild decrease in the intensity of breath sounds, whereas heart examination was completely normal, without extra sounds or murmurs. The electrocardiogram (ECG) was lacking remarkable findings. The patient had negative reaction of the Mantoux tuberculin skin test. Moreover, all routine laboratory test results, including liver and kidney function tests, serum proteins and urinanalysis were normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was normal (ESR 12 mm/hr). Sputum specimens for mycobacteria and other pathogens were smear and culture negative. Serological tests for cancer or virus were negative but serology for echinococcosis showed an indirect immunohemagglutination test positive. Other autoimmune markers were negative. Chest x-ray depicted multiple calcified cystic formations (Figure ). A Multi-Detector Computed Tomography (MDCT) of the chest [] and abdomen identified localized bronchiectatic lesions of the right upper lobe, calcified spots at both the lung fields, probably from previous disease (chickenpox, tuberculosis or occupational disease), a low density solitary lesion with peripheral calcification located at the myocardium of LV (compatible with calcified echinococcus cyst) (Figure ) and other three similar but smaller findings were located at the liver. The CT scan of the brain showed no disease. No lung disease was diagnosed with the bronchoscopy. Transthoracic contrast echocardiography revealed a cyst-like echoluscent structure 5 × 2 cm, occupying the Posterior Wall of Left Ventricle (PWLV). It gave the impression of endomyocardial localization due to the decreased thickness of the PWLV (Figure ). The rest of examination was normal with an estimated ejection fraction of 60%, without regional wall motion abnormalities. Coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries.
Excision of the cardiac cyst was planned by using cardiopulmonary bypass and the patient received perioperative chemotherapy with albendazol 10 mg/kg. After a median sternotomy the patient was connected to the cardiopulmonary bypass by cannulating the ascending aorta and right atrium. The pericardial cavity was free of adhesions. Under condition of normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass the aorta was crossclamped and the heart was arrested with a dose of antegrade cold blood-based cardioplegia. The heart was lifted and the free surface of the cyst was seen as a white tense mass in the lateral wall of left ventricle (Figure ). By palpation, it was partially calcified. The lateral wall of the left ventricle was localized by gauzes irrigated by 10% NaCl solution. A small incision was made into the cyst corresponding its free wall, and a viscous sub-yellow fluid was aspirated. The sub-epicardial wall of the cyst was then excised and its contents were completely aspirated (Figure ). The cyst was then injected, first with 10 ml of 10% NaCl solution and then with 5 ml of povidone iodine solution, which was left inside for 3 min and then aspirated. The resultant cavity was then obliterated by a continuous 4-0 prolene suture (Figure ). To complete this obliteration, we avoided to use any prosthetic material such as pledgets, to prevent possible postoperative infection. After de-clamping of the aorta and de-airing of the heart, the patient was easily weaned off bypass with no inotropic support. Cytology of the aspirated cyst fluid and histology of the cyst wall was consistent with the diagnosis of hydatid cyst (Figure ). The patient had an uneventful recovery and at the fifth postoperative day she discharged from the hospital with a normal echocardiographic examination which confirmed preserved function of the mitral valve apparatus, with only minimal regurgitation.
Follow up at 6 and 12 months, with echocardiography (Figure ) and CT scan, which confirmed the excellent post-surgery result without complications or recurrence of the disease. The findings of the liver were stable and brain CT was clear.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 52-year-old woman presented with a nine month history of generalized lymphadenopathy, skin lesions (multiple crusts all over her body), low fever, weight loss of more than 30 kg, vomiting, abdominal distension, mild dyspnea and a left breast mass (measuring 50 x 10 mm). She denied having any allergies or previous relevant diseases.
She was hospitalized for further investigation. Laboratory testing findings showed negative serology for HIV and viral hepatitis, anemia (hemoglobin 11.0 g/dL), and low serum albumin (2.3 g/dL), mild (prerenal) acute kidney injury, and elevated C-reactive protein (over 8 times the maximum reference value).
Chest radiography was performed and showed mild/moderate bilateral pleural effusions. In addition, the patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) of the neck, chest and abdomen. CT revealed the presence of a breast mass, generalized necrotic lymph node enlargement (cervical, axillary, mediastinal, abdominal and inguinal), mild splenomegaly, pleural effusion and ascites ().
She underwent a thoracocentesis that disclosed the presence of a milky fluid whose analysis showed a triglyceride concentration > 600 mg/dL, with no neoplastic cells. Additionally, paracentesis was performed, and the finding was consistent with chylous ascites, and neoplastic cells were not found.
Biopsies of the breast mass (core biopsy), skin lesions and enlarged inguinal lymph nodes were performed and stained using the Grocott-Gomori methenamine-silver (GGMS) technique, the gold standard to diagnose paracoccidioidomycosis according to guidelines. All of the biopsies revealed the presence of large round yeast cells with multiple narrow-based budding daughter cells, characteristic of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis.
Thereafter, liposomal amphotericin B was prescribed, as well as a high protein and low fat diet (supplemented with medium chain triglycerides). Despite the treatment, her clinical status worsened, with development of severe acute kidney injury that required renal replacement therapy, pneumonia, septic shock, and she subsequently died.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 70-year-old female patient without a history of smoking presented with a subcutaneous tumor in the left thigh. Positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) scans revealed a 4.0 × 4.2-cm mass in the upper left lung lobe and multiple muscular and bone metastatic lesions (Figure ). She was diagnosed with stage IVB cancer (T2bN0M1c). Her performance status was 1 and serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was 18.6 (normal range, 0–5.0) ng/ml.
Pathological examination of the resected subcutaneous tumor in the left thigh revealed moderately differentiated SCC with cornification (Figure ). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed diffuse and strongly positive staining for pan-cytokeratin, cytokeratin 5/6, and p40, although the cells were negative for thyroid transcription factor-1, CK7, napsin A, and CD56 (Figure ). The tumor expressed wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) based on the molecular analysis of exons 18–21 and was diffusely and strongly positive (3+) for ALK by intercalated antibody-enhanced immunohistochemistry with an ALK detection kit (Nichirei Bioscience; Figure ). Based on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using break-apart probes for ALK (Figure ), the patient was diagnosed with SCC harboring EML4-ALK rearrangement and treated with alectinib (300 mg twice daily). Two months later, PET-CT images revealed dramatic shrinkage in the size of primary tumor in the left upper lung lobe and reduction in the size of multiple muscular, bone, and skin metastases (Figure ); therefore, the patient was considered to have achieved partial response to alectinib according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors guidelines (version 1.1). Although she experienced recurrence after a durable response of 9.5 months, there were no severe alectinib-related adverse events.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 46-year-old male with a history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis complicated by small esophageal varices after banding and moderate ascites was awaiting liver transplant (MELD 24, Child-Pugh class B). He presented with a 3-day history of abdominal pain. He described the pain as sharp and located around the periumbilical area with notable suprapubic discomfort. He also reported associated symptoms of nausea, hematochezia, and general malaise. On further review of systems, he reported chills, increased fatigue, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and decreased appetite 4 days prior to presentation. He reported compliance at home with a sodium-restricted diet and medications. Physical exam was significant for abdominal distension with positive fluid wave, generalized abdominal tenderness, and splenomegaly. Scant blood was noted on the rectal exam. Laboratory studies revealed stable hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL, hematocrit of 36.8%, platelet of 83 K/UL, leukocytosis of 15.4 K/UL with 78% neutrophils and 16% bands, sodium of 130 mmol/L, ammonia of 83 Umol/L, ALT of 40 U/L, AST of 42 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase of 127 U/L. International normalized ratio (INR) was 2.02. Diagnostic paracentesis revealed serosanguinous fluid and ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) count of 686 cells/mm3, consistent with culture negative neutrocytic ascites. Blood cultures revealed no growth of organisms. The patient was started on intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone, IV pantoprazole infusion, and an IV bolus of octreotide followed by continuous infusion. He completed a 5-day course of IV ceftriaxone therapy.
The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which showed ulcerations in the distal esophagus from prior banding of small esophageal varices and diffuse portal hypertensive gastropathy (). Mucosal edema and erythema with an area of oozing of blood were identified in the duodenum bulb and between proximally located duodenal folds with no specific identifiable lesion. These findings correlated with a diagnosis of portal hypertensive duodenopathy (). Colonoscopy was performed, and it showed no active bleeding. However, there were old blood clots in the terminal ileum in addition to mild inflammation in the terminal ileum near the ileocecal valve. Video capsule endoscopy was also performed, and it revealed no active bleeding. Because of the concern of the possible failure of the patient on medical therapy for portal hypertension while awaiting liver transplant, the patient was referred for evaluation by a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). The patient successfully underwent the TIPS procedure. Follow-up occurred one month later in clinic. At this time, the patient reported resolution of the hematochezia.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"Seventeen year old boy with mass lesion in the right neck and weight loss attended to the hospital. He had a family history of malignancy in his sister. He had bilateral exophtalmos, cervical lymphadenopathy approximately 3 cm in diameter, icterus and ulcers in the scalp in physical examination.
Computed Tomography
The computed tomography images were obtained by a 64 channel multidetector CT device (Aquilion 64, Toshiba Medical Systems, Japan) with intravenous contrast medium administration and with slice thickness of 0.5 mm. The images were reconstructed in axial, coronal and sagittal planes and interpreted in soft tissue and bone windows.
Computed tomography examination revealed multiple cervical, anterior mediastinal conglomerated lymph nodes and bilateral pulmonary nodules. Additionally lytic lesions in the corpus of T7, T10 and destruction of T2 vertebra by a soft tissue mass were reported in the diagnostic CT ().
Bone Scintigraphy
The bone scintigraphy was performed by a double head single photon emission tomography (SPECT) gamma camera (GE, Infinia II, Israel) equipped with low energy high resolution parallel hole collimator. After intravenous administration of 20 mCi (740 MBq) (according to the body weight) Tc-99m methylene diphosphonate (MDP) and waiting period of 2-3 hours, routine whole body, and additional spot images were obtained. Asymmetrical increased tracer accumulation in unexpected sites without history of previous trauma or surgery was accepted as disease extent.
Bone scintigraphy showed multiple increased activity in predominantly cranium, bilateral ribs and pelvic region () however, there was no sign of vertebral involvement; neither decreased nor increased activity accumulation.
PET/CT Imaging
The patient fasted for 12 hours before PET/CT examination and his blood glucose concentration was 124 mg/dL. Imaging was performed by a PET/CT scanner (Siemens Biograph, 6 slice spiral CT integrated PET/CT, Siemens Medical System) after injection of 10 mCi (370 MBq) 18F-FDG and 60 minutes waiting interval. CT was performed from head to thigh with a slice thickness of 5.0 mm. For semi-quantitative assessment, regions of interests (ROIs) were produced. The maximum SUV (SUVmax) value was measured from ROI according to the standard formula. PET and CT datasets and fusion images were interpreted by an experienced nuclear medicine physician.
In the PET/CT images there were multiple hypermetabolic areas bilaterally in cervical region, mediastinal, abdominal and pelvic lymph nodes, anterior mediastinal mass () and in all the bone lesions identified in bone scintigraphy and CT , ). Additionally orbital involvement of the LCH is observed as increased FDG accumulation in the left orbita and the soft tissue component in CT (). Excisional biopsy of cervical lymph node revealed Langerhans cell histiocytosis. In the biopsy specimen there were atypical histiocytes infiltrating the whole lymph node, giant cells and microabcesses were present. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positivity of CD3, CD8, CD5, CD20, CD15, CD68, S-100, Vimentin, LCA and CD1a and negativity of CD10, Pan CK, EMA, Fascin, CD38 and CD138.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 96-year-old female body was received through the Saint Louis University Gift of Body Program of the Center for Anatomical Science and Education (CASE) with the signed informed consent from the donor. The CASE gift body program abides by all rules set forth by the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA). Information obtained through the CASE program did not specify a cause of death but did mention a history of Alzheimer's disease, COPD, and atrial fibrillation in this donor. During dissection in 2018, it was observed that the donor was status post hysterectomy and status post ventral hernia repair with mesh.
During routine dissection, a markedly dilated left ureter was noticed and further explored (). The left renal pelvis was located outside of the kidney sitting medially, inferiorly, and slightly posteriorly from the kidney. The path of the ureter curved slightly posteriorly and medially before turning laterally. The ureter then turned sharply medially and anteriorly before continuing over the psoas major muscle. The ureter was most dilated as it passed anteriorly to the left psoas minor muscle, where its diameter measured at 1.70 cm. The ureter then passed posterior to the EIA and anterior to the IIA, about 0.50 cm away from the bifurcation of the AA.
Upon further dissection, it was found that what was initially identified as the left CIA was in fact the left EIA. The donor had three terminal arterial branches off the AA: the right CIA, left IIA, and left EIA. The left IIA branched off the posterior side of the AA. As a result, the median sacral artery was shifted and was observed branching off the right CIA (). After passing beneath the left EIA, the left ureter returned to a normal size (0.45 cm) and position following a normal path to the bladder ().
The three major calyces of the left kidney were found to join together outside of the kidney (). All arteries and veins of the left kidney were normal, and no evidence of hydronephrosis was observed (). Constriction of the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) was noted, though this slight constriction did not result in any gross renal pathology ().
Finally, the subject exhibited extensive surgical sutures, likely from the hysterectomy, along the lateral paravertebral muscles as well as near the left IIA, inferolateral to the ureter.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 50-year-old lady, who had a history of hypertension, presented with severe headache and ataxia. CT scan done at admission showed acute right cerebellar hematoma []. DSA done subsequently revealed fusiform aneurysm of the cisternal segment of the SCA []. Endovascular treatment was done under general anesthesia with inside out coiling of the aneurysm with platinum coils []. Standard heparin protocol was followed and an activated clotting time greater than 250 s was maintained during the procedure. 5F Envoy (cordis) guiding catheter was placed in the distal vertebral artery. A combination of echelon-10 micro-catheter (ev3) and transcend 0.014 micro-wire (Stryker) were used to access the aneurysms and multiple axiom (ev3) coils were used to occlude the aneurysm. Post-coiling angiogram showed complete exclusion of the aneurysm from the circulation. The post-operative period was uneventful. The patient's neurological examination done after 1 month was completely normal.

"A 24-year-old man riding a motorcycle collided with a car while turning to the right. He fell off the motorcycle after the collision, and was injured by another car. He had no previous medical history. When he was brought to our emergency department in an ambulance, his airway was patent, he was tachypneic, hypotensive, tachycardic, and his Glasgow coma scale score was 7 (E1V2M4). Intubation, bilateral chest drainage, and blood transfusion were performed. Following assessment by whole-body computed tomography (CT), he was diagnosed with bilateral pneumothorax, liver and spleen injuries, fractures of the left acetabulum, right patella and tibial plateau, with open fractures of the shaft of the right femur and distal third of the left femur (Fig. ). External fixation and irrigation of both thighs were performed in the operating room. The liver and spleen injuries were treated conservatively. After surgery, his consciousness disorder persisted. Initially, hypoxia was not accompanied by significant changes in chest radiographs; however, serial chest radiographs showed progressive bilateral pulmonary opacities consistent with ARDS (Fig. A and B). Contrast-enhanced CT also showed bilateral patchy gland glass opacity and consolidation matching chest radiographs, and there was no filling defect in pulmonary artery. Arterial blood gases on the 4th day of admission showed a PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio of 100 mmHg under 10 cm H2O of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). In addition, the patient developed subconjunctival, abdominal, and precordial petechiae (Fig. ). He remained tachycardic, febrile with a body temperature >38°C, and was jaundiced. Laboratory data showed exacerbation of anemia (hemoglobin, 9.1 × 10 g/L), decreased platelet count (88 × 109 /L), and elevated total bilirubin levels (8.9 × 10 μmol/ L). Gurd and Wilson criteria (3 major and 5 minor criteria) and Schonfeld scoring system were used for the diagnosis of FES. The criteria of both scoring systems were met, thereby supporting the positive diagnosis of FES (Table ).[
The patient had type 1 respiratory failure which gradually worsened with conventional lung-protective ventilation. Due to a persistent consciousness disorder, prophylactic antiepileptic drug administration, anticerebral edema therapy, and targeted temperature management using an intravascular temperature control catheter were performed.[ On the 6th day of admission, the Murray score was 3.5 indicating severe lung injury: P/F ratio of 81 mmHg (4 points), pulmonary edema in all lung fields on chest X-ray (4 points), PEEP of 14 cm H2O (3 points), compliance of 23.3 ml/cm H2O (3 points). Because his cardiac function was not reduced and hemodynamic status was maintained, we chose VV-ECMO over venoarterial-ECMO.[ A 23 French multi-stage drainage cannula was inserted from the left femoral vein to the inferior vena cava, and a 17 French single-stage return cannula was cannulated from the right internal jugular vein to the superior vena cava. The ECMO rotation speed was 3300 r/minute and the flow rate was 4.5 L/minute with 100%FiO2 and 4.5 L/minute sweep gas flow. Under the condition, his peripheral oxygen saturation was maintained >95% and blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.42, PO2 of 95 mmHg, and PCO2 of 46.6 mmHg. Although lung protection management was continued with high PEEP and low tidal volume after VV-ECMO introduction, improvement in respiratory condition was not observed. Therefore, we decided to convert the external fixation to internal fixation to begin prone position therapy. Osteosynthesis was performed on the 9th day of admission under VV-ECMO. In the supine position a tourniquet was applied on the left side. The lateral parapatellar approach was used to reduce the fracture and fix the screws and lateral locking plate (Fig. A). The tourniquet was released to place the screws in the proximal holes of the plate, following which there was continued congestive bleeding. Heparin had been introduced into the circuit at the beginning of the operation, but due to a large amount of blood loss, protamine sulfate, an antagonist for heparin, was administered midoperation. The bleeding was controlled by closing the left knee wound and inserting a drain. Osteosynthesis of the right femur was then performed using a retrograde intramedullary nail (Fig. B) without any serious complications. The total operation time was 4 hours and 29 minutes and the total blood loss amounted to 3800 g. Sixteen units of red blood cell transfusion, 20 units of platelet transfusion, and 16 units of fresh frozen plasma were needed. The ECMO circuit was run heparin free for 2 days postsurgery.
Prone-position ventilation was initiated on the second day postsurgery after the hemodynamics became stable. The patient was placed in the prone position for 16 hours a day. Low tidal volume ventilation (6 ml/kg) and an infusion of neuromuscular blockade was introduced. To address severe acute kidney injury due to hemolysis, we also started continuous renal replacement therapy on the 14th day. For 4 days, the patient was managed in the prone position. His respiratory condition and chest radiographs improved steadily over the 8 days following osteosynthesis, and VV-ECMO was discontinued on the 17th day (Fig. C). The ventilator was removed on the 28th day. At that time, his respiratory status improved to P/F ratio: 370, and multiple petechiae disappeared. His conscious level normalized without residual central nervous system complications.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 63-year-old man presented to the emergency department with epigastric pain, malaise, and hematochezia for one day. Except for a history of aortic valve replacement three years ago, there was no other remarkable pertinent finding in his medical history. The patient was afebrile, conscious and haemodynamically stable at triage. After a non-enhanced abdominal CT which demonstrated left renal infarction and suspected acute pancreatitis, the patient was admitted to gastroenterology ward with the diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, left renal infarction and possible acute pancreatitis. Upon his arrival on the ward, he suddenly became hypotensive and collapsed, and was found to have profuse sweating. After fluid resuscitation, the patients regained consciousness soon. Emergency contrast-enhanced abdominal CT revealed splenic artery aneurysm rupture and intraabdominal bleeding, left renal and splenic infarction (). Unfortunately, he developed massive bleeding from upper gastrointestinal tract and subsequently cardiopulmonary arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was unsuccessful and the patient expired.

"A 54-year-old right-handed woman presented 12-year history of progressive memory decline. She was a university educated woman. At the age of 42 years, her main symptoms were that she forgot names and needed to make notes. She had poorer recall of information than the others at her school of hotel management. In contrast, she was independent in all activities of daily living but her mood was depressed. At initial consultation, when she was 45 years old, general neurological exam was unremarkable. Attention, language and visuospatial function and frontal executive function were normal. Apraxia, dyscalculia and Gerstmann syndrome were not shown. However, Hopkin’s verbal learning test showed that free-recall score was 21 (5-8-8) and 20 min delayed-recall was 2. Its recognition score presented that true positive was 8 and false positive was 3. Delayed recall of Rey figure score was 5.5. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was 27/30, time orientation 4/5 and three word recall 2/3. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan are shown in Fig. . The upper axial and coronal FLAIR images showed that medial temporal lobe atrophy was not prominent but bilateral parietal atrophy was on. Her APOE genotype was homozygous for ε3. Her mother had dementia at the age of 40s and died before 60s. No specific diagnosis was made in her mother. Her father and only brother did not show dementia. She has two daughters, 29 and 26 years old. The initial clinical impression was mild cognitive impairment with depression. However, AD could not be ruled out. She showed progressive deterioration in verbal and visual memory. At the age of 53, her MMSE was 2/30 and clinical dementia rate (CDR) was 3. She was able to respond only to her name and distinguish her daughter from unfamiliar people. She needed personal care. Her brain MRI (Fig. , lower) demonstrated that global cortical atrophy, more prominent in medial temporal and parietal lobes. FDG-PET (fludeoxyglucose- positron emission tomography) of the patient reveals the bilateral temporal, parietal, precuneal and frontal hypometabolism (Fig. ).

"A 46-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension presented to our trauma bay with complex injuries of the right nose and midface, which included an amputated nose, upper lip and right eyebrow approximately 40 minutes after an assault including numerous human bite wounds. His right ala, right sidewall, and right upper lip were entirely missing, with nasal airways on each side visible. The amputated specimens included nasal tissue which measured approximately 4.0 x 4.0 cm, the eyebrow 2.0 x 2.0 cm, and the upper lip 1.0 x 11.7 cm (Figure ). After rapid sequence intubation, assessment, and stabilization, the patient was taken to the operating room about one hour after the initial presentation for reattachment and wound reconstruction.
In the OR, the superior labial artery and a small outflow vein, which was likely part of the superior labial venous plexus, were identified and isolated from the lateral portion of the lip. However, the nasal segment contained no identifiable viable artery or vein. Therefore, the nasal and eyebrow portions were replanted similarly to full thickness skin grafts and the upper lip was replanted using microvascular techniques. The segments of each vessel were flushed with heparinized saline. Then, the superior labial artery was anastomosed using 9-0 nylon interrupted sutures, followed by anastomosis of the vein using 9-0 nylon. After three hours and 19 minutes of operating time, arterial blood flow was immediately apparent, but venous flow was not definitive. The wounds of the upper eyelid and right cheek were debrided and then closed.
To improve the chance of tissue survival, our patient was scheduled to receive hyperbaric oxygen treatment within 24 hours post-operation. However, the patient reported that his ears could not tolerate the pressure and therapy was postponed until otolaryngology could insert tubes at the bedside. Additionally, he was receiving 30 mg of enoxaparin daily to mitigate the chance of outflow venous thrombosis. The replaced nasal and eyebrow tissue and the microsurgically replanted upper lip appeared to have some minor ischemia at the lateral margins (particularly of the nasal tip) that would most likely require revision, but the majority of the three portions appeared healthy (Figure ).
Later that day, the patient reported upper extremity numbness. After a non-contrast CT showed no intracranial abnormality, he received 8.34 mg bolus of tPA followed by 75.1 mg of IV tPA over the course of an hour for possible ischemic stroke. Subsequent MRI showed a small acute left frontal cortical infarction. The next morning the patient reported chest discomfort and an EKG showed ST-segment elevation of inferior leads with elevated troponin peak of 132.2 due to myocardial infarction. The patient then underwent left heart catheterization that showed adequate flow and no need for further intervention. After these events, he received 30 mg of enoxaparin twice a day per protocol.
After tPA treatment, there was marked continuous sanguineous discharge from the replant sites and the eyebrow, nose, and upper lip began to appear increasingly dusky. Our patient was determined to be a high-risk candidate for immediate revision surgery and plans for secondary reconstruction were made. The patient returned six days later for facial wound debridement of necrotic wounds of the upper lip, nose, and right forehead with subsequent placement of Integra artificial dermis (Figure ). He subsequently underwent nose and upper lip advancement flaps to save oral competence. A month later, nasal reconstruction was undertaken with a left paramedian forehead flap and full-thickness skin graft to upper lip and nose. The second stage of reconstruction was done one month later including the second stage of the paramedian flap, ear cartilage graft to the nose, and full-thickness skin graft of the upper lip (Figure ). Subsequent reconstruction one month later included an Abbe flap from the lower lip to the upper lip and final revision of the forehead flap. Overall, our patient was satisfied with the cosmetic and functional outcome of his reconstruction four months after his final surgery (Figure ).","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

In contrast, she was independent in all activities of daily living but her mood was depressed. At initial consultation, when she was 45 years old, general neurological exam was unremarkable. Attention, language and visuospatial function and frontal executive function were normal. Apraxia, dyscalculia and Gerstmann syndrome were not shown. However, Hopkin’s verbal learning test showed that free-recall score was 21 (5-8-8) and 20 min delayed-recall was 2. Its recognition score presented that true positive was 8 and false positive was 3. Delayed recall of Rey figure score was 5.5. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was 27/30, time orientation 4/5 and three word recall 2/3. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan are shown in Fig. . The upper axial and coronal FLAIR images showed that medial temporal lobe atrophy was not prominent but bilateral parietal atrophy was on. Her APOE genotype was homozygous for ε3. Her mother had dementia at the age of 40s and died before 60s. No specific diagnosis was made in her mother. Her father and only brother did not show dementia. She has two daughters, 29 and 26 years old. The initial clinical impression was mild cognitive impairment with depression. However, AD could not be ruled out. She showed progressive deterioration in verbal and visual memory. At the age of 53, her MMSE was 2/30 and clinical dementia rate (CDR) was 3. She was able to respond only to her name and distinguish her daughter from unfamiliar people. She needed personal care. Her brain MRI (Fig. , lower) demonstrated that global cortical atrophy, more prominent in medial temporal and parietal lobes. FDG-PET (fludeoxyglucose- positron emission tomography) of the patient reveals the bilateral temporal, parietal, precuneal and frontal hypometabolism (Fig. ). They consent to perform genetic sequencing on her and her 2 daughters. We screened the APP, PSEN1, PSEN2 and PRNP (prion protein) gene.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 44-year-old male presented with a 3-month history of atypical chest pain, palpitation, and exertional dyspnea. Cardiac auscultation revealed a Grade III/IV to-and-fro murmur. Electrocardiography showed normal sinus rhythm.
Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed an aneurysm of the noncoronary cusp of sinus of Valsalva rupturing into the RA. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and three-dimensional (3D) images were taken before the procedure. In the midesophageal right ventricle (RV) inflow view, they clearly showed ruptured sinus of Valsalva [RSOV] into RA.
The procedure was performed under general anesthesia with TEE guidance. Seldinger technique was used to achieve percutaneous access to the right femoral artery (RFA) and vein so that two hemostatic sheaths were inserted. Intravenous heparin (200 IU/kg) and cefazolin were given.
From RFA approach, right and left heart pressures and saturations were obtained, and aortic root angiography was performed. The RSOV was measured at its aortic end as well as at the rupture site on TEE. RSOV was tried crossing with terumo wire under real time-TEE guidance. However, we were not able to pass through RSOV. Hence, we took use of 3D imaging available in our TEE machine and tried passing terumo wire across RSOV and position in SVC under the guidance of midesophageal aortic valve long axis at 120° and other real time-3D video images and Aortography, and we succeeded in passing the guide wire across RSOV. It was then snared from venous end, and an arteriovenous loop was established. The defect was measured 5.5 mm at its aortic end as measured by TEE and 8 mm when measured in 3D images. According to the measurement in the 3DTEE and aortogram, a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) occluder 2–4 mm larger than the narrowest diameter of the ruptured site was chosen to close most of the lesions. An 8F PDA delivery sheath then placed in the descending aorta and 10 mm × 8 mm RSOV PDA occluder device (life tech) was placed in the sac of RSOV noncoronary cusp after checking for aortic regurgitation (AR). The entire assembly was pulled back until the disk blocked the aortic end of the ruptured site without slipping into the aneurysm.
TEE images and aortogram after releasing of the device showed minimal residual shunt across RSOV and no AR. Subsequent echocardiography (echo) next day showed no residual flow [ and Video –].","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 52-year-old female presented with a sudden onset of right-sided numbness and weakness that was accompanied by a left temporal cluster-like headache. No fever or prodromal infection was found at disease onset.
The family and personal history was unremarkable.
On physical examination, the height and weight of the patient were 154 cm and 56 kg, respectively. Vital signs were normal, as were heart, lung and abdominal exami-nations. Neurological examination showed intact mental status, with normal speech and comprehension. Mild 4/5 right-sided hemiparesis was present with normal tone in both the arm and leg, though no other focal neurological deficits were found. After admission, she complained of discomfort and tingling in the right leg, after which a generalized tonic-clonic seizure for 3 min occurred before it was stopped by a bolus of intravenous diazepam.
Laboratory tests, including D-dimer, lactic acid, and serum autoantibody levels, as well as thyroid function and tumor markers indicated no apparent abnormalities. Glucose tolerance and lactic acid movement tolerance tests were normal. A lumbar puncture was performed, and her open intracranial pressure was 180 mm H2O. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing showed that cell counts and protein, glucose, chloride, monoclonal antibody, adenosine deaminase, and lactate dehydrogenas levels were within normal ranges.
MRI demonstrated a lamellar left parietal lobe lesion predominantly involving the cortex, with hyperintensity on both diffusion-weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (Figure ). The apparent diffusion coefficient map revealed a preserved, isointense signal. No abnormalities were found by susceptibility weighted imaging or magnetic resonance angiography and venography (Figure ). Due to the stroke-like onset pattern and MRI features, further thrombophilia screening was performed and showed decreased protein S activity. A diagnosis of cortical venous thrombosis was first proposed. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) was also considered but temporarily excluded because of the incomplete manifestation and lack of genetic evidence. Anticoagulation therapy was initiated, and follow-up was performed to maintain the international normalized ratio (INR) within the target range.
Two months later, the patient was readmitted for subacute cognitive impairment. She was unable to identify and communicate with family members; she also had difficulty understanding questions or instructions and instead responded by repeating the word ""nothing"". During hospitalization, a secondary generalized seizure occurred, initially with eyes gazing to the right and then convulsion developing, which lasted for approximately 10 s before self-alleviation. Neurological examination suggested transcortical sensory aphasia, with fully covered limb strength. Blood tests and CSF examination were normal; INR was 2.21. On repeated MRI, new lesions were identified in the left temporal lobe and were also detected 10 days later in the right temporal lobe on radiological follow-up (Figures and ). Although the MRI signal characteristics are consistent with the initial findings, the original lesion in the left parietal lobe had been alleviated, with cortical atrophy. We further conducted magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), which revealed markedly elevated lactate (Lac) concentrations in the regions of interest in the left temporal lesion (Figure ). Mitochondrial encephalopathy was diagnosed, and genetic testing using peripheral blood was performed. However, DNA testing for frequent MELAS and myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers syndrome mutations were negative. Because of the lack of symptoms of muscle weakness or pain, the patient declined our suggestion of performing a muscle biopsy. Anticoagulation therapy was terminated, and levetiracetam (1000 mg/d) was administered.
At 3 mo after her second admission, the patient was experiencing involuntary movement in her left limbs, with repetitive flexion/extension. An MRI scan showed a hyperintense signal abnormality in the right parietal lobe (Figure ). Brachial biceps biopsy was performed. Histopathology revealed no abnormalities, and no necrotic or regenerating fibers were observed; ragged-red fibers and intense succinate dehydrogenase activity were not detected. Nonetheless, complete sequencing of mitochondrial DNA samples extracted from the biopsied muscle revealed a heteroplasmic m.10158T>C mutation, with a heteroplasmy level of 69.6%, in the mitochondrial complex I subunit gene MT-ND3. In contrast, this mutation was not found in her peripheral blood cells.
The diagnosis was MELAS syndrome harboring the m.10158T>C mutation.
We administered levetiracetam (1000 mg/d) and oxcarbazepine (400 mg/d) to control epilepsy. Q10 and L-arginine were also administered.
Over the next 6 mo, the present patient did not manifest any further stroke-like episodes.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 46-year-old male with a history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis complicated by small esophageal varices after banding and moderate ascites was awaiting liver transplant (MELD 24, Child-Pugh class B). He presented with a 3-day history of abdominal pain. He described the pain as sharp and located around the periumbilical area with notable suprapubic discomfort. He also reported associated symptoms of nausea, hematochezia, and general malaise. On further review of systems, he reported chills, increased fatigue, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and decreased appetite 4 days prior to presentation. He reported compliance at home with a sodium-restricted diet and medications. Physical exam was significant for abdominal distension with positive fluid wave, generalized abdominal tenderness, and splenomegaly. Scant blood was noted on the rectal exam. Laboratory studies revealed stable hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL, hematocrit of 36.8%, platelet of 83 K/UL, leukocytosis of 15.4 K/UL with 78% neutrophils and 16% bands, sodium of 130 mmol/L, ammonia of 83 Umol/L, ALT of 40 U/L, AST of 42 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase of 127 U/L. International normalized ratio (INR) was 2.02. Diagnostic paracentesis revealed serosanguinous fluid and ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) count of 686 cells/mm3, consistent with culture negative neutrocytic ascites. Blood cultures revealed no growth of organisms. The patient was started on intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone, IV pantoprazole infusion, and an IV bolus of octreotide followed by continuous infusion. He completed a 5-day course of IV ceftriaxone therapy.
The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which showed ulcerations in the distal esophagus from prior banding of small esophageal varices and diffuse portal hypertensive gastropathy (). Mucosal edema and erythema with an area of oozing of blood were identified in the duodenum bulb and between proximally located duodenal folds with no specific identifiable lesion. These findings correlated with a diagnosis of portal hypertensive duodenopathy (). Colonoscopy was performed, and it showed no active bleeding. However, there were old blood clots in the terminal ileum in addition to mild inflammation in the terminal ileum near the ileocecal valve. Video capsule endoscopy was also performed, and it revealed no active bleeding. Because of the concern of the possible failure of the patient on medical therapy for portal hypertension while awaiting liver transplant, the patient was referred for evaluation by a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). The patient successfully underwent the TIPS procedure. Follow-up occurred one month later in clinic. At this time, the patient reported resolution of the hematochezia.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 60-year-old male with the chief complaints of progressive abdominal pain and poor appetite was admitted to our department.
He previously underwent surgery for a splenic CE lesion. There was no other relevant personal or familial history.
Physical examination upon admission revealed a mass in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
Laboratory examinations (routine blood tests, routine urine tests and urinary sediment examination, routine fecal tests and occult blood test, blood biochemistry, immune indices, and infection indices) showed no apparent abnormalities.
Imaging examination with computed tomography and angiography revealed two irregular CE2 lesions (approximately 10.0 cm × 14.0 cm × 13.6 cm and 12.5 cm × 11.2 cm × 5.8 cm), respectively, located in the left upper retroperitoneal cavity and the abdomen, according to World Health Organization (WHO) classification (Figure and )[,]. The lesions mainly invaded the liver-spleen-gastric gap, superior section of the spleen, left retro-renal cavity and the abdominal aortic wall (Figure and ). There was no other abdominal organ involvement.
The patient was finally diagnosed with recurrent abdominal/retroperitoneal active CE with aortic involvement. After preoperative evaluation, abdominal hydatid excision combined with abdominal aortic stent implantation was planned and surgical treatment was performed on October 12, 2017.
Surgery was performed under general anesthesia. Following an upper abdominal incision, two round-shaped hard lesions were found. Firstly, a lesion within the abdominal cavity was carefully removed from the gastrocolic space by total cystectomy. Another retroperitoneal lesion was then observed. Considering that the retroperitoneal lesion was huge and involved the aorta, sub-total cystectomy was performed in order to protect the aorta from possible injury. The outer capsule area was exposed as much as possible and the surrounding tissues were protected by 10% saline. The capsule of the retroperitoneal lesion was opened from the left side where it could be easily operated without affecting the aorta. The inner contents were then extracted under full vision. The residual cavity was then washed with 10% saline. Aneurysmal inflammatory granulation tissue was detected on the right capsule wall adjacent to the aortic wall. During the third saline washing of the cavity, the aortic wall suddenly ruptured. Massive bleeding suddenly occurred, accompanied by a drop in blood pressure and an increase in heart rate. The bleeding section of the abdominal aorta was immediately clamped and pressed. Blood loss was estimated to be 2500 mL. The upper end of the abdominal aorta was immediately separated and blocked intermittently for 30 min each time. Hemostasis attempts were conducted to deal with this emergency situation and maintain circulation. The rupture site was at the celiac trunk level and was sutured with 3-0 proline lines in the setting of interrupted blockage of the superior and inferior sections of the aorta. A small amount of bleeding was found in the surgical area. The patient then underwent digital subtraction angiography (DSA), which showed an ulcer on the left posterior wall of the abdominal aorta (0.5 cm above the celiac arteries) and no obvious contrast agent overflow. A covered stent (VAMF2828 C150 TE, Medtronic Inc., United States) was placed in the aortic wall after angiography of the aortic section. No active bleeding was observed. Blood flow in the aorta and main branches were confirmed to be normal (Figure ). During surgery and DSA, a total of 11.5 units of erythrocyte suspension was transfused and vital signs and hemoglobin levels were maintained within normal levels. Thereafter, he was transferred to the intensive care unit, then to a general ward after 3 d, and discharged on day 13 following DSA. Postoperative pathological evaluation of the lesion was consistent with CE.
After surgery, the patient was administered albendazole 10 mg/kg/day according to expert consensus[,]. The patient was followed-up for the next two years by abdominal ultrasound examination. No abnormalities were observed during the 2-year-follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 51-year-old man suffered from progressive dysphagia to solids for over about 6 months and slow weight loss of 5 kg was referred to our institution with the presumptive diagnosis of achalasia. Preoperative workup consisted in a careful clinical history, correct interpretation of anamnesis, and symptoms; then esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and showed a dilated esophagus without evident mucosal lesion, and the passage through the cardia was more difficult: “crossing snap” passage. Manometry revealed absence of peristalsis and impaired swallow-induced LES relaxation with classic manometric pattern (). The barium swallow showed an emptying defect with “bird beak” sign and narrowing at esophageal junction (). We made a diagnosis of esophageal achalasia and performed a laparoscopic Heller's myotomy with Dor fundoplication (Figures and ). We use the laparoscopic approach to perform this kind of surgery. Several studies demonstrate that this is the best way to treat this pathology. We use Veres' needle placed in Palmer's point to create pneumoperitoneum and then we place five trocars: the first 10–12 mm trocar is placed in supraumbilical region, two 10–12 mm trocars in right and left side, and two 5 mm trocars in paraxiphoid region and left iliac region []. The surgical exploration of peritoneal cavity does not reveal any anatomic abnormality or suspect neoplastic lesions or secondary localizations. Two months after surgery, the patient complained of worsening dysphagia. We repeated several esophagogastroduodenoscopies with numerous biopsies that showed only cardia inflammation and were negative for malignancy. Tumor markers were negative too. Balloon dilatation was performed to improve symptoms. Persisting dysphagia, one month after we performed EUS with biopsies, showed infiltrating gastric adenocarcinoma of the cardia (T3 WHO, Siewert II) (). After staging CT scan, total gastroesophagectomy was performed, with D2 lymph-node resection and Roux-en-Y reconstruction. The surgical specimen contained a thick, hard tumor 3,6 × 2,5 × 1,3 cms located in the gastroesophageal junction (Siewert II), extensively infiltrating the wall and reaching in some areas the subserosal layer (Figures and ).

"A 49-year-old male presented with a history of bomb blast injury to his left elbow 25 years back, when he had sustained an open and comminuted fracture of left distal humerus with extension into the elbow joint. The injury was treated with wound debridement and cast application for 6 weeks. Distal humerus progressed to atrophic non-union, with severe deformity and stiffness of the elbow. He also had partial involvement of radial and ulnar nerves with stiffness and deformities of the fingers of the left hand. He presented to us for correction of the elbow deformity and to gain reasonable elbow and hand function.
On local examination, there were multiple scars present medially, laterally and posteriorly around his left elbow suggestive of healed wounds by secondary intention after compound injury. There was fixed flexion deformity of the elbow of 900 with further flexion up to 120 degree was possible (, ). There was partial sensory loss in the little and ring fingers and the muscle power (as per MRC grading) of the finger flexors was 3/5; wrist and those of elbow flexors was 2/5. The motor power of left fingers, wrist and elbow extensors were 1/5.
Plain radiographs revealed atrophic non-union of the supracondylar fracture along with the deformity at the distal humerus due to malunited distal humeral fracture (, ). CT scan confirmed these radiographic findings and demonstrated a significant gap at the fracture site with grossly rotated distal humeral condylar fragments and marked disuse osteopenia.
In view of grossly distorted anatomy of the distal humerus, poor bone stock, bone gap at the non-united fracture, severe elbow deformity and stiffness we preferred to go for a mega prosthetic replacement of the left elbow. Under general anaesthesia, elbow was approached posteriorly by ’Wadsworth approach’ and the fracture site was exposed. Severe fibrosis was encountered between the fractured ends of the bone, which was excised. The distal humeral condylar fragments were found to be grossly mal-positioned, osteoporosed, destructed and were not amenable to osteosynthesis or conventional total elbow replacement. Hence, the distal humeral bone fragments were excised, leading to a large bone gap at the elbow. This gap was reconstructed by using elbow mega prosthesis. Preparation for mega prosthetic replacement was done by reaming the humeral and ulnar shafts. Cemented titanium prosthesis (XLO Tm) was used for reconstruction, with ulnar stem of 132 mm and humeral stem of 175 mm length. The implant had eyes in the ulnar component for the attachment of the triceps tendon. Common flexor tendons were attached on the medial side and the common extensor tendons were attached on lateral side of triceps tendon and finally the combined tendinous complex was attached at the eye of the prosthesis with the help of non-absorbable polyester suture (Ethibond™ No. 5). Intra operatively, we could achieve good correction of the elbow deformity (with ROM of 10-1500) with stable elbow joint.
The patient was given i.v. third generation cephalosporin and aminoglycoside for a period of three days post operatively. The antibiotics were shifted to oral at the time of discharge and were continued for a period of two weeks till suture removal. The limb was kept in a splint for 2 weeks followed by physical therapy to regain the movements and function of the elbow and hand (, ). The post-operative recovery was satisfactory and uneventful. Post-operative X-ray showed good placement of the prosthesis with adequate cementation (, ).
At 12 months follow up, the the patient had significant improvement in the post-operative Mayo elbow score of 80 compared to pre-operative score of only 50. The patient could now do many of his activities of daily living with left hand, which were not possible before, apart from significant improvement in the cosmetic appearance.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 37-month-old male infant from Guangxi Province, China, with recurrent pneumonia since infancy exhibited recurrent pain in the right abdomen and fevers for 3 months. The abdominal pain was related to eating food, but not to physical activity and position. His maximum temperature was 40 °C. Physical examination revealed lymphadenopathy in the left neck and hepatomegaly. His abdomen was soft with normal bowel sounds; however, the liver and spleen were palpable 4 cm below his costal margins. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Routine blood tests revealed 16.9 × 109/L leucocytes, 9.5 × 109/L neutrophils, 4.4 × 109/L lymphocytes, 0.22 × 109/L eosinophils, and 90 g/L hemoglobin. Blood was observed in his stool. The serum albumin and C-reactive protein levels were 29.0 g/L (40–60 g/L) and > 192 mg/L (< 10 mg/L), respectively. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 28 mm/h (≤15 mm/h). Serum aspergillus galactomannan antigen was 0.826 (normal<0.5). His CD4+ T-cell count was 1078 cells/μL (normal: 410–1590 cells/μL), while the percentage of his natural killer cells was 18.10% (normal: 9–15%). Serum immunoglobulin (Ig) M was slightly elevated, while IgG and IgA were normal. Serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatinine levels, as indicated by the blood test, were all normal. Anti-nuclear and anti-HIV antibodies and INF-γ autoantibody were all negative. Blood and stool cultures were negative. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed disseminated patchy exudates throughout the left upper and lower lobes of the right lung. Contrast-enhanced CT of the whole abdomen showed hepatomegaly, intestinal wall thickening in the ascending colon, and mesenteric lymphadenopathy in the cecum with (Fig. a-b). Colonoscopy showed a cobblestone pattern (non-ulcerated mucosa separated by ulcers) with erosion, ulcer, polypoid lesions, and lumen deformation from the colon to the cecum (Fig. a-b). Crohn’s disease and intestinal tuberculosis were also considered based on the presence of multiple ulcers on colonoscopy and on the clinical manifestations. Therefore, the patient was treated with mesalazine and thalidomide for 1 week but without clinical improvement. After 5 days, the colon biopsy revealed mucosal ulceration and ulcers in the colon and massive infiltration of the mucosa and submucosa by the engorged macrophages. A large number of fungal spores were observed in the interstitial space and the macrophages (Fig. ). Subsequently, the patient underwent ultrasound-guided liver biopsy. Histopathological examination of the liver tissue revealed granulomatous inflammation (Fig. a), while periodic acid-Schiff staining revealed aggregates of macrophages engorged with numerous yeast-like organisms 2–4 μm in diameter. These yeast-like organisms were spherical to oval and had a transverse septum (Fig. b). After 2 weeks, the bone marrow culture confirmed T. marneffei, and the diagnosis of disseminated Talaromycosis involving the liver, colon, lymph nodes, and bone marrow was made. Intravenous voriconazole (12 mg/kg every 12 h) was administered for 4 weeks. Subsequently, the liver size reduced and was palpable 1 cm below the costal margin. Voriconazole was then administered orally (7 mg/kg twice a day). Unfortunately, 1 month later, his abdominal pain and fever recurred, and he presented with reduced urine output. Abdominal radiograph showed bowel perforation, pneumoperitoneum, and intestinal obstruction (Fig. ). Hence, an emergency exploratory laparotomy with intestinal resection, anastomosis, and a colostomy was performed. During the surgery, we observed the pebble sign with erosion in the ileocecal intestinal cavity. The lesion segment was approximately 8 cm long. The ileocolic junction was narrow and obstructed, and the adjacent intestinal ducts were edematous and thickened. Postoperative pathology indicated the presence of T. marneffei. Whole-exome sequencing was performed using the patient’s and his parents’ peripheral blood. A heterozygous missense mutation in exon 17 of the STAT3 gene (c.1673G>A, p.G558D) was found in the patient but not in his parents (Fig. ), indicating that the mutations were de novo.
The patient’s condition improved after the administration of intravenous voriconazole and antibiotics for 10 days and oral voriconazole for 7 months. Seven months after the surgery, repeat colonoscopy showed good recovery of the stoma located at the ileocecum, within 35 cm from the anal verge (Fig. c). No relapse was observed during the 18-month period of antifungal treatment.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 41-year-old man was referred to the outpatient clinic of Dermatology, Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, by surgical gastroenterologist for evaluation. He presented with asymptomatic skin lesions over the abdomen and front of neck of 3-year duration. For the last one and a half year he is having early morning fatigue, tremor, sweating and difficulty in holding objects. He was earlier diagnosed by a neurologist to have absence seizures and was put on anticonvulsants but there was no relief. He also gave a past history of two episodes of ureteric colic 6 years back. General examination was normal except for an increased arm span (height -165 cm, arm span - 179 cm) and an elevated blood pressure of 160/100 mm of Hg.
Dermatological examination revealed multiple discrete skin-colored soft as well as firm dome-shaped smooth papules of 0.5 cm diameter over the abdomen and lateral aspect of trunk []. A single 2 × 1 cm hyperpigmented macule with serrated margins was seen over the right side of chest []. Multiple discrete brownish macules as well as hyperpigmented and erythematous papules were seen over the anterior and lateral aspect of neck and pre-sternal area []. A single whitish papule of 0.5 cm was seen over the right lower gingival mucosa []. Examination of other systems was normal.
With these findings, the possibility of steatocystoma multiplex or neurofibroma or collagenoma with angiofibroma and café-au-lait macules was considered. In view of the late-onset cutaneous tumors and associated systemic symptoms, the patient was subjected to detailed investigations. The routine blood and urine examinations as well as liver and renal function tests were normal. Serum calcium level was 11mg% and serum phosphorus was decreased (1.9 mg%; normal value: 2.5 - 4.5 mg %). Random blood sugar was 51mg%. In view of the repeatedly low blood sugar values, serum insulin was measured. It was found that serum insulin was elevated (112.47 μIu/ ml; normal value: 2-25 μIu/ml) with an increased insulin/glucose ratio (2.205) and a slightly raised C-peptide level (4.16 mg/ml; normal value 1-3 mg/ml). The detection of hyper insulinemia prompted us to do a detailed endocrinological evaluation. Serum parathormone was elevated (151.4 pg/ml; normal value: 15-75 pg/ml) whereas the other hormones like thyroid hormones, cortisol, gastrin and prolactin were normal. Ultrasonographical examination of neck revealed a hypoechoic lesion of 5.3×11 mm seen posterior to the right lobe of thyroid suggestive of parathyroid adenoma. Visual field examination, OGD scopy and X-ray skull were normal. Plain CAT scan of the abdomen showed a tumor involving the body and tail of pancreas and multiple calculi were noted in the left kidney. CAT scan of head was normal but MRI brain showed a space-occupying lesion in the pituitary suggestive of pituitary adenoma [].
Skin biopsy of the papules over the abdomen showed normal epidermis with increased dense connective tissue in the dermis which on subjecting to Van Gieson's stain- a mixture of Picric acid and Acid Fuchsin- took up red color confirming the diagnosis of collagenoma []. Erythematous papule on the pre-sternal area for which a provisional diagnosis of angiofibroma was made, showed hyperkeratosis, acanthosis and dilated blood vessels in the upper dermis with perivascular infiltrate which was more in favor of seborrhoeic keratosis rather than angiofibroma. Thus a final diagnosis of MEN type 1 was arrived at. The patient underwent parathyroidectomy and enucleation of the pancreatic tumor. The serum insulin level was normalized and his hypoglycemic symptoms disappeared after the surgical treatment.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"This patient is a 29-year-old white woman from the USA with a medical history significant for severe IBS-D (diagnosed at age 12) and anxiety disorder. In July 2015, she presented with severe bleeding hemorrhoids secondary to IBS, which required hemorrhoidectomy and anal sphincterotomy in August 2015. The week before the surgery she developed pharyngitis and was treated with azithromycin, which resulted in mucousy diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. She tested negative for C. difficile antigen and toxins at that time.
A week after surgery, she developed a perirectal abscess that had formed at the site of the sphincterotomy and was prescribed orally administered ciprofloxacin. Despite moderate symptom improvement, in September 2015 she required an abscess incision and drainage procedure and Penrose drain insertion. Prior to the surgery she was given a single dose of clindamycin. An additional 2-week course of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole was then prescribed. In late September 2015 she was admitted to the hospital for two nights due to further complications related to the abscess and was then diagnosed as having a perianal fistula.
In November 2015, she was prescribed clindamycin for an episode of group C streptococcal-positive pharyngitis. In late November 2015, she was also diagnosed as having Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, which according to her medical record may partially explain the poor wound healing from the perirectal abscess. In December 2015, her fistula required an anus seton placement. She was treated with multiple courses of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole off and on from December 2015 to January 2016.
In January 2016, following up on her recurrent pharyngitis, she was diagnosed as having chronic tonsillitis which led to tonsillectomy. In February 2016, 2 weeks after the surgery she was prescribed clindamycin. At the beginning of March 2016, she was diagnosed as having bacterial vaginosis and was prescribed orally administered metronidazole. A week later she was diagnosed as having vaginal candidiasis and was prescribed orally administered fluconazole. In April 2016, she complained of dysuria and was prescribed ciprofloxacin. After 2 days, when urine analysis results came back negative, she was asked by her physician to stop the treatment.
In June 2016, she presented for follow-up with ongoing diarrhea and abdominal pain. She was diagnosed as having C. difficile diarrhea, her antigen and toxins laboratory results were indeterminate, and a toxigenic strain was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). She was prescribed a 6-week course of orally administered vancomycin. After a week of treatment her symptoms worsened, and following discussion with her gastroenterologist her treatment was switched to a 2-week course of metronidazole. Hours later, she was admitted to the hospital for a 4-day period for colitis. Her C. difficile antigen and toxin test returned negative during her admission. She received intravenously administered metronidazole treatment during her hospitalization. Her symptoms improved during her hospital stay, with 1–2 soft bowel movements a day. At discharge her metronidazole course was stopped and she was again prescribed vancomycin, which she took for over a month. She continued to experience GI irregularity (3–5 bowel movements a day) beyond what she had experienced secondary to her IBS prior to her surgeries. In March 2017, she was prescribed rifaximin for 2 weeks to treat chronic diarrhea.
In November 2017, she was prescribed a series of clinical intestinal tests (SmartGut™, uBiome Inc., San Francisco, USA) with the instructions to administer the test at home whenever she was experiencing a noticeable change of GI symptoms, then follow-up with her health care provider to discuss the results. This sequencing-based test requires that patients use a sterile swab to transfer a small amount of fecal material from toilet paper into a vial containing a lysis and stabilization buffer that preserves the microbial DNA for transport by mail back to the laboratory for processing, which involves DNA extraction, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplification, and sequencing []. She first used this test in November 2017, about a month after completing a 2-week course of rifaximin. The results revealed a number of microbial organisms that were outside the healthy reference ranges, but she was negative for all pathogenic organisms included in the test, including C. difficile (Fig. ).
Between November and December 2017, her GI symptoms worsened considerably; her daily bowel movements increased from 3–4 to 6–10, stool consistency became more mucous-like and gelatinous, and she was experiencing more pain with defecation. She re-tested with SmartGut™ test again in January 2018. Her results continued to reveal a number of microbial organisms outside the healthy range and, this time, her sample also indicated the presence of C. difficile (Fig. ). She immediately contacted her primary care provider, who re-tested her for C. difficile and confirmed indeterminate CDI by antigen and toxins A and B. Additional PCR testing at a regional laboratory confirmed the sample was positive for a toxigenic C. difficile strain. As a result of testing, her clinician started her on fidaxomicin; her symptoms improved rapidly. By April 2018, she had returned to her baseline in regard to her IBS-related GI symptoms with no blood in her stools.
In addition, the second SmartGut™ sample was tested for toxins A and B by sequencing at uBiome Inc. laboratory in San Francisco, USA, which resulted positive for both and confirmed the toxigenic nature of the C. difficile strain.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year. Exclusion Criteria: Younger than 65 years old, having decompensated liver disease, psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance, having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy.",1
"A 31-year-old man, originally from Morocco, was admitted to Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC, The Netherlands) complaining of leg edema in February 2000. The patient had a history of recurrent episodes of inflammation, fever and serositis. The patient was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome due to amyloidosis secondary to FMF. His family had 7 siblings with consanguineous parents. At that time, no genetic mutations were found. After another episode of FMF in 2009, the patient presented with renal failure and nephrotic syndrome that did not respond to conservative therapy (angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cyclosporine and colchicine). He was suspected not to be compliant with treatment. A bilateral nephrectomy was performed to halt the progressive catabolism due to unrestrained renal protein loss. The patient, a Dutch resident, required chronic dialysis. At this time, there was no evidence of clinical cardiac involvement by amyloidosis. In 2011, he received a left kidney transplant from his elder brother, a resident of Spain, who had no medical history of note (the preoperative evaluation of his clinical status and renal function were unremarkable). The kidney donation and transplantation were performed in the Netherlands. The recipient received a standard immunosuppression protocol (cyclosporine, mycophenolic acid and prednisolone). After transplantation, the recipient’s postoperative course was unsatisfactory, with a 10% decrease in serum creatinine levels on 3 consecutive days during the first postoperative week. His renal function subsequently improved, although slowly, and he developed massive proteinuria (18 g/day) and elevated serum amyloid A levels and was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome. A graft transplant biopsy showed extensive amyloid deposition. The patient underwent treatment with colchicine (0.5 mg/12 h, adjusted for renal function), anakinra (100 mg/day), prednisolone (10 mg/day), mycophenolic acid (540 mg/12 h) and cyclosporine (150 mg/12 h). After 6 months, the patient presented a serum creatinine level of 2.10 mg/dL (185.6 μmol/L) and proteinuria of 0.25 g/day. After 20 months, the graft was functioning well, with a serum creatinine level of 2.40 mg/dL (212.1 μmol/L), undetectable serum amyloid A levels and proteinuria of 0.20 g/day. After 62 months and at the time of this report, his serum creatinine was 2.05 mg/dL (182 μmol/L), Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) value of 35 mL/min/1.73 m2 and proteinuria of 0.44 g/day.
An apparently healthy 45-year-old man, originally from Morocco and a resident of Spain for 12 years, was considered a living kidney donor for his younger brother. His medical history and examination was compatible for a living related kidney donation procedure. A thorough physical examination showed no abnormalities, and the laboratory work-up included urine analysis, urine culture, blood test and liver function, the results of which were all within normal ranges. Other studies revealed a serum creatinine level of 1 mg/dL (88.4 μmol/L), creatinine clearance of 113 mL/min/1.73 m2, a 24-h urine protein level of 100 mg and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 6 mg/dL (normal range < 5 mg/dL). A computed tomography (CT) angiography of his abdomen showed both kidneys had a perfect configuration with a single renal artery and vein, a normal excretory system and normal appearance of the bladder. After the kidney donation in 2011, the patient presented nausea, vomiting and diarrhea and developed an erysipelas-like erythema of the lower legs. On the fifth postoperative day, he presented a serum creatinine level of 2.08 mg/dL (184 μmol/L). With the diagnosis of prerenal renal failure, the patient was started on IV fluids, which resulted in partially improved renal function. He was released from hospital on the seventh day after the kidney transplantation and was readmitted 3 days later for dyspnea and chest pain. At that time, his serum creatinine level had increased to 2.20 mg/dL (197 μmol/L). Nineteen days after the transplantation, the patient presented a serum creatinine level of 4.80 mg/dL (424.3 μmol/L), proteinuria of 25 g/day and a serum amyloid A level of 85 mg/L. A renal biopsy showed 8 glomeruli, one of which was globally sclerosed and all were pathological. There was extensive expansion of the mesangium, with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive eosinophilic material, which also caused occlusion of the glomerular capillaries. The eosinophilic material also invaded the blood vessels and was stained with Congo Red. The interstitium presented fibrosis and a diffuse lymphocytic infiltrate. There was also a component of acute tubular necrosis with regeneration. The patient underwent treatment with colchicine (0.5-1 mg/12 h, adjusted for renal function) and anakinra (100 mg/day). After 4 weeks, the patient presented a serum creatinine level of 3.80 mg/dL (339 μmol/L), proteinuria of 16 g/day and an undetectable serum amyloid A level. Treatment with candesartan (2 mg/day) was then started. Fourteen weeks after the kidney donation, the patient had a serum creatinine level of 1.93 mg/dL (171 μmol/L) and proteinuria of 7.5 g/day. He remained on regular colchicine (0.5 mg/12 h), anakinra (100 mg/48 h), candesartan (4 mg/day) and enalapril (5 mg/day) for 4 months. After 20 months, the patient was in good clinical condition. The serum creatinine level had stabilized at 1.50 mg/dL (132.6 μmol/L), creatinine clearance was 61 mL/min/1.73 m2 (MDRD of 53.3 mL/min/1.73 m2), and proteinuria was 2.6 g/day. An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 60%. Although the possibility of anakinra withdrawal was considered, we decided on indefinite therapy with anakinra and colchicine due to the satisfactory response. After 62 months and at the time of this report, the patient was taking colchicine (0.5 mg/12 h), anakinra (100 mg/48 h) and atorvastatin (40 mg/day). His serum creatinine level was 1.40 mg/dL (123.7 μmol/L), his creatinine clearance was 67.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 (MDRD of 55.7 mL/min/1.73 m2) and his proteinuria was 1.1 g/day.
An initial genetic study on the recipient was conducted in 2000 with negative results. A second genetic analysis was performed in 2011 after the living transplantation on both brothers. Briefly, genomic DNA was prepared from 200 μL of whole blood, using a commercial kit. Hot spot testing for exons 2 (c.278 to c.910) and exon 10 (c.1900 to c.2346) of the FMF gene (MEFV), as well as exons 3, 4-5, 6-7 including introns 2,4 and exons 6 9, 11, by direct PCR and automated sequencing revealed homozygosity in the MEFV gene (c.2082G > A; p.M694I; National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London Medical School, London, UK). The reason p.M694I was not found in 2000 is not known, given that this founder mutation had been already described in 1998 [, ]. This missense mutation has a founder effect in the African Mediterranean population (Lebanon 12.6%; Tunisia; 13%, Syria 4.8%; Egypt 20.6%), and dates back more than 8500 years (Lebanon) (Mediterranean Founder Mutation Database). This change has been established as a pathogenic variant (Clin Var: RCV000220431.2) in a recessive condition.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 40-year-old woman originally from Ecuador was referred to our institution for evaluation of progressive dyspnea on exertion. Two months prior to her presentation, she was treated at an outside hospital for presumed community acquired pneumonia with symptoms of dyspnea on exertion, fevers, chills, and productive cough. After not seeing measurable improvement, the patient then presented to the emergency department at another institution where a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed that the patient had a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology and a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60%. Pericardiocentesis was performed with 700 cc of fluid removed, which grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). The patient's purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test was positive. The patient was started on anti-TB therapy and discharged.
She continued to complain of persistent dyspnea on exertion and thus was referred to our institution for a repeat of TTE at the outpatient cardiac diagnostic center. TTE revealed the rare presystolic flow through pulmonic valve, excessive variation in the mitral valve and aortic valve spectral Doppler velocities, and markedly thickened pericardium (Figures –), consistent with constriction []. The study also demonstrated septal bounce, small pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion. The patient was admitted for further evaluation. On admission, the patient's vital signs showed a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, a blood pressure of 108/70, a heart rate of 117, and respiratory rate of 20 with an oxygen saturation of 99% in room air. Her exam revealed a young woman in mild distress with 11 cm internal jugular vein distension, decreased breath sounds at lung bases bilaterally and scant bibasilar crackles, regular tachycardia, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Her BNP was 124, CRP was 5.1, and WBC count was 5.9 with a normal differential. Her complete metabolic panel was unremarkable. The patient underwent a left and right heart catheterization due to the suspicion of constrictive pericarditis. A coronary angiogram demonstrated no obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease. The right heart catheterization revealed elevated right atrial pressure, right ventricular end diastolic pressure, and an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Simultaneous right and left ventricular pressure tracings demonstrated discordant respiratory variation consistent with constrictive pericarditis. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her chest with contrast confirmed marked thickening of both the parietal and pleural pericardial surfaces, measuring up to 13.4 mm in thickness, and a large right-sided pleural effusion (Figures and ). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast showed diffuse pericardial thickening (), which showed intense delayed gadolinium contrast enhancement () that did not involve the myocardium. Additionally, there was a greater interventricular septal bounce during diastole and inspiration, consistent with chronic inflammatory constrictive pericarditis.
Due to her worsening symptoms and diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis, she was referred to cardiothoracic surgery at our institution for pericardiectomy. The surgery was without incident and the surgical samples were sent for pathology. While being negative for AFB by concentrated smear and culture, the stripped pericardium showed noncaseating granulomas, extensive fibrosis, and severe lymphohistiocytic infiltrate.
In the immediate postoperative period, the patient began to develop signs and symptoms of central volume overload, heart failure, and hypotension. An electrocardiogram (ECG) at this time showed sinus tachycardia with nonspecific ST-T abnormalities with poor R wave progression, new from prior ECGs. A subsequent TTE on postoperative day one showed significant changes from the prior study, with severely decreased biventricular dysfunction. The LVEF was severely depressed at 26%, with early evidence of elevated filling pressure within the left ventricle, indicated by the time difference between pulmonary vein (Ar) duration and mitral A-wave duration (Ar-A) of positive 46 ms. For the right ventricle, fractional area change (FAC) was abnormally low at 29%, with reduced tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) distance of 0.96 cm. There was also moderate tricuspid regurgitation, enlarged right atrium (area 27 cm2), and moderately elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 41 mmHg. There was akinesis of the entire apical and midventricular segments of both the right and left ventricles (Figures –) with hypercontractile base. Findings were consistent with stress cardiomyopathy.
While in critical condition postoperatively, the patient had episodes of atrial fibrillation and atrial tachycardia, for which she was chemically cardioverted with intravenous amiodarone, with subsequent conversion to sinus rhythm. Initially, the patient required multiple vasopressors and inotropes (epinephrine, norepinephrine, milrinone, and dopamine drip) to maintain her blood pressure and cardiac output, while gentle diuresis was achieved carefully for the symptoms of heart failure. Once the patient was hemodynamically stable, she was placed on appropriate oral medical therapy, including carvedilol and furosemide, followed by gradual clinical improvement and was able to be discharged on postoperative day 10. Due to decreased urine output and hypotension, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker was not initiated at the time. A posthospital TTE 7 weeks after discharge showed normalized function of both the right and left ventricles (Figures –).","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 15-year-old male patient visited the clinic due to vesiculopapular eruptions on the face and neck. He suffered from atopic dermatitis also from infancy, but it was abruptly aggravated during the past week. He received standard treatment thereafter showing persistent fluctuation. He received Histobulin therapy through 24 injections, and the clinical severity scores improved gradually from 26.1 to 14.2 after 24 Histobulin injections (Figure ). The MAST results showed that 2 allergens were positive (A alternata 100 <and Dp 2.40) before treatment and 2 allergens were positive (A alternata 100 <and Dp 2.40) after treatment. In the skin test, no allergens showed a positive reaction before or after treatment.

"A 43-year-old woman presented with post-Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccination keloid scars on both shoulders. A protruding lesion had developed at the center of the keloid scar on her right shoulder 3 months prior. The lesion had increased in size, and she had squeezed out the lesion's contents several times. However, the lesion had become swollen again and was painful. When she visited our clinic, the lesion had already ruptured, and inflammation had spread to the surrounding keloid scar tissue. The keloid scar on the patient's right shoulder measured about 9 × 7 cm, and the ruptured lesion measured 2 × 1.5 cm (Fig. A). We excised all the keloid tissue including the ruptured lesion, and repaired the wound using subdermal 3-0 PDS (Ethicon, Inc., Somerville, NJ) and interrupted 5-0 Ethilone (Ethicon, Inc.) sutures, primarily (Fig. B–D). Histopathologically, a large laminated keratin-filled cyst was present in the dermis surrounded with a dense collagenous keloid scar (Fig. E). The cyst wall consisted of stratified squamous epithelium with a granular layer, which was consistent with an EC. The adjacent dermis contained characteristic broad, eosinophilic, and homogeneous keloidal collagen bundles (Fig. F). There were no postoperative complications, such as an infection or wound dehiscence. The stitches were removed 14 days postoperatively, and Steri-Strip skin closures were applied for 1 month to prevent wound dehiscence and scar widening. Subsequently, the patient used Mepiform and applied a personalized compression garment for 5 months (Fig. G and H). There were no EC recurrences or keloid overgrowth during the 1-year follow-up period, and the patient was satisfied with the final outcome.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"CU is a Caucasian female, aged 16 years old at presentation, with moderate ID (IQ =40–54), no previous psychiatric history, and a family history of anxiety in a first-degree relative. At baseline, CU attended school and functioned at preschool level. Recent stressors included parental marital stress and family relocation. Symptoms were first noted 2.5 years prior to presentation, when she was diagnosed with a presumed Hashimoto’s encephalopathy at an outside institution. At that time, her symptoms included grimacing, eye blinking, and decline in functioning. She was noted to have elevated thyroglobulin antibodies (711 IU/mL) and marginally increased thyroid peroxidase antibodies (45 units/mL) but normal thyroid stimulating hormone, and free T4 and T3 levels. Routine spinal fluid analysis, EEGs, and brain MRI were normal. Oral prednisone was initiated with some improvement, although it is unclear how long she remained well. Two years later, she presented to our institution, with reoccurrence of symptoms of 7 months’ duration. Symptoms included periods of prolonged immobility, agitation, repetitive and darting eye movements, involuntary movements of the mouth and flicking movements of her fingers, depressed mood, decline in ADL, apparent loss of hedonic capacity, staring, and decreased speech output.
In addition to routine medical tests, thyroid functions, thyroglobulin antibody, and thyroid microsomal antibody; single-nucleotide polymorphism chromosomal microarray; creatinine phosphokinase; hepatitis A, B and C antibodies; paraneoplastic antibody (immunoglobulin G N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor); 25 hydroxy vitamin D; brain MRI; and, EEG disclosed no significant abnormalities.
CU was diagnosed with unspecified catatonia. Symptoms supporting the catatonia diagnosis included reduced motor activity, episodes of increased activity, grimacing, stereotyped finger movements, staring, reduced speech, and decline in skill level. Mood symptoms, not specific to the catatonia diagnosis, were also noted. An oral challenge dose of lorazepam 1 mg resulted in an immediate but short-lived improvement. Lorazepam was gradually increased to a maximum dose of 5.5 mg four times daily with limited improvement in symptoms. Lamotrigine was later added and titrated up to 150 mg daily for mood stabilization with no significant impact. Due to progressive decline, ECT was initiated. At the time of writing this report, CU has received 86 bilateral ECT treatments over a 6-month period with notable improvement. Her mother believes CU has regained 100% of her baseline functioning. There are no reported symptoms 5 months after discontinuing ECT. She continues to receive lorazepam 10 mg/day and memantine 20 mg/day and is closely monitored for recurrence of symptoms.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 29-year-old female in her second pregnancy, with a history of tetralogy of Fallot or ventricular septal defect with pulmonary atresia, had undergone 4 surgeries during her childhood, including a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt, patch repair of ventricular septal defect, and a right ventricle (RV) to pulmonary artery (PA) conduit. At 20 weeks’ gestation during her first pregnancy, she developed severe symptomatic stenosis of the RV to PA conduit with a Doppler gradient of 98 mmHg, thus requiring a 22-mm balloon dilatation and Genesis XD stent as a temporizing measure until definitive repair could be undertaken postpartum. However, she was lost to follow-up after delivery of her first child and did not undergo postpartum repair of her RV to PA conduit stenosis.
The patient presented to our clinic during her second pregnancy at 21 weeks of gestation. Thus far, her pregnancy had been uncomplicated and prenatal testing to date had found no abnormalities in fetal development. On presentation, she admitted to mild dyspnea on exertion at a distance of 20 yards. On examination, the patient was tachycardic and normotensive with normal oxygenation. She was euvolemic with hemoglobin of 13.5 g/dL and creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL. Echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60% to 65%, with mild right atrial (RA) dilatation, evidence of RV hypertrophy, and an estimated RV pressure of 82 mmHg. The PA conduit was severely stenosed, with a mean gradient of 52 mmHg and unrestricted pulmonic valve insufficiency. Our assessment determined her modified World Health Organization (WHO) pregnancy risk classification to be II-III (moderately increased risk of maternal mortality and moderate morbidity).
She was seen again in clinic at 34 weeks’ gestation. Her symptoms and repeat echocardiogram were unchanged from the previous visit. However, at 36.5 weeks’ gestation, 2-dimensional echocardiogram done in preparation for delivery identified severe conduit stenosis with a mean gradient of >75 mmHg, peak gradient of 98 mmHg with a peak velocity of 5 m/s, and unrestricted pulmonic valve insufficiency. The patient's RV pressures at the time also exceeded 71 mmHg. Despite the severe restenosis and unrestricted insufficiency of her PA conduit, her symptoms remained New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II. The plan was to admit the patient prior to cesarean section for assessment of heart failure and bilateral tubal ligation at 37 weeks’ gestation.
As planned, she was admitted at 37 weeks for delivery and was cared for by a multidisciplinary team involving obstetrics, ACHD specialists, heart failure specialists, obstetric anesthesia, maternal fetal medicine, and the neonatal intensive care unit.
The patient underwent a successful low transverse cesarean section and bilateral tubal ligation under epidural block with an estimated blood loss of 1,100 mL. Postdelivery echocardiogram showed normal LVEF of 55% to 60%, RA and RV dilatation with RV hypertrophy, and no change in RV pressure or valve gradient. The RV to PA conduit stenosis had decreased to a peak velocity of <4.8 m/s and a mean gradient of <56 mmHg with unrestricted insufficiency.
The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course, only requiring some gentle hydration, and was discharged 3 days postpartum. She was scheduled for follow-up for severe conduit stenosis at 6 weeks postpartum to discuss management options.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.
