"A 5.5-year-old boy visited the Endocrinological section of the Pediatric Unit of the General Hospital of Terni, Italy, due to short stature. His mother's height was 170 cm, and his father's height was 172 cm (target height: 177.5 cm = >50° centile). In his family history, there was paternal familiarity for psychotic crises in his adolescence and mother with thrombophilia and history of five pregnancies with three spontaneous abortions and two parts. The mother took cardioaspirine during the pregnancy. No genetic disease was reported in his family. The child was born at term via spontaneous vaginal delivery. The birth weight was 3.050 gr (10°-25° centile), and the birth length was 45 cm (below the third centile). A villocentesis performed at week 12 of gestation due to an alteration in nuchal translucency on obstetric ultrasound did not reveal any abnormality (46, XY). After birth, a small ventricular septal defect and mild bilateral pyelectasis were detected, but within 6 months, both of these abnormalities spontaneously disappeared. Bilateral orchiopexy was performed at 19 months of age for undescended testicles. Regarding linear growth, auxological data recorded by the primary care pediatrician revealed short stature that was 2 standard deviation (SD) below the 3° centile on the Italian cross-sectional growth charts for height () since the first months of life. In the last 2 years, the child has exhibited an even more exacerbated decline in his growth curve. Before entering the hospital, first-level laboratory tests for the evaluation of short stature (i.e., full blood count, inflammatory markers, renal function, hepatic function, coeliac screening, and thyroid function tests) had been already performed. No abnormal results were evidenced. The bone age was delayed by 2 years.
In the hospital, his height was 99.2 cm (<3 SD), his weight was 15.5 kg (<3° centile), and his growth velocity was 4 cm/year (<3° centile). His arm span was of 94 cm, and his sitting height was of 55 cm: height ratio was <95%, his sitting height: height ratio was therefore >56% (slightly over the upper normal limit of 55.5%), and his body mass index was below the 50th centile (pathological Rappold index >8). Furthermore, he presented with unusual facial features that included hypertelorism, low-set ears, a low posterior hairline, down-slanting palpebral fissures, pectus excavatum, and ogival palate (Figure ).
However, Madelung deformity was not suggested by clinical examination and not detected by wrist X-ray findings. Radiological and laboratory tests to rule out related renal, cardiac, ophthalmologic, and audiological abnormalities did not find any significant alterations. At an evaluation conducted by an infant neuropsychiatrist, the patient exhibited a mild cognitive impairment compared with the standard for his age that included a prevalent verbal difficulty compatible with the diagnosis of NS. EEG and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging results were normal. The peak growth hormone (GH) value in a clonidine stimulation test was in the normal range (12.7 mg/L). The IGF-1 level was 47 ng/mL (normal values for age: 32–259 ng/mL).
Although short stature was disproportionate, diagnosis of NS was suspected, and genetic tests of the PTPN11 gene were requested. The entire coding regions and intron-exon boundaries of the PTPN11 gene were amplificated by polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA and sequence specific primers. Both forward and reverse strands were directly sequenced using an automatic DNA sequencer. The results confirmed NS because a c.922A>G (rs28933386) heterozygous mutation in exon 8 of the PTPN11 gene leading to a p.Asn308Asp substitution was identified (reference transcript NCBI NM_002834.3 and NP002825.3). This mutation has already been described as pathogenic by Siegfried et al. ().
Due to the presence of a mesomelic short stature, the concurrent presence of two genetic mutations was considered and a genetic evaluation of the SHOX gene was requested. A test of chromosomal microarray analysis performed with the CGH array led to the identification of a micro-duplication at the level of the region PAR 1 (Xp22.33/Yp11.32) extended about 680 kb involving the SHOX gene. The microduplication in the pseudoautosomal region PAR1 has already been described in NS and its clinical significance therefore appears to be certain ().
GH treatment (0.2 mg/kg/wk) was prescribed. At a follow-up assessment 18 months after the initiation of GH treatment (weight-appropriate dosage), the following data were collected: height, 109.8 cm (<2 SD); weight, 18 kg (<3° centile); growth velocity, 7 cm/year (>90° centile); arm span:height ratio, 96%; sitting height:height ratio: 56%. Further evaluations have been scheduled for every 6 months.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 40-year-old male with no past medical history was found unconscious by bystanders after he had been out for a recreational jog. Upon the arrival of medical services, the patient was found to be in VF cardiac arrest and required two shocks before the return of spontaneous circulation. The downtime was reported to be about 15 minutes. Per history obtained from family members, the patient had never experienced any cardiac symptoms such as palpitations or chest pain and had no COVID-19 symptoms.
The patient had no significant personal medical history, took no medications, and exercised regularly with no difficulties. Family history was notable for coronary artery disease (CAD) in his brother, which had been diagnosed at age 50, and myocardial infarction (MI) in his father at age 72. There was no family history of sudden cardiac death.
Given the patient’s young age and absence of underlying cardiac issues, the differentials for his VF arrest were broad. Etiologies considered included ischemic heart disease, structural heart diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, anomalous origin of coronary arteries, myocarditis, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, primary electrical abnormalities such as long QT syndrome, and Brugada syndrome, and non-cardiac etiologies such as a massive pulmonary embolism (PE).
A basic metabolic panel showed no significant electrolyte abnormalities. The initial troponin-T level was within normal limits. Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission showed normal sinus rhythm, non-specific T-wave changes in anteroseptal leads, and a QTc of 445 ms (Figure ). A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal LV systolic and diastolic functions with no valvular pathology or regional wall motion abnormalities. A chest CT with PE protocol showed no significant pulmonary emboli. Per institutional policy, the patient was tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) via nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which returned positive. A subsequent SARS-CoV-2 antibody test was also positive.
The patient was emergently intubated for airway protection and taken to the catheterization lab where coronary angiography showed non-obstructive proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery disease with 55-60% stenosis and flow distal to the lesion with Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score of 3. Left circumflex and right coronary arteries were disease-free (Figures , ). The left ventriculogram showed normal systolic function with no wall motion abnormalities. The patient was then admitted to the ICU for therapeutic hypothermia. He received convalescent plasma, remdesivir, and dexamethasone for his COVID-19 infection. During his ICU stay, he had one episode of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the setting of agitation and hypoxia that terminated spontaneously in less than three seconds. He continued to improve and was eventually extubated and discharged home.
Later on, an outpatient single-photon emission CT (SPECT) pharmacological myocardial perfusion scan showed no anterior ischemia or scar (Figure ). A subsequent cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging showed normal LV and RV sizes and functions with no late gadolinium enhancement. The patient eventually received a single-chamber VVI implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) for secondary prevention of VF. Subsequent outpatient genetic testing with INVITAE® Arrhythmia and Cardiomyopathy Comprehensive Panel (Invitae, San Francisco, CA) revealed no genetic variants known to cause arrhythmia. At the one- and four-month follow-ups, the patient remained asymptomatic and ICD interrogation revealed normal sinus rhythm with no episodes of arrhythmia.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

We gave non-invasive ventilation (CPAP) support with Fio2 80%, pressure support 14, and PEEP 7 (cm H2O). On the third day of CPAP therapy, the patient was unable to maintain oxygen saturation (SpO2 < 92%) despite FiO2 100% and became more tachypnic (RR > 40). There was increased respiratory distress and SpO2 decreased to <90% despite FiO2 100%. We gave supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula with O2 flow 10 L by another flowmeter (). The patient became more comfortable, and SpO2 increased to 95%. ABG showed PO2 90 mm Hg, PCO2 35, and SpO2 97%.

"A 73-year-old male, medical doctor, widower for 2 years, lives in the house with his two children. He is a social ethicist, smoker for 40 years, and quitted smoking 18 years ago as a response for the diagnosis of pulmonary emphysema, asthma, and systemic arterial hypertension (SAH). 10 years ago, he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. For the long-term asthmatic status, he uses formoterol fumarate dihydrate 200 mg with bisoprolol hemifumarate 1.25 mg daily (inhaled bronchial dilator) 1x daily; for systemic arterial hypertension, losartan and hydrochlorothiazide 50/12.5 mg (morning and afternoon); for dyslipidemia, rosuvastatin 20 mg, AAS 100 mg.
Two months after starting SC, the patient reported having an important hypoglycemic attack (glucose level of 27 mg/dl) (). 3 hours after starting this episode, this patient still presented dysarthria, mental confusion, and loss of consciousness and was hospitalized in the ICU with good recovery after glucose replacement. The use of SC was suspended during the hospitalization period, and the medication for diabetes was resumed. After dismissal from the hospital, SC was reintroduced at a dose of 25 mg 3 times per day, and postprandial glucose remained around 138 mg/dl, even when consuming sweets; sulfonylurea (gliclazide) has been discontinued and home glycemia ranged from 101 to 117 mg/dl.

"A 58-year-old female patient, who was a known case of hypertension and hypothyroidism taking tablet L-thyroxine 50 mcg once a day and tablet metoprolol 25 mg twice a day regularly presented on 17th April 2020 with chief complaints of low-grade intermittent fever, generalized body ache, running nose and soreness of throat for last 3 days. Her reverse transcriptase by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 was done at Civil hospital, which returned positive. Her husband was also symptomatic for COVID-19 and was also tested positive. Both were admitted in Civil hospital on 19/4/2020. Her chest laboratory parameters including complete blood count and X-ray were normal []. She was treated with azithromycin 500 mg once a day for 3 days along with paracetamol 500 mg thrice daily apart from multivitamins. Patient became asymptomatic after 2 days. Her repeat RT-PCR for COVID-19 was done on 28th and 29th April 2020 which both returned negative after which she was discharged on 29th April 2020. Her husband had COVID-19 pneumonia for which he remained hospitalized in civil hospital for 23 days and was subsequently discharged on her regular medication for hypertension and hypothyroidism at home. She was asymptomatic for almost next 4 months.
On 17th August 2020, she again developed symptoms in form of intermittent 101°F fever, generalized body ache, dry cough, and throat pain. Her rapid antigen test (RAT) returned positive. Her husband was negative on this occasion. Patient needed rehospitalisation on 19th August 2020 where her RT PCR for COVID-19 also returned positive with cycle threshold (CT score) of 18 suggestive of high viral load, thus confirming a case of reinfection with COVID-19. Total antibody and immunoglobulin G antibody test for COVID-19 were negative suggestive of non-existent immunoglobulin memory from previous COVID-19 infection. Her inflammatory profile revealed CRP of 17.8 mg/L and IL-6 of 15.4 pg/ml with otherwise normal X-ray chest (shown below) and other reports. Patient was subsequently discharged after being afebrile for 5 days.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 62-year-old, white, Caucasian, British-origin, male lorry driver was admitted to the hospital late on a Friday night after an unwitnessed single vehicle road accident. His lorry was by the side of the road and he was found unconscious in the vehicle and immediately transferred to the local District General Hospital. On admission, he had already fully recovered, being alert and orientated but he had no recollection of the accident. He was haemodynamically stable, with normal vital signs and no neurological deficit. He complained only at a moderate headache. Physical examination has revealed a bruise on the upper part of his left anterior chest wall, left shoulder and forehead. The rest of the examination was entirely normal. The radiological investigation that followed included cervical spine and left arm X-rays in which no fracture was noted. A mobile AP chest X-ray was also done on admission, in which it was demonstrated a dilated aortic arch (). A subarachnoid hemorrhage was found on a moderate quality brain CT-scan (), which was attributed to traumatic brain injury and the patient was transferred to the regional Neurosurgical centre as a post-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage for observation. During the next two days, the patient was well without any neurological defect and he has been gradually mobilized without any major complaint. On Monday however, brain CT interpretation by a more senior member of the medical staff suggested that this may not be a post-traumatic but rather an aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A CT angiogram confirmed that his SAH was of aneurismal origin, due to the rupture of an anterior communicating artery (Acom) aneurysm () which was the actual reason for his accident. As the patient was neurologically intact and stable, an embolisation procedure for endovascular treatment of this aneurysm was decided for the following day (day 5 since the SAH event). Under general anesthesia, the right common femoral artery was punctured and a 6F appropriate vascular sheath was placed following our protocol for endovascular procedures. During the first attempt to catheterize the aortic arch for the standard pre-embolisation angiogram, an unusual dilatation of the thoracic descending aorta was noted, just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. The combination of these findings with the bruise in the upper left chest, made us suspicious of an aortic injury. The embolisation procedure was abandoned and an aortogram revealed an aortic dissection just distal to the left subclavian origin (). The patient was woken up and a chest CT followed, which confirmed the diagnosis of a post-traumatic dissection of the descending aorta. Subsequently, he was transferred to the cardio-thoracic unit and an aortic stent was successfully deployed for endovascular repair of the dissection (). He had an uneventful recovery and two weeks later, endovascular treatment of his Acom aneurysm was performed with platinum coils (). At the same time, a posttraumatic dissection aneurysm of the right common carotid artery (CCA) at its cervical segment was also found (). This was clinically silent, treated conservatively at that stage [] and the patient was eventually discharged three weeks after the primary event. At the six month follow-up, the patient had made a very good recovery and returned to full activities. The aortic dissection was not visible anymore in imaging but there was a recurrence of the previous coiled Acom aneurysm due to coil compaction. Thus, a new embolisation procedure with platinum coils was performed to treat this aneurysm recurrence. At the same stage, the right CCA dissection aneurysm was endovascularly treated using platinum coils, as it showed no signs of regression [,].","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 69-year-old male patient presented with stuporous mentality after fall from 2-meter height. On admission, the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 7/15. Neurological exam revealed no further abnormalities. Brain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an ICH in the left temporal lobe with diffuse SAH and subdural hemorrhage (). A brain CT angiography revealed a pseudoaneurysm of MMA (). Sequentially, the patient was submitted to cerebral angiography and the left external carotid angiogram revealed a pseudoaneurysm arisen from the anterior branch of the MMA accompanied by dAVF at the middle segment of sphenoid ridge (). Through the right common femoral artery, a guiding catheter (Envoy 6 Fr; Cordis/Johnson & Johnson, Miami, FL, USA) was positioned in the left external carotid artery. We carefully naviated a microcatheter pre-shaped 45 degrees (Excelsior SL-10; Stryker Neurovascular, Fremont, CA, USA) under the guidance of a 0.014-inch microguidewire (Synchro 14; Stryker Neurovascular) to reach the juxtaproximal to the pseudoaneurysm via MMA. After the confirmation of the appropriate position of the microcatheter via repetitive superselective angiography (), embolization of a pseudoaneurysm and MMA was performed using 25% n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) (Hystoacryl; B. Braun, Melsnagen, Germany) mixed with iodized oil (Lipiodol; Guerbet, Aulnay-sous-Boid, France). We achieved angiographically complete occlusion of a pseudoaneurysm and dural AVF (). Follow-up brain CT scan showed no significant hematoma enlargement and well penetrated glue cast at the all the vascular lesions ().
The patient presented an improvement in consciousness for GCS score 15 after 12 days. However, at the 18-day after the procedure, the right side weakness and dysarthria were developed. Brain CT angiography and subsequent left internal carotid angiography revealed cerebral vasospasm at the distal segment of MCA with multiple low densitied at the left MCA territories (). Cerebral vasospasm was treated using intra-arterial (IA) nimodipin infusion, and it was improved. At discharge, dysarthria was improved, but right side weakness was remained (Grade 3).","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 42-year-old man with no past significant medical illness presented with headache. CT scan done showed subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) predominantly in the perimesencephalic cisterns []. Magnetic resonance imaging T1 gradient sequence also showed the hypointense signal suggestive of blood products in the perimesencephalic cisterns []. Fetal posterior cerebral arteries are seen on both the sides arising from the internal carotid artery [Figures and ]. DSA (digital subtraction angiogram) done subsequently revealed fusiform bulbous dilation involving both the cisternal and cortical segments of the left SCA []. Endovascular treatment in the form of parent artery occlusion was done under general anesthesia, with complete exclusion of the aneurysm from the circulation as seen on post-coiling angiogram []. Standard heparin protocol was followed and activated clotting time greater than 250 s was maintained during the procedure. Six-French (6F) Envoy (cordis) guiding catheter was placed in the distal vertebral artery. A combination of echelon-10 microcatheter (ev3) and transcend 0.014 microwire (Stryker) were used to access the aneurysms. Multiple Axium (ev3) coils were used to occlude the aneurysm. There were no intra- and periprocedural complications and patient was discharged on the 5th day after operation. The post-operative course was uneventful. The patient's neurological examination after 1 month was completely normal.

"A 64-year-old man, who had a history of hypertension, presented with headache and vomiting. CT scan showed SAH in the superior cerebellar cisterns []. DSA done revealed a fusiform aneurysm of the distal SCA, predominantly involving the branch of the cortical segment [Figures and ]. Standard heparin protocol was followed and an activated clotting time greater than 250 s was maintained during the procedure. 5F Envoy (cordis) guiding catheter was inserted in the distal vertebral artery. The aneurysm was accessed with a combination of micro-catheter (echelon-10) and micro-wire (traxcess12). Meticulous pre-shaping of the micro-catheter according to the shape of the target aneurysm aided in proper positioning of the micro-catheter in the aneurysm which was subsequently packed densely with the platinum micro-coils. Post-procedure angiogram showed complete exclusion of the aneurysm along with the branch of the cortical segment and preservation of the flow in the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) []. There were no untoward events in the post-procedure hospital stay and patient was discharged after 1 week. No neurological deficit was seen during the clinical follow-up after 1 month.

"A three-year-old male child was admitted to the pediatric ward of Dr. Ruth KM Pfau, Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK) with a one-year history of generalized weakness, loose motions, decreased appetite and intermittent fever not associated with rigors, chills or night sweats, an eight-month history of inability to walk and sit, polydipsia, polyurea, abdominal distention and loss of neck holding for 14 days. He had a previous history of hospitalization six months ago due to the same complaints. The patient was accompanied by his mother. He weighed 6 kg, is the 7th born child to his parents and was delivered at term to a 37-year-old G7P7 mother via normal vaginal delivery. The mother did not report any complications or illnesses during pregnancy. He cried immediately after birth, and there were no complications during or after birth. There is no consanguinity between mother and father. The child was vaccinated but was malnourished, with an unremarkable family history.
The patient also developed diarrhea which was bulky in consistency, green in color with seven episodes per day after every meal intake. Diarrhea was associated with abdominal distention and vomiting. The mother then started giving him a combination of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, after which diarrhea subsided. The child developed neck holding at four years of age, he started sitting at eight months and started walking with support at 12 months of age. The child was first breastfed within three hours of delivery and was exclusively breastfed up to six months. Complimentary feeding was started after six months with pulses, mashed potatoes, porridge and chicken. Breastfeeding was continued up to two years. Currently, the child takes 1-2 feeds per day. The personal history revealed that the patient was sleeping normally, but the appetite was decreased. The mother also noticed a weight loss, altered bowel habits, and micturition was normal.
On examination (O/E), the patient was lying on the bed irritated, severely wasted and emaciated with visible bony deformities. Initial vitals included blood pressure (BP) 110/70 mmHg, a regular pulse of 90 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and a low-grade fever of 100° F. The patient was anemic and dehydrated, while, there was no presence of edema, clubbing, cyanosis, and lymphadenopathy. On further examination, parietal and frontal bossing, rachitic rosary (Figure ), widening of wrists and knock knees (it's a valgus deformity in which legs curve inwards so that the feet are apart when the knees are touching) were found as well. On abdominal examination, it was soft, non-tender, distended with mild tenderness on both flank regions, with a centrally placed umbilicus. The liver was palpable three fingers below the right costal margin. Gut sounds were audible 3-4 sounds/min. All other systems were unremarkable.
The anthropometric measures of the child are as follows: weight = 6.5 kg, occipitofrontal circumference = 49.5 cm, height = 72.5 cm, mid-upper arm circumference = 8 cm, upper segment = 45 cm, lower segment = 27.5 cm, weight for height = 6.5/9 *100 = 72.2 (moderately low) and height for age = 72.5/94.6*100 = 76.6 (severely low).
On investigations performed, complete blood count (CBC) showed a hemoglobin (Hb) of 5.4 gm/dl, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 82 fl and a platelet count of 187,000/mL. The total leukocyte count (TLC) was 10.6 x 109/L, including 39% neutrophils and 48% lymphocytes. His inflammatory markers were raised with a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 23 mg/L [Normal (N) = 3] and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 115 mm/hr (N = 0-22) for men and (N = 0-29) for women. The clotting profile showed an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.01, while prothrombin time (PT) was 10.6 seconds.
The urea creatinine electrolytes (UCE) were within normal range except decreased potassium levels of 2.8 mEq/L. The levels of calcium, magnesium and phosphate in blood were 15.1, 1.9 and 4 mg/dL, respectively. The blood culture showed a growth of Burkholderia species. The urinalysis showed a pH of 5.0, specific gravity of 1.025, with the presence of protein and blood. Additionally, numerous red cells were seen along with yeast and 4-6 pus cells per high power field (HPF). The urine culture showed growth of Candida species. The stool analysis showed that the stool was hard, acidic, brown in color with 1-2 pus cells per HPF. His vitamin D levels came out to be 54.29 ng/mL, and parathyroid levels were 8.36 pg/ml. Liver function tests showed a total bilirubin of 0.28 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 0.21 mg/dL and levels of alkaline phosphate alanine aminotransferase were 368 and 3 units per liter, respectively.
The X-rays of the chest (Figure ), skull (Figure ) and femur (Figure ) are attached below. Additionally, ultrasound of kidney ureters and bladder (KUB) showed an incidental finding of bilateral renal calculi (right kidney at lower pole measuring 0.7 cm, in the left kidney at mid pole measuring 0.7 cm), along with bilateral grade 2 renal parenchymal changes. The urinary bladder was normal in thickness with no presence of focal mass, calculus or diverticulum.
Considering the diagnosis of OI, an ophthalmology review was done to look for lens dislocation and blue sclera, but neither was present in both eyes. However, the left eye showed a corneal thinning nasally, temporally and inferiorly.
During the hospital stay, the patient was intravenously given cefotaxime 220 mg, piperacillin-tazobactam 700 mg, and meropenem three times a day. Additionally, linezolid 70 mg was injected every eight hours, along with injections of bisphosphonate 7 mg for three days, amikacin 55 mg twice a day for 14 days and fluconazole 85 mg loading dose, 45 mg once a day for 10 days. The patient was also given a teaspoon of the combination (artemether and lumefantrine) once a day. Three pints of red blood cells were transfused as well, after which his Hb became 10.6 mg/dL. During the stay, the child had a prolonged course of fever with pancytopenia, which improved on injections of meropenem, amikacin, and fluconazole.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 46-year-old male visited the emergency department of our hospital on April 23, 2015 due to fever and headache for three days and impaired memory for half a day. The patient had experienced fever three days before, with a peak body temperature of 38.5 °C. No other discomfort was described. He had visited other hospitals before and was diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection based on haematological findings. However, his condition did not improve after treatment with intravenous levofloxacin. Within a half a day, he developed impaired memory, concomitant with speech disturbance, poor response, no significant limb movements and convulsions before being referred to the emergency department of our hospital. The patient had no medical history. No histories of food and drug allergies were obtained. The patient denied any prior history of smoking, heavy drinking or drug abuse. On arrival, the initial physical examination revealed the following: body temperature 38.0 °C, pulse 100 beats/min, respirations 26 breaths/min, blood pressure 144/76 mmHg, delirium, speech disturbance, equal size and round shape of bilateral pupils with diameters of approximately 3.0 mm, sensitive to light reflex, basically normal cranial nerve examination, limb muscle strength Grade V, negative bilateral pathological signs, and no ataxia. The patient’s neck was soft, and there were no signs of meningeal irritation. No significant findings were found on the cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations. No skin rashes or bleeding sites were observed after examining the entire body. The laboratory test results were the following: haematology: white blood cells (WBC), 12.5 × 109/L, neutrophil percentage, 87.6%; C-reactive protein (CRP), 56 mg/L; procalcitonin (PCT), 2.8 ng/mL; and D-dimer, 3.2 μg/mL. A chemistry panel and screens for infectious diseases and cardiac markers were generally normal. No abnormal findings were observed on chest X-ray or electrocardiogram. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed a curved high-density mass at the left sylvian fissure area and an ischemic lesion of the left temporal lobe (Fig. ).
As an emergency diagnosis, massive cerebral infarction (probable atherosclerosis of the left internal carotid artery system) was considered, and intracranial infection could not be excluded; appropriate treatments included aspirin for anti-platelet aggregation, atorvastatin for lipid regulation and plaque stabilization, and cefuroxime and acyclovir for anti-infection.
The patient experienced aggravated unconsciousness after two hours of admission, and physical examination showed the following: lethargy, aphasia, equal size and round shape of bilateral pupils with diameters of approximately 3.0 mm, sensitive to light reflex, shallow right nasolabial folds, immobilization of right limbs upon orbital pressure, movable left limbs, positive right pathological signs and negative left pathological signs. Further revascularization therapy was considered, and the patient was immediately transferred to undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). On the way to the radiology department, the patient experienced further aggravation of unconsciousness and entered a light coma, concomitant with limb seizure, gazing to the left of bilateral eyes, equal size and round shape of bilateral pupils with diameters of approximately 2.0 mm, and disappearance of the light reflex. Appropriate treatments included midazolam for epilepsy, mannitol for dehydration and intracranial hypotension. After termination of the seizure, re-examination of the brain CT showed a curved high-density mass at the left sylvian fissure area and a massive low-density area in the left temporal lobe with many high-density plot areas scattered within it. CT images also showed compressed deformation of the left ventricle and a shift of the brain midline to the right (Fig. ). Considering that the patient developed haemorrhagic transformation, he was admitted to the emergency intensive care unit for further management.
Eighteen hours after admission, the patient experienced further aggravation of unconsciousness and entered a moderate coma, concomitant with high fever (body temperature 39.9 °C), bilateral pupils: left versus right = 5.0 mm versus 3.0 mm, respectively, disappearance of the light reflex, increased muscle tone of the right limbs, and positive pathological signs of bilateral limbs. The brain CT re-examination showed expansion of the bleeding area, with overt signs of brain herniation. The patient underwent emergency left frontal temporal craniotomy, removal of the intracranial hematoma and a decompressed craniotomy performed by neurosurgeons. The intraoperative findings were as follows: dark red appearance of the left temporal brain tissue, concomitant with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH); an ostomy of approximately 0.2 cm was created along the left temporal sulcus; a visible purple blood clot was observed, concomitant with surrounding contused brain tissues; and a large vascular embolization could be observed in the hematoma cavity. Approximately 10 mL of the hematoma and contused brain tissues were removed and sampled for pathological evaluation. Histopathological examination showed haemorrhage, oedema and inflammatory changes in brain tissues, neutrophil infiltration into the vascular walls and surrounding tissues, and microvascular purulent thrombosis (Figs. –). The patient was transferred to the neurologic intensive care unit for further treatment after the operation. During the course of the treatment, negative findings were found for Chlamydia pneumoniae, mycopsslasma, influenza, tuberculosis, the TORCH panel, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); the sputum culture was negative, and the blood culture suggested Staphylococcus aureus. No abnormal findings were found on chest X-ray or ultrasound. In addition, two transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) examinations were normal, and there were no observations of valvular dysfunction or neoplasm. The following final diagnosis was considered: massive cerebral infarction, consistent with haemorrhagic transformation (the left internal carotid artery system, inflammatory thrombus), Staphylococcus aureus sepsis and symptomatic epilepsy. After two months of vancomycin anti-infective treatments and supportive and symptomatic treatment, the consciousness of the patient improved gradually, and several blood cultures were negative. He underwent rehabilitation and was discharged from the hospital on the 72nd postoperative day (POD). At discharge, his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was E4V4M6, and the modified Rankin scale score was 3.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 60-year-old male experienced dimmed vision in his left eye for 3 days prior to his first visit. The patient negated any other symptoms, including pain and diplopia. He had a history of two previous occurrences of possible ON – 30 years ago in his left eye and some 10 years later in his right eye. The patient had a history of hypertension and was currently on antihypertensive drugs. No relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) was present at his first examination. BCVA was 0.65 in the right eye and 0.5 in his left eye. A fundus examination revealed an atrophic and excavated disc in his right eye. An optic disc edema was present in his left eye. Retina was normal in both eyes. Laboratory tests for sarcoidosis, syphilis, and giant cell arteritis were analyzed, including determination of HGB, blood count, serum calcium, ESR, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), and Wassermann reaction (WR). All tests were normal or negative. Visual field and color vision were analyzed 3 days later; visual field test showed arcuate inferior defects in both eyes, with equivalent neural capacity of 67% in his right eye and 58% in his left eye. A Sahlgren’s saturation test (SST) color vision test revealed a more defective color vision in his left (20) than in his right (15) eye.
An orbital MRI carried out 1 week later revealed increased signal intensity in the parts of the left optical nerve sheath, possibly indicating OPN. The MRI also showed increased signaling in the retrobulbar fat of the left eye. No increased swelling of the extraocular muscles was evident.
The patient received a course of prednisone, 60 mg/day, which was tapered over 1 month, at which time he was examined again. BCVA was 1.0 in the right eye and 0.65 in his left eye. The optic disc edema had subsided substantially since the last fundus examination 1 month earlier. He received a new course of prednisone, starting with 25 mg/day, which was tapered to 7.5 mg/day until his next visit 2 months later. His BCVA was 1.0 in his right eye and 0.65 in his left eye.
Visual field testing again showed arcuate inferior defects in both eyes and abnormal thresholds, with equivalent neural capacity of 69% in his right eye and 61% in his left eye. A new MRI showed a slight regression of the enhancement around the left optical nerve since the last MRI. The results of a fundus examination revealed a pale papilla in both eyes. He remained on 7.5 mg/day prednisone, which was tapered over 14 weeks.

"The proband (II-2 in Fig. ) is a 45-year old woman, who first presented to our university hospital at the age of 35 and was referred to us because of her pregnancy. She has congenital deafness, first experienced syncope at the age of 3, and was diagnosed with epilepsy. She was treated with anti-epilepsy medications; however, she subsequently experienced several instances of syncope. At the age of 13, she had a syncope event, and was suspected of having JLNS because of her congenital deafness and prolonged QT interval. Her syncope was diagnosed as an arrhythmic episode when she was aware of tachycardia and as epilepsy when she was not. She also had a subarachnoid hemorrhage at the age of 29.
When she first presented at our hospital, she was not taking beta-blockers, because of a history of asthma, but was taking mexiletine in addition to phenytoin. Her QTc was found to be prolonged (584 ms) at presentation and administration of atenolol was initiated. She delivered her baby (III-1 in Fig. ) through Caesarean operation at our hospital at the age of 35. At 37, she delivered her second baby (III-2 in Fig. ) through Caesarean operation at our hospital. Despite administration of beta-blockers, her QTc remained prolonged (600 msec at the age of 37, 780 msec at 44) (Figs. and ), which is not unexpected because treatment with beta-blockers in LQTS1 is not expected to overtly reduce QTc []. However, she continued to experience occasional syncope and finally underwent an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) operation at 38 years of age. Subsequently, she is in a stable clinical condition. Because the proband was suspected of JLNS and both infants had a measured QTc of 500 ms or greater within 1 month after birth, beta blockers were initiated and both children remain in stable condition at ages 10 and 8 (Figs. and ). QTc of the son (III-1 in Fig. ) was measured as 500 ms one month after birth, while the QTc of his sister (III-2) was 530 ms at birth.
The father (I-1) and mother (I-2) of the proband were first cousins. There is no history of sudden unexplained syncope or death of children or adults in the immediate family members, despite the prolonged QTc of the children.
Clinical evaluation and consultation of the proband and her family members were performed at Chiba University Hospital. Clinical phenotypes were deduced from the clinical history, physical examinations, and ECG. Blood samples were collected from the proband and her family members following genetic counseling, and written informed consent was obtained prior to sample collection.
Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes according to established protocols at our laboratory []. Entire coding exons, including the intronic boundaries of the genes, of KCNQ1 (NCBI ref: NM_000218) and other LQT causative genes (KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNJ2, SCN4B, KCNJ5) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), according to established protocols in our laboratory. Briefly, 30–100 ng of genomic DNA was subjected to PCR amplification with DNA polymerase (PrimeSTAR GXL DNA Polymerase; Takara Bio Inc., Kusatsu, Japan) and primer sets.
The amplicons were subjected to conventional sequencing with Sanger sequencers (Applied Biosystems 3730/3130 DNA analyzers; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The sequence data were processed with Gene Codes Sequencher Software (Takara Bio Inc.) and mapped to the human genome sequence (build GRCh37/hg19).
Genetic analysis was performed to screen all coding exons and the exon–intron boundaries of the KCNQ1 gene (NCBI ref: NM_000218.2, NP_000209.2) with concurrent screening of other LQT causative genes (KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNJ2, SCN4B, KCNJ5). We detected a novel homozygous nonsense variant, NM_000218.2:c.115G > T (p.Glu39X, in exon 1a), in the KCNQ1 gene of the proband, as well as a homozygous common variant (NM_000218.2:c.1343C > G, p.Pro448Arg) (Additional file : Table S1). Genetic screening of her mother (I-2) and children (III-1 and III-2) revealed that they were heterozygous for the nonsense variant (Fig. ). Her husband (II-3) was also screened and found to be heterozygous for the common variant (NM_000218.2:c.1343C > G, p.Pro448Arg). The proband is a child from a first-cousin marriage, and we have concluded the homozygous nonsense variant in the proband is the cause of her JLNS1. The proband was negative for pathogenic variants in other LQT causative genes, including the KCNE1 gene (Additional file : Table S1).","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"The patient was a 63-year-old man who met the DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. The onset of schizophrenia occurred in his early twenties. He had been treated with olanzapine (10 mg) for the last 4 years, but he had a tendency to stop the medication due to appetite and body weight. He was admitted to the hospital due to delusions and hallucinations at his older brother's funeral. Treatment with blonanserin (8 mg) and etizolam (1 mg, at night) was initiated for auditory hallucinations and delusions. At 2 weeks later, the patient complained of leg restlessness. His global score on the Barnes Akathisia Scale [] was 2. Substantial relief of akathisia was noted after 14 days of fluvoxamine (50 mg) treatment. His global score on the Barnes Akathisia Scale was 0.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 45-year-old Caucasian female born to first-cousin parents, with two healthy children and without any relevant family history record of prior diseases, was seen at the service of Dermatology (University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal) in March 2014 because of persistent extensive, skin-colored, exuberant, and disfiguring warts in both feet and hands since the age of 10 years (). Warts were refractory to treatment with keratolytic agents, cryosurgery, and excision, with minor improvement after treatment with acitretin in association with topical 50% urea cream. Apart from this, the patient did not describe recurrent infection-related episodes or diseases, except for past medical history of measles and mumps during her infancy and varicella infection during her first pregnancy, which all resolved without complications. Of note, such past history of infections is not rare among the patient age-matched Portuguese population since vaccination for these diseases was introduced in the Portuguese national vaccination program years after she was born (1969): in 1974 for measles, in 1987 for mumps, and in 2004 for varicella (–). In fact, outbreaks of measles and mumps have been reported in Portugal until the late 80s to mid-90s, with peaks of >10,000 cases per year (, ).
In addition, she referred allergic rhino-conjunctivitis treated with cetirizine and fluticasone, and chronic polyarthralgias in the absence of impaired functionality. Serological studies were negative for (severe) infections, including HIV 1/2, HTLV-1, and syphilis. In turn, she showed IgG antibodies for ubiquitous pathogens including CMV >250 arbitrary units (AU/ml) (positive threshold >6AU/ml) and Epstein–Barr virus VCA = 192 U/ml (positive threshold >20 U/ml) and EBNA = 24 U/ml (positive threshold >20 U/ml) in the absence of serum IgM antibodies for these pathogens (0.06 AU/ml; positive threshold >6AU/ml). Slightly increased serum IgG levels (IgG: 1,430 mg/dl), associated with normal IgA (278 mg/dl), IgM (67 mg/dl), C3 (1.4 g/L), C4 (0.33 g/L), and C1 inhibitor (0.318 g/L) serum levels, were detected. In addition, anti-neutrophil and anti–double-strand DNA autoantibodies were negative, while antinuclear autoantibodies were weakly positive. Screening for immunological alterations by flow cytometry () (–) using the EuroFlow Primary Immunodeficiency Orientation Tube (PIDOT) (, ) showed an absolute defect of CD4-expressing T-cells (<0.01 cells/μl), with normal total T-cell, CD8+ TCRγδ− T-cell, and NK-cell (absolute) numbers, associated with consistently increased B-cell counts vs. age-matched normal reference values. Importantly, (TCRαβ+ TCRγδ−) DN T-cells were significantly expanded (). Signs/symptoms associated with primary immunodeficiency other than persistent warts in the feet and hands were not observed either at presentation or during the subsequently 5-year follow-up period. Of note, peripheral blood (PB) monocytes and DCs showed no cell surface expression of CD4.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 45-year-old man, farmer by occupation, presented clinically with a slow growing, slightly tender, firm mass on the plantar aspect of left foot for 3 years, measuring 5×4×3 cm. There were multiple discharging sinuses covered with blood mixed purulent exudates. Radiograph showed features of osteomyelitis and soft tissue shadow. A tentative clinical diagnosis of tuberculous osteomyelitis was proposed. Imprint smears were made from the discharge and fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was done using a 23-gauge needle, attached to a 10-ml syringe. Aspirate consisted of sero-sanguinous, pus like material. Alcohol fixed smears were stained with Papanicolaou (Pap stain), while air-dried smears were stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa (MGG) stain. Simultaneously, Periodic acid Schiff (PAS), Gram’s stain and acid fast bacilli (AFB) stains were performed. Additionally, fungal and bacterial cultures were carried out.
Both FNAC smears and imprint smears comprised plenty of pus cells, some lymphocytes, histiocytes and foreign body giant cells in a necrotic background. Several brown to black colonies were seen. On higher magnification, these consisted of septate, branching fungal hyphae embedded in a cement-like matrix [Figures and ]. PAS stain highlighted the branching hyphae []. AFB and Gram’s stains were negative. The cytological diagnosis of eumycotic mycetoma was rendered with suggestion of Madura foot. The excised surgical specimen confirmed the diagnosis of eumycetoma. The fungal species was identified as Madurella mycetomatis on subsequent fungal culture.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 73-year-old man with multiple medical comorbidities including multiple myeloma after chemotherapy, diabetes, and coronary artery disease presented for the treatment of a comminuted right periprosthetic supracondylar distal femur fracture after sustaining a mechanical ground level fall (Figure ). Before this injury, he was able to ambulate two blocks without difficulty but did use a stair lift at home secondary to chronic left lower extremity weakness, which he attributed to his previous multiple myeloma treatment. He was medically optimized and taken to the operating room the following day for open reduction and internal fixation (Figure ). After achieving adequate reduction of the fracture through indirect reduction techniques, a limited lateral approach to the distal femur was performed and the proximal end of a titanium alloy NCB Periprosthetic Plate (Zimmer Biomet) was placed submuscularly. Three titanium alloy 5.0 mm standard screws were placed in a percutaneous manner proximal to the fracture and multiple titanium alloy 5.0 mm locked screws were placed in the distal segment. Postoperatively, he was placed in a knee immobilizer to be worn at all times for 3 weeks, at which time the range of motion exercises were initiated. He was limited to toe-touch weight bearing for 8 weeks. Before discharge, he was evaluated by our endocrinology team who obtained laboratory test results including comprehensive metabolic panel, vitamin D 25 hydroxy, and inorganic phosphate. Several of these laboratory values were found to be abnormal, and he was ultimately started on calcium and vitamin D supplements.
The patient was discharged to a skilled nursing facility on postoperative day 5. At his 8-week postoperative appointment, new radiographs were obtained (Figure ). Adequate callous formation was noted, and no concerns for complications were noted. At that time, he did have notable quadriceps atrophy but denied pain with passive or active range of motion. He was advanced to weight bearing as tolerated and given home quadriceps strengthening exercises.
At his 14-week postoperative appointment, it was noted that the patient had not been compliant with his home strengthening exercises, and he reported 75% weight bearing with continued use of a walker for all ambulation. He endorsed stiffness in his right knee and intermittent mild pain described as muscle soreness in his distal thigh. Radiographs were obtained, which demonstrated slight varus malalignment of the fracture and fretting of the distal-most screw placed proximal to the fracture site (Figure ). He was referred to physical therapy but was unfortunately lost to further follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 65-year-old female patient with staphylococcal native mitral valve infective endocarditis had a witnessed onset of right-sided hemiparesis and aphasia (NIHSS 18). The patient was initially admitted in a local hospital for infective endocarditis and treated with teicoplanin and gentamicin. The patient was brought to our emergency department 3 h and 45 min after she developed her stroke symptoms. Her past medical history included also liver cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and breast cancer. CT angiography showed an occlusion of both M2 divisional branches. Intravenous thrombolysis was contraindicated because of the evidence of endocarditis. Mechanical thrombectomy was considered due to the large vessel occlusion. Despite several attempts at aspiration, the clot remained in situ with the final angiography demonstrating a subtotal occlusion of both the M2 divisional branches (TICI 1). After 24 h, her NIHSS was 21 and the CT showed no haemorrhagic transformation. At neurological follow-up after 3 months, her mRS score was 4.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"On 21 May 2009, a 42-yr-old male patient visited our hospital because of malaise and jaundice. He had been working as an office manager of a trading company in China for two years. Two mild fever, and one month before examination, he felt unusual fatigue and jaundice. Twenty days before examination, he had been informed that his acute hepatitis was unusual because he had no hepatitis A, B, or C viral markers. He took herbal medication and received acupuncture in China under the diagnosis of acute hepatitis of unknown origin. His symptoms improved under herbal medication, but remained. He returned to Korea for treatment of the acute hepatitis. He had no other symptoms except for scanty whitish phlegm. He had been healthy until the recent illness. He was not currently on medication, was not an injecting drug abuser. He did not smoke nor drink alcohol. He had received no blood transfusion. He had been married for seven years, but had lived alone in China for two years. He was well oriented and his vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed icteric sclera and tender hepatomegaly. No mucous membrane lesions nor lymphadenopathy were present and he was afebrile. Cutaneous manifestations consisted of macular and papular lesions, about 0.5 cm in diameter, localized on the trunk, palms, and soles (). Genital examination revealed no lesions nor ulcers. Lymph nodes were not palpable in the neck, axillary, or inguinal areas. Laboratory tests showed the following: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 2,974 IU/L, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) 1,755 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 89 IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 119 IU/L, total bilirubin 8.3 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 6.9 mg/dL, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, albumin 2.4 g/dL, total protein 9.2 g/dL, white blood cell (WBC) 13,600/µL, hemoglobin 9.7 g/dL, platelets 752,000/µL, international normalized ratio (INR) 1.06, venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) was positive with a titer >1:1,024, and his fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) was reactive. A hepatitis panel including IgM anti-HAV, HBsAg, and anti-HCV, antinuclear antibody, ceruloplasmin, copper, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were all nonreactive. Computerized tomography didn't show any evidence of bile duct obstruction. It showed also mildly enlarged liver, nonspecifically enlarged lymph nodes at the porta hepatis area, and thickened gall bladder wall (). Chest radiography was normal.
Liver biopsy revealed portal-to-portal or portal to central zone bridge necrosis, and widening by lymphocyte infiltration, accompanied by intracanalicular and intracellular cholestasis. These findings were compatible with acute hepatitis (). A modified Warthin-Starry stain was negative for spirochetes. Skin biopsy revealed a perivascular mixed-cell infiltrate of prominent plasma cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes around a blood vessel that contained swollen endothelial cells ().
The patient was treated with weekly intramuscular benzathine penicillin, 2,400,000 U, for a total of three doses. One week after treatment, his fatigue and rash were markedly improved. Three weeks after treatment, ALP was 288 IU/L, total bilirubin was 0.3 mg/dL () and four weeks after treatment, the VDRL titer was down to 1:64. He did not develop a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. Positive serologic tests and a prompt response to penicillin treatment confirmed the diagnosis of syphilitic cholestatic hepatitis.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 46-year-old female smoker was admitted to the emergency department of our hospital due to cough with blood-tinged sputum for the last four days before admission. She did not complaint of any other symptom. Her past medical history was unremarkable. She denied any exposure to toxic substances and gave no history of handling dogs or having ever reared sheep. The physical examination revealed no specific findings and there was no sign of respiratory or cardiovascular dysfunction. Lung auscultation revealed a mild decrease in the intensity of breath sounds, whereas heart examination was completely normal, without extra sounds or murmurs. The electrocardiogram (ECG) was lacking remarkable findings. The patient had negative reaction of the Mantoux tuberculin skin test. Moreover, all routine laboratory test results, including liver and kidney function tests, serum proteins and urinanalysis were normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was normal (ESR 12 mm/hr). Sputum specimens for mycobacteria and other pathogens were smear and culture negative. Serological tests for cancer or virus were negative but serology for echinococcosis showed an indirect immunohemagglutination test positive. Other autoimmune markers were negative. Chest x-ray depicted multiple calcified cystic formations (Figure ). A Multi-Detector Computed Tomography (MDCT) of the chest [] and abdomen identified localized bronchiectatic lesions of the right upper lobe, calcified spots at both the lung fields, probably from previous disease (chickenpox, tuberculosis or occupational disease), a low density solitary lesion with peripheral calcification located at the myocardium of LV (compatible with calcified echinococcus cyst) (Figure ) and other three similar but smaller findings were located at the liver. The CT scan of the brain showed no disease. No lung disease was diagnosed with the bronchoscopy. Transthoracic contrast echocardiography revealed a cyst-like echoluscent structure 5 × 2 cm, occupying the Posterior Wall of Left Ventricle (PWLV). It gave the impression of endomyocardial localization due to the decreased thickness of the PWLV (Figure ). The rest of examination was normal with an estimated ejection fraction of 60%, without regional wall motion abnormalities. Coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries.
Excision of the cardiac cyst was planned by using cardiopulmonary bypass and the patient received perioperative chemotherapy with albendazol 10 mg/kg. After a median sternotomy the patient was connected to the cardiopulmonary bypass by cannulating the ascending aorta and right atrium. The pericardial cavity was free of adhesions. Under condition of normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass the aorta was crossclamped and the heart was arrested with a dose of antegrade cold blood-based cardioplegia. The heart was lifted and the free surface of the cyst was seen as a white tense mass in the lateral wall of left ventricle (Figure ). By palpation, it was partially calcified. The lateral wall of the left ventricle was localized by gauzes irrigated by 10% NaCl solution. A small incision was made into the cyst corresponding its free wall, and a viscous sub-yellow fluid was aspirated. The sub-epicardial wall of the cyst was then excised and its contents were completely aspirated (Figure ). The cyst was then injected, first with 10 ml of 10% NaCl solution and then with 5 ml of povidone iodine solution, which was left inside for 3 min and then aspirated. The resultant cavity was then obliterated by a continuous 4-0 prolene suture (Figure ). To complete this obliteration, we avoided to use any prosthetic material such as pledgets, to prevent possible postoperative infection. After de-clamping of the aorta and de-airing of the heart, the patient was easily weaned off bypass with no inotropic support. Cytology of the aspirated cyst fluid and histology of the cyst wall was consistent with the diagnosis of hydatid cyst (Figure ). The patient had an uneventful recovery and at the fifth postoperative day she discharged from the hospital with a normal echocardiographic examination which confirmed preserved function of the mitral valve apparatus, with only minimal regurgitation.
Follow up at 6 and 12 months, with echocardiography (Figure ) and CT scan, which confirmed the excellent post-surgery result without complications or recurrence of the disease. The findings of the liver were stable and brain CT was clear.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 65-year-old woman with a history of hyperlipidemia had experienced headache and vomiting for 10 days before admission to another hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed enlargement of both lateral ventricles and a mass at the foramen of Monro. The patient was then referred to our hospital.
Neurological examination on admission to our hospital showed memory disturbance (Mini-Mental State Examination 20/30) and a wide-based gait disturbance. Computed tomography (CT) showed a 16 mm mildly hyperdense mass with no calcification at the foramen of Monro, and the mass was causing obstructive hydrocephalus. MRI revealed a well-delineated mass at the foramen of Monro with heterogeneous signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images; the mixed-signal core appeared as a popcorn-like lesion typical of cavernous angioma (Fig. ). Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted imaging revealed mild enhancement of the mass (Fig. ). There were no vascular abnormalities on CT angiography or CT venography. We considered a colloid cyst, central neurocytoma, subependymoma, ependymoma, low grade astrocytoma, and arteriovenous malformation as differential diagnosis; however, despite the unusual location of the mass, a diagnosis of intraventricular cavernous angioma was made because of its typical appearance on MRI.
We performed endoscope-assisted transcortical removal of the mass (Fig. ). The entry point was made using the StealthStation S7 navigation system (Medtronic Inc., Louisville, CO), and a flexible videoscope (VEF-V, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted. Intraoperative neuroendoscopic imaging revealed a reddish lobular mass with a hematoma and obstruction of the foramen of Monro. We observed the cavum septum pellucidum because of the high intracranial pressure associated with hydrocephalus. After right frontal mini-craniotomy, the Viewsite Brain Access System (Vycor Medical Inc., Boca Raton, FL) was inserted (Raza et al. ); we used the 17 mm wide retractor in the 7 cm length. Endoscope-assisted surgery with the Viewsite was performed with technique similar to microsurgery. A 2.7 mm rigid endoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) fixed by UniArm (Mitaka Kohki, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted. The working ambience was air because of its advantages over fluid ambience especially when dealing with a relatively vascularized pathology. Other microsurgical instruments were used parallel to the endoscope. The endoscope served only as an optic apparatus. We used the Viewsite as an access port to enable dual instrumentation (endoscope and microsurgical instrumentation). The tumor was bluntly dissected from the ventricle wall, and total en bloc resection of the lesion was performed by one surgeon using the two-handed technique. Bleeding was well controlled with irrigation and bipolar coagulation.
The resected tumor was reddish and consisted mainly of clotted blood vessels and xanthochromic tissue. Histological examination revealed a cavernous angioma with evidence of large vascular spaces filled with an organized thrombus (Fig. ).
Postoperative MRI confirmed complete removal of the tumor, and a return to normal ventricular size (Fig. ). The patient’s symptoms resolved immediately, and there were no postoperative complications. She was discharged without any neurological deficit. No complications or neurological impairment were observed at the 1-year follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

A temporal biopsy was negative. However, his symptoms responded well to treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg) with normalization of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and methotrexate for a total duration of 4 years.

"The patient was a 24-year-old male with a past psychiatric history of schizophrenia who was seen in the outpatient clinic due to hypersexuality after starting aripiprazole. The patient had no known health problems. He had no history of head trauma, seizures, sexually transmitted disease, or significant substance abuse problems. He was first diagnosed with schizophrenia at the age of 19 years and was started on olanzapine, which he responded well to for years. The patient was living with his mother and had completed 11th grade level education. He did not have any history of developmental or intellectual difficulties. He was working part time in a fast food restaurant when he started to have the decline. He was single, never married, and had no significant other. The patient did not have very many acquaintances and led a quiet life. He has no known legal issues so far. The patient used cannabis occasionally when he was 17, but denied any use now. He did not have any problems with alcohol and or other illicit substances. He did not have any history of tobacco use. There was no known family history of mental illness.
The patient was previously stable on olanzapine 20 mg/day for four years and then became noncompliant due to unclear reasons, leading to worsening of psychotic symptoms. He was switched to oral aripiprazole 15 mg/day with a plan to switch to a long-acting injectable due to possible nonadherence. During the initial oral one-week trial, the patient became increasingly unstable, with physical and verbal altercations with his mother. The patient also ran away from home and lost his job due to public masturbation at his workplace. His mother also noticed that the patient was increasingly flirtatious and inappropriate in public with females, which were behaviors he had never displayed previously. Given his worsening behaviors, the patient was admitted to the inpatient unit and was switched to intramuscular injection (IM) of aripiprazole 400 mg, assuming that he would benefit from a long-acting injectable and that he could be non-adherent with the oral medication. He became increasingly sexually aroused and was acting inappropriate in the days following. During the hospital stay, there was an instance where he had sex with a female peer and had to be placed on 1 : 1 observation, i.e., one staff was assigned to continuously observe the patient. After discharge from the hospital, the patient needed constant reminders in his group home to keep his hands out of his pants. Despite these attempts to reduce the inappropriate behavior, the patient endorsed that his sexual arousal was more than normal after starting the aripiprazole. At this point in time, the patient had received two doses of aripiprazole 400 mg IM. While on aripiprazole, he did not show any gambling urges and or other impulsivity other than the sexual preoccupations. The sexual preoccupations started within a week of starting with aripiprazole. Further aripiprazole injections were discontinued, and the patient was again prescribed olanzapine 20 mg/day given his previous good response. In the group home, the patient continued to remain occasionally agitated with outbursts and required constant redirection about appropriate sexual behaviors in public. He also continued to display sexually inappropriate behaviors towards females in a day program and was banned from attending the program until he was able to behave appropriately. Although he had reduction in the intense sexual behaviors four weeks after stopping the aripiprazole injections, he did not completely return to baseline. Given his ongoing sexually inappropriateness and possible reports of being internally stimulated, he was started on paliperidone 6 mg/day for augmentation and with plan to taper and stop olanzapine. The patient started to have fewer outbursts and was noted to be in much better mood after three to four weeks of starting the paliperidone. He was noted to be less sexually preoccupied and with reduction in inappropriate behaviors in public. When writing this report, the patient was on both olanzapine 20 mg/day and paliperidone 6 mg/day, with the goal of attaining paliperidone monotherapy, initially oral and subsequently long-acting injections. The patient continued to live in the group home to learn social skills before moving into independent housing. After 12 weeks of paliperidone use, the patient was completely free from hypersexual thoughts and behaviors.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 78-year-old woman was referred to our clinic with bilateral hearing loss with sound distortion, tinnitus and auditory hypersensitivity, recurrent vertigo/dizziness induced by loud noises (Tullio phenomenon), and a diagnosis of bilateral SSCD at the temporal bone HRCT performed in the emergency room (Figures 2a–c).
Preoperative audiometry indicated severe mixed hearing loss in the right ear, with moderate conductive hearing impairment in the left ear (). A pure tone sound of 110 dB at 500 and 1,000 Hz in the right ear, and pneumatically increasing external auditory canal pressure induced dizziness without detectable nystagmus on video-oculographic (or Frenzel goggles) examination. Her tympanogram was bilaterally normal. A stapedial reflex could not be performed due to patient intolerance (dizziness). Mastoid vibration elicited dizziness without detectable nystagmus on video-oculographic (or Frenzel goggles) examination. A temporal bone 1.5-T MRI with 3D reconstruction performed two months before did not show the bilateral dehiscence (). Air conduction cervical VEMPs (cVEMPs) demonstrated a threshold of 85 dB HL on the right side and 100 dB HL on the left side. The cVEMPs were recorded from both ears using 500 Hz short tone-bursts (STBs). A video head impulse test for horizontal and vertical canals, including both dehiscent SSC, showed normal vestibulo-ocular reflex gain bilaterally ().
Possible surgical procedures (superior canal plugging or resurfacing either through a middle fossa approach or via a transmastoid route, or RW niche plugging) were discussed with the patient. Comorbid cardiopulmonary conditions represented major contraindications for general anesthesia, so the latter procedure was the only possible option to pursue.
Since the patient did not show bilaterally any benefit from an air conduction hearing aid but rather had deteriorating auditory and vestibular symptoms on the right, we decided to perform the surgical procedure in the right ear as it had worse vestibular and auditory symptoms, a poorer hearing threshold, and greatly altered HRCT and VEMPs findings.
With local-assisted anesthesia, we performed a transcanal approach with elevation of the tympanomeatal flap and preservation of the chorda tympani nerve with a minimally invasive retroauricular incision. Ossicular mobility and continuity were assessed, we excluded the stapedial fixation, and no cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak was observed during the surgical procedure. After identification and reshaping of the RW niche, a vibroplasty was performed paying particular attention to correctly plugging the round window and coupling it with the floating mass transducer (FMT) of the VSB (). We opted to couple the FMT with the RW because concomitant RW plugging was performed and from previous studies it seemed to provide a more stable coupling over time than incus (). No ossicular chain abnormalities or perilymphatic fistula were observed intraoperatively.
The plugging of the round window was achieved using cartilage and perichondrium (tragus). This autologous tissue also helped to seal off the FMT in the round window niche. Furthermore, VSB hearing outcomes were monitored with electrocochleography using a cotton-wick recording electrode placed on the hypotympanum () ().
The wire of the VSB was housed in a canal tunnel drilled up to the tympanic attic. Minimal drilling of the cortical temporal bone posterosuperior to the external auditory meatus was necessary to house the implant receiver and extra wire (). The ear canal tunnel was covered with autologous cartilage and external auditory meatus packing was performed.
This study received an exemption from the ethics committee of the University Hospital of Siena (Comitato Etico Regione Toscana, area vasta Sud Est–AOU Senese, Usl Toscana Sud Est) on 10/21/2019 for publication.
Surgery was uncomplicated, the patient did not complain of any post-operative vestibular symptoms. Sutures and external meatus packing were removed on the 10th postoperative day. At the 1-month follow-up, the patient underwent VSB activation and hearing and vestibular examination. She reported a significant improvement in auditory hypersensitivity and reduced sound distortion although tinnitus remained unchanged. No disabling vestibular symptoms were reported. Neither dizziness nor nystagmus could be observed in response to loud sounds or increased external ear pressure on the right side. The postoperative pure tone audiogram revealed a mild increase at 500, 1,000, and 2,000 Hz and a mild decrease at 250 and 4,000 Hz for bone conduction thresholds (). An improvement to moderate hearing loss in the VSB-aided hearing threshold was confirmed at 3 months (). The maximum speech recognition score of bysillabic words at 65 dB HL improved from 10% preoperatively to 70% at the last follow-up. The improvement of hearing and vestibular symptoms was confirmed subjectively by the patient on the right side. Discomfort and mild dizziness associated with loud sounds on the left side remained unchanged. Using a visual analog scale (0–10), the patient reported an improvement in symptoms from 10 to 4 and from 9 to 2, respectively, for hearing and vestibular complaints (3-month follow-up). Left side mild symptoms related to dehiscence remained unchanged. No short-term surgical complications such as device extrusion or external or middle ear canal infection/inflammation were identified at the 3-month follow-up (). Control HRCT was not performed since correct positioning of the FMT and plugging of the RW were confirmed by improvements in symptoms and stability of VSB-aided hearing. Air conduction VEMPs were not performed for safety reasons due to the risk of mobilizing the plugging or FMT from the RW.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 75-year-old man was referred to our institution after being diagnosed incidentally with a 3.0 cm, solid, right renal mass on computed tomography (CT) performed to assess thoracic trauma. He had no specific symptoms. The results of laboratory investigations were within normal limits. On abdominal CT, a renal mass was identified in the upper portion of the right kidney (). The mass measuring approximately 3.0 cm × 2.0 cm was well defined, and it consisted of a partial cystic mass within a mainly solid renal mass. The cystic component contained calcifications. No definite hydronephrosis or caliectasis was detected. The patient had no other abnormal findings, such as suspected distant metastasis or lymph node metastasis. At that time, we considered cystic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), oncocytoma, and adult-type cystic nephroma as the differential diagnosis of this mixed cystic and solid renal tumor. In May 2012, we planned an open partial right nephrectomy; however, during the operation, we noticed that the tumor had invaded the renal capsule. Therefore, we performed open right nephrectomy. After histopathological evaluation, the lesion was diagnosed as a primary renal carcinoid tumor (neuroendocrine tumor). The tumor met both the histological and immunochemical criteria for designation as a carcinoid tumor. Grossly, the resected tumor included a white-yellow soft mass attached to a cystic lesion (). On microscopic examination, the tumor consisted of a ribbon-like, trabecular, or rosette like pattern of cells with a high nucleus: cytoplasm ratio (). Immunohistologically, the tumor cells were positive for antibodies for the neuroendocrine markers, chromogranin A (), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) (), and somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2) (). The tumor cells had a mitotic count of 4 mitoses/10 high-power fields and the level of proliferation marker Ki-67 was 5%. The microscopic and immunohistological findings were compatible with the diagnosis of a primary renal neuroendocrine tumor (grade 2). No local recurrence or systemic metastasis was detected during the 18-month follow-up period.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 55-year old male presented to an academic medical center in February 2020 with a six-week history of increasing midline back pain. He had a history of chronic mid- and lower back pain as the result of degenerative disc disease, however his pain had abruptly worsened in the 6 weeks prior to presentation. Pain was worsened with trying to sit up straight or walk. Pain was partially relieved with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and oxycodone 5 mg tablets taken as needed. He reported no associated fevers, chills, or night sweats. He did not recall a febrile illness prior to the onset of symptoms. He did report anorexia and 15-pound weight loss in the last 6 weeks. His medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic hepatitis C infection, hyperlipidemia, generalized anxiety disorder, and lumbar degenerative disc disease. His surgical history was notable for cervical spine laminectomy in the remote past. His social history was notable for heavy and ongoing tobacco use with a 60 pack-year smoking history. He denied alcohol or illicit drug use including intravenous drug use.
He was afebrile and hemodynamically stable on presentation. Physical exam revealed a gaunt Caucasian male in moderate distress due to pain. Poor dentition was noted. His cardiopulmonary examination was unremarkable. On spinal examination, no bony tenderness was elicited upon palpation of the thoracic and lumbar spine, however paraspinal tenderness was noted in the lumbar spine. Neurologic examination including strength and sensation of the lower extremities was intact. Babinski reflex was downward bilaterally.
MRI with and without gadolinium contrast revealed abnormal enhancement of the lower endplate of the L2 vertebral body as well as diffuse enhancement of the L3 vertebral body with irregularity of the upper endplate. This abnormal enhancement extended to the intervertebral disc. Findings were suggestive of discitis with osteomyelitis not excluded. Additionally, there was enhancement and thickening in the anterior epidural space measuring 2 mm × 4 mm which may represent epidural abscess or hematoma (Fig. ). Laboratory evaluation including CBC with differential and comprehensive metabolic panel was unremarkable. Sedimentation rate was 36 mm/hr. and C-reactive protein was 30.1 mg/L. Blood cultures were sterile.
Based on initial results of clinical, laboratory, and radiographic evaluation, antibiotic therapy was withheld. CT-guided aspiration of the L2-L3 disc was performed for culture and histopathology. Gram stain revealed Gram variable rods. Histopathology revealed fibrocartilage with degenerative changes and acute inflammation suggestive of discitis (Fig. ). He was seen in Infectious Diseases outpatient consultation, initially offered intravenous antibiotic therapy however patient requested oral antibiotic therapy for empiric treatment of discitis. He was started on treatment with cephalexin 1 g by mouth three times a day as well as linezolid 600 mg by mouth twice a day. (Initially, prior to the revelation of RBF infection, linezolid was chosen (in addition to cephalexin) because Gram stain revealed Gram-positive rods. The intention was to cover Corynebacterium spp. and coagulase-negative staphylococci, skin flora which tend to have resistance to beta-lactams but susceptibility to vancomycin or linezolid.) Cultures were sent to a reference laboratory, with growth noted on Mueller-Hinton media with 5% sheep blood. The organism was identified as Streptobacillus moniliformis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF). On further history, it was revealed that patient had two pet rats and had sustained numerous bites in the last 1 year prior to symptom onset. In vitro susceptibility testing using broth microdilution revealed low MIC for penicillin (< 0.06 μg/ml), ampicillin (< 0.12 μg/ml), and ceftriaxone (< 0.06 μg/ml), with elevated MIC > 4 μg/mL for gentamicin. The patient’s symptoms dramatically improved with cephalexin so a decision was made not to switch to oral or IV penicillin. Linezolid was discontinued after 2 weeks once culture results were available. He completed 6 weeks of oral cephalexin therapy with dramatic improvement of back pain. The patient was offered TEE to evaluate for endocarditis. However, he declined to have the test done as this coincided with the onset of CoVID-19 pandemic.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 72-year-old Asian male was consulted to our hospital with sudden scrotal swelling but no additional symptoms. His past history included low risk CLL in revised Rai stage 0 without any treatment 16 years ago. On physical examination, his left scrotum was slightly swollen, whereas his right scrotum had marked swelling and a detectable hard mass. Blood examination showed high levels of white blood cell (27 840 μL: normal range 3300–8600) and LDH (341 U/L: normal range 124–222); however, other abnormalities including for the testicular tumor markers, serum alpha fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotropin, were not evident. Enhanced CT showed a round, bilateral testicular tumors (right side 72 × 58 mm and left side 22 × 18 mm) with homogeneous iso-enhancement relative to normal testis, and 8-mm–sized para-aortic masses. These masses were slightly and gradually enhanced in dynamic contrast-enhanced CT without any suspicious lesions of visceral metastases noted except the surrounding lesions of the para-aorta (Fig. a,b). MRI revealed a low intensity on T2-weighted images compared to those of normal testis and a low intensity on an apparent diffusion coefficients map (Fig. c,d). The clinical diagnosis was bilateral testicular tumors including malignant lymphoma, and after informed consent, an immediate bilateral orchiectomy was performed. The tumor was solitary, and rounded shape, with the cut surface of that showing a yellowish color (Fig. a). Pathological finding revealed that the tumor consisted of blastemal cells, each with an atypical small round shape, and scant cytoplasm. These cells morphologically composed of confluent sheets of large neoplastic B lymphocytes resembling either centroblasts or immunoblasts (Figs b,c,a). The tumor lesion of large neoplastic B lymphocytes was immunoreactive for CD20 (Fig. b), and negative for CD5 (Fig. c), CD3 (Fig. d), and CD23 (Fig. e). Atypical small round cells around large neoplastic B lymphocytes were immunoreactive for CD20, CD5, CD23, and Bcl2 (Fig. f), and negative for CD3. These histopathological findings were consistent with a DLBCL variant, a transformation of CLL, with the final diagnosis being RS. PET–CT revealed the presence of positive lesions in the nasal septum, a tiny subcutaneous tumor in front of the left chest, and bilateral adrenal glands that could not be detected on CT (Fig. e–h). Therefore, the patient immediately underwent an induction combination of rituximab with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone immunochemotherapy, and the intrathecal administration of chemotherapeutic agents, including methotrexate, cytarabine, and prednisone. After four cycles of the regimen, the patient showed a complete response in an imaging study. Totally, eight cycles of chemotherapy was performed, and the patient was monitored on an outpatient basis. He was successfully in remission for 14 months after the end of immunochemotherapy.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 56-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure developed a gradual decrease in vision in her left eye over a 2-month period prior to her first examination. Two weeks prior to her first visit, she developed left eye pain, radiating upward. She negated headaches, diplopia, or problems with her right eye. She was currently on insulin, antihypertensive medication, and aspirin. The results of the first ophthalmologic examination revealed optic disc edema and RAPD in the left eye. Visual acuity was 0.8 in the right eye and 0.13 in the left eye.
Initial laboratory testing included syphilis serology, Lyme disease (Borrelia antibodies), determination of HGB, electrolyte status, ACE, blood count, CRP, and ESR. The results of all the tests were negative or normal except Lyme disease serology (IgG 239 (pos), IgM 9 (neg)), low ACE (2 U/L), and eosinophilic cells (high).
An MRI performed 1 week later revealed enlargement and enhancement in the left nerve sheath from the eye to the chiasma, in line with the findings seen in OPN ( and ).
At a new consultation 1 month after her first visit, BCVA was unchanged. A visual field test revealed a general constriction of the visual field of the left eye, with equivalent neural capacity of 99% in his right eye and 33% in his left eye. Fundus examination showed progression of the left optic disc edema (). RAPD was still present. New laboratory tests that included ESR, CRP, ACE, and sarcoidosis revealed nothing abnormal.
One month later, 2 months after her first examination, the left optic disc edema had regressed but an RAPD was still present. Visual acuity was unchanged since her last visit. Treatment with prednisone was initiated, 60 mg/day, which was tapered to 25 mg/day over 4 weeks when she was examined again.
At a fourth consultation, 3 months after her first visit, visual acuity was 0.8 in both eyes. A SST color vision test revealed that the patient had more defective color vision in her left eye (35 p), compared to the right (15 p). The optic disc edema was reduced. The steroid dose was tapered to 5 mg/day during 3 weeks. At this point, the patient suffered her first relapse with dimmed vision in her left eye. Fundus examination 1 week later revealed a pale papilla. BCVA was now 0.8 in her right eye and 0.4 in her left eye. Steroid dose was increased to 30 mg/day and tapered to 20 mg/day until the next appointment 2 weeks later. Some days later, the patient was hospitalized with arrhythmia due to hypercalcemia and hyperkalemia. At the new consultation, visual acuity was 0.8 in her right eye and 0.5 in her left eye.
The steroid dose was lowered with 2.5 mg per week. At 10 mg/day, she suffered a second relapse and received intravenous steroids. Her corticosteroid dose was increased to 30 mg/day in addition to azathioprine (150 mg/day). A fundus examination 3 months later revealed a normal optic disc with no edema. One month later, the steroid dose had been tapered to 17.5 mg/day. BCVA was 0.8 in both eyes. An SST color vision test revealed defective color vision in both the right (30 p) and the left eye (40 p). The fundus examination showed no sign of optic disc edema.
Four months later, it was suspected that the patient was suffering from sarcoidosis. Liver and spleen biopsies were positive for granulomas.
Four months later, she had a third relapse. She was taking 150 mg azathioprine and no corticosteroids at this time. Both eyes were affected; BCVA was 0.4 in her left eye and 0.65 in her right eye. A fundus examination revealed blurred borders of the optic discs in both eyes.
At a new consultation 2 months later, she remained on azathioprine, 150 mg/day, and was taken off corticosteroids. BCVA was 0.5 in her right eye and 0.65 in her left eye. Fundus examination showed no optic disc edema. A new MRI added support to the OPN diagnosis.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"We present a case of a 62-year-old male with 42-year history of small intestinal CD diagnosed at the age of 20, requiring two small bowel resection surgeries during this course of time. Our patient was solely on prednisone therapy for an extended period of time and switched to AZA (150 mg daily) for the last 21 years with relatively well controlled symptoms. During routine follow-up screening tests, he was incidentally found to have left lobe liver mass and was diagnosed with HCC for which he received left lobe hepatectomy at the age of 58. The AZA dose was reduced to 50 mg daily.
On subsequent follow-up, four years after the initial resection, he was found to have liver mass and was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. On presentation to hospital, the patient appeared well without any evidence of jaundice or stigmata of chronic liver disease. Preoperative blood work including liver profile and viral hepatitis markers was entirely normal: AST 18 U/L (<37 U/L), ALT 16 (<60 U/L), albumin 3.5 g/dL (3.5–5 g/dL), bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL (0.3–1.2 mg/dL), and INR 1.0, alpha-fetoprotein 10.3 ng/mL (<6.1 ng/mL), prothrombin time 13.3 seconds, and platelet count 210/μL.
Triple phase contrast enhanced CT of abdomen showed solitary mass in the segment 5 of the right lobe measuring 2.2 × 1.6 × 2.1 cm, with arterial enhancement and early wash out in the venous phase, and no evidence of lymphadenopathy or extrahepatic metastasis (Figures and ).
The decision toward surgical excision of the tumor was made. Patient underwent laparoscopic resection of segment 5 with no postoperative complications. Microscopically, the resected mass showed moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma without evidence of microvascular invasion ().
There was no postoperative adverse events and AZA was discontinued and patient was kept on oral budesonide.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"Patient III was a 70-year-old man who experienced right shoulder pain for >3 months with no history of trauma. There was no noticeable improvement following intra-articular corticosteroid injection 1 month before. Subjective pain on the VAS was 5 at rest and 8 during motion. On physical examination, the empty-can test was positive. US demonstrated substantial effusion of the long biceps tendon and SASD bursa with a full-thickness tear of the supraspinatus and subscapularis tendon (Fig. C). MRI revealed a full-thickness tear along the supraspinatus and subscapularis tendon with SASD bursitis. With US guidance, 9 mL of clear bursal fluid was aspirated, and a triamcinolone mixture was injected. All laboratory results, including bursal fluid levels were within normal limits. At 1 month, his pain score on the VAS decreased from 5 to 3 at rest and from 8 to 4 during motion; follow-up US revealed diminution of the previously noted bursal distension (Fig. D). His pain scores at 2 months were approximately at the same level as that at 1 month; follow-up US revealed increased bursal distension compared to the previous US finding but fluid accumulation was slightly decreased compared to the initial US finding (Fig. E).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A proband, female, aged 10 years and 3 months, with a medical history of recurrent fever and abdominal distention prior to the age of 5 years and 9 months, was admitted to our hospital with recurrent fever and cough for 3 days. Five years and nine months before admission to our hospital (when the child patient was 4 years and 6 months old), she was diagnosed with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)–HLH due to fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, increase of ferritins and positive EBV-DNA, and thus was treated based on the HLH-2004 plan for 8 weeks. Treatment was then stopped, and the disease remained in continuous remission for 22 months. Three years and nine months before admission to our hospital, the patient was diagnosed as having a relapse of EBV–HLH due to the aforesaid symptoms and her positive blood EBV–DNA, and she was treated again by chemotherapy based on the HLH-2004 plan for 8 weeks. Symptoms relieved and she stopped taking drugs, and the duration of the disease remission reached about 19 months. Two years before admission to our hospital, the child patient developed recurrent fever and abdominal distension, which improved after receiving anti-infective therapy and taking dexamethasone (details not known) in a local clinic. She denied having a history of infectious disease and has been inoculated with hepatitis B vaccine, BCG vaccine, poliomyelitis attenuated live vaccine, diphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccine, measles attenuated live vaccine, and epidemic encephalitis B vaccine, without any abnormal reaction. The patient was born in full term, G3P3, her parents’ marriage was consanguineous (Fig. ), and the two elder brothers respectively developed recurrent fever and abdominal distension symptoms similar to the patient's at the ages of 4 and 5 years and died of treatment failure in another hospital. Specific diagnosis and treatment as well as causes of death were unknown. After admission to our hospital, the child patient had a continuous high fever (39–40 °C), with an acute serious sickly appearance, without stained yellow skin or rash, but scattered ecchymosis was found. The superficial lymph nodes were not affected but her tonsils were slightly swollen. Medium and fine moist rales were heard in her right lung. Her abdomen was distended, the liver was 3.0 and 5.0 cm below the costal margin and the xiphoid, respectively. No abnormity was found in her nervous system. The hemogram revealed pancytopenia with the neutrophils 0.29 × 109/L, Hb 52 g/L, and platelets 6 × 109/L, respectively. The fibrinogen was decreased (the lowest value was 44 mg/dL), and the ferritin was elevated (995.3 ng/mL). Her triglyceride was normal, and a hemophagocytic phenomenon was found in a bone marrow examination. Multiple etiological examinations (blood culture, fungus G test and GM test, mycobacterium tuberculosis T-SPOT, mycoplasma, chlamydia and EBV-DNA [six repeated examinations], cytomegalovirus [CMV]-DNA, TORCH and seven combined examinations of respiratory viruses) were negative. According to eight HLH clinical diagnosis standards formulated by the International Histiocyte Society in 2004, the patient was clinically diagnosed as HLH. Due to a positive family history, in order to further specify the causes of the disease, we examined the activity of NK cells, the CD107a degranulation function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells, as well as hereditary HLH-related gene mutations, and found that:
the activity of NK cells in the proband was reduced slightly, the CD107a degranulation function in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells also was obviously declined, and her parents also presented with reduced NK cell activity and slightly declined CD107a degranulation in CTL and NK cells (Fig. );
a homozygous mutation in STX11 (c.49C>T), which converted the codon encoding the glutamine amino acid at position 17 in syntaxin11 to a termination codon (p.Q17X), leading to early termination of the synthesis of syntaxin11 and loss of 240 amino acids (Fig. ).
This mutation was inherited from the parents of the proband (Figs. and ), and the result proved that the proband suffered from FHL-4. After admission to our hospital, the patient found relief after receiving treatment based on the HLH-2004 protocol; she has been alive for 6 years and 10 months since the onset, has stopped taking the dexamethasone and etoposide, but still takes cyclosporine orally to maintain treatment. She has undergone HLA matching and now is actively looking for a donor to undergo a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 53-year-old male patient presented with scrotal erythema of 2 months duration. He had a previous diagnosis in another institution of contact dermatitis in the area. He had employed topical hydrocortisone and other non-specified topical treatments for 2 months. He referred erythema, a burning sensation, and pain in the scrotum. Clinical examination revealed bright-red erythema in the scrotum. No clinical signs or suggestive symptoms of contact dermatitis were noted. The patient had suspended topical treatment 2 months before evaluation. Because of the low-suspicion of contact dermatitis, patch test was considered not appropriate at the time.

"A 66-year-old lady presented to the general surgeons with a history of diarrhoea and abdominal distension. Examination revealed ascites and a CT scan was organised; this showed gross ascites with small pleural effusions, bulky ovaries, a fibroid uterus, and multiple peritoneal and mesenteric deposits. Tumour makers were within normal limits with Ca 125 17, CEA 2.1, and Ca19 9 6.2. A gynaecological oncology opinion was sought and an ascitic drain sited for symptom relief and to obtain possible cytological diagnosis. Histological analysis of ascitic fluid on two separate occasions revealed leukocytes, mesothelial cells, and scattered histiocytes with no malignant cells present. Further immunohistochemistry was performed confirming the cells to be lymphoid in origin.
She continued to be symptomatic with abdominal distension and vomiting and therefore, a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed by the general surgeons. Laparoscopy confirmed gross ascites with what appeared to be widespread carcinomatosis with peritoneal and omental seedlings, bulky uterus and ovaries. Omental biopsies that were taken revealed an inflammatory process suggestive of possible sclerosing peritonitis. Histology showed omental fat with fibrous proliferation at the surface infiltrated by inflammatory cells and nodules of mesothelial proliferation, with no evidence of neoplastic infiltration. Immunohistochemical analysis was negative.
Her clinical condition remained unchanged, and she required further ascitic drains for symptom relief. An MRI scan confirmed CT findings, and her case was discussed in detail at the Gynaecology and Colorectal MDT.
As extensive investigation failed to establish a definitive diagnosis. In view of the small possibility of the fibroid uterus being responsible for her condition the decision was taken to perform a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral Salpingo-ophrectomy, omental biopsy, and serosal bowel biopsy. The gynaecological procedure was completed without difficulty with note only of an enlarged fibroid uterus. The peritoneal cavity was generally fibrosed extending throughout the bowel surface. Macroscopically the bowel was firm, solid with no obvious peristalsis due to the serosal fibrosis explaining the symptoms of obstruction. The bowel was inspected by the bowel surgeon and a number of biopsies were taken.
Histological analysis from the peritoneal fluid showed mixed inflammatory cells and markedly reactive mesothelial cells. Interestingly, the ovaries were normal and the uterus contained an infracted ischaemic fibroid. Sections from the omentum and small bowel showed a fibrous process with spindle cells and inflammation. Overall this indicated diffuse sclerosing peritonitis.
Her postoperative recovery was uneventful and at her six-week follow-up she had made an excellent recovery. She remained asymptomatic at her six-month follow-up. A CT that was performed at the time when compared to previous imaging showed complete resolution of her ascites and a normal appearance of the bowel.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 20-year-old healthy male presented to the emergency department after falling from a skateboard. He sustained blunt trauma to his right chest wall, resulting in pleuritic pain and mild dyspnea. Diagnostic workup included chest radiography (CXR), which showed no acute findings (). Further evaluation with chest computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated fractures of the right 4th through 6th ribs. Herniation of the middle lobe of the right lung was also identified on CT scan ().
The patient was admitted for observation and pain management. His pain and dyspnea improved and he was managed conservatively. A repeat CXR on hospital day two was stable, and the patient was discharged home. Ten days after discharge a follow-up chest CT scan was completed and demonstrated a decrease in herniated lung ().","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 50-year-old man with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) evolved to end-stage renal failure and hemodialysis was started in 1992. Because of voluminous kidneys, a right nephrectomy was performed in 1992, followed by the left one in 1994. In April 1998, a deceased donor kidney transplantation was performed in the right iliac fossa. Induction therapy consisted in seven days of polyclonal anti-T-cell globulin (thymoglobulin), because of delayed graft function. Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine (CsA) and prednisone. Steroids were withdrawn in December 1998. No acute rejection was observed. At one month, the serum creatinine was 130 μmol/L and the glomerular filtration rate was estimated at 61 mL/min/1.73 m2 by MDRD. The serum creatinine remained stable during the followup and was of 113 μmol/L in March 2011.
During the followup in our outpatient clinic, the patient suffered from recurrent episodes of hepatic cyst infections, treated by antibiotics. In April 2007, bloating and abdominal discomfort developed. An abdominal MRI was performed showing a marked hepatomegaly with incomplete chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome, due to extrinsic venous compression by voluminous liver cysts. Because of worsening symptoms and many hepatic cyst infections, a new MRI was performed in June 2008, showing an increasing liver volume without progression of the Budd-Chiari syndrome. The liver volume was 3517 mL at this time. Because of preliminary data suggesting a potential benefit of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors therapy on hepatic cyst growth, CsA was stopped and sirolimus started at 0.5 mg/d to achieve serum levels between 4 and 6 ug/L (). MRIs were performed during the mTOR therapy because of worsening symptoms, and a followup was made with volumetric hepatic MRI. Only total hepatic volume was measured. Six months later, a new MRI showed a continuing increase in liver volume, which was estimated at 3883 mL. In November 2009, the liver volume was 4240 mL and in June 2010, 4400 mL (). The chronic partial Budd-Chiari syndrome did not change.
Under sirolimus therapy, our patient did not report adverse events like cutaneous rash, diarrhea, and aphthous stomatitis, but he developed important legs edema. Hyperlipidemia was controlled with pravastatin and there was no significant proteinuria. Because of the continuing increase in liver volume (i.e., no significant effect of sirolimus) and the important discomfort due to bilateral legs edema, sirolimus was stopped and CsA restarted in June 2010. The differential diagnosis of leg edema was venous compression due to hepatomegaly. After restarting CsA therapy, the leg edema resolved, which was consistent with a sirolimus side effect. Fifteen months after sirolimus was stopped, a new MRI was done. The liver volume was at 4700 mL (). The average hepatic growth over the two years of sirolimus therapy was of 37.5 mL per month versus 20 mL per month with cyclosporine.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"We examined a 33-year-old male with progressive painless decrease in vision and nystagmus since childhood and no history of night blindness. His best corrected visual acuity was 20/80 with 0.00 diopter sphere (D Sph) / -4.00 diopter cylinder (D Cyl) X 10° in the right eye and 20/60 with 0.00 D Sph / -3.50 D Cyl X 170° in the left eye respectively. Color vision was normal on examination with Ishihara plates. A positive history of similar abnormality was obtained in his sibling (elder brother had similar abnormality). There was no history of consanguinity. Slit-lamp examination was normal and iris did not show any transillumination defect. Intraocular pressure using applanation tonometry was 15 mm of Hg in both eyes. Fundus examination showed macular vascularization, macular hypoplasia and hypoplasic optic nerve head with diffuse retinal pigment epithelial atrophy and prominent choroidal vessels in both eyes. Patient was clinically diagnosed to have foveal hypoplasia. A genetic analysis revealed an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern.
SD-OCT (Copernicus, Italy) was done in both eyes using asterisk scan protocol (7 mm length scan, 6 B-scans with 2743 A-scans per B-scan). SD-OCT was recorded with the eyes in the null zone, to overcome nystagmus. The scan location was assured by positioning the asterisk scan acquisition pattern over the foveal area and this location was assured as the scan passes through the fovea in the fundus image obtained in SD-OCT. The scan revealed absence of foveal dip, preservation of the inner retinal layers with thickened fovea, 270 microns in the right eye and 245 microns in the left eye. The qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the retina were similar in macular and peripheral areas (2° and 7° respectively). The small elevation of the inner segment/ outer segment (IS/OS) junction was absent in the fovea which is otherwise present in normal eyes.
Microperimetry (MP1, Nidek Technologies, Padova, Italy) using 33 stimuli in the central 20° of the macula and 4-2 threshold strategy revealed reduction of retinal sensitivity in the central retina. Mean retinal sensitivity was 7.2 dB in the right eye and 14.2 dB in the left eye. Relative scotoma was present in both eyes at the foveal area. Fixation was relatively unstable in both eyes, with abnormal fixation location (central fixation in the right eye and eccentric fixation in the left eye). Average eye movements during the microperimetry were 1.27°/sec in the right eye and 1.49°/sec in the left eye. Figs. and describe the color fundus photography, microperimetry and SD-OCT findings in our case. Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF) imaging with confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (Heidelberg Retina Angiograph, HRA II, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) did not show the typical foveal darkening in both eyes [].","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 55-year-old male with a past medical history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastritis, presented to our emergency department via ambulance with a chief complaint of lightheadedness, associated with nausea and vomiting. The patient reported feeling lightheaded two hours prior to arrival, along with nausea and three episodes of non-bloody emesis. The patient underwent cardiac ablation one month prior for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He denied chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, syncope, weakness, numbness, or tingling. He received 324 mg of aspirin en route. On physical exam, his heart rate was significantly elevated at 191 beats per minute, and he was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 61/57 mmHg. His pulse oximetry was 98% on room air, and he was afebrile.
The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) showed wide complex tachycardia (WCT) (Figure ). Since the patient was hypotensive, and therefore hemodynamically unstable, the decision was made to cardiovert the patient with informed consent. The patient was successfully cardioverted with 100 joules (J) of electricity on a biphasic device.
The patient’s heart rate improved to 89 beats per minute following the cardioversion, and his blood pressure normalized (Figure ). The patient was no longer lightheaded and nauseated. The patient’s troponin came back at 0.01 ng/mL (normal), he did not have any electrolyte abnormalities or anemia. His thyroid-stimulating hormone level was also normal.
The patient was admitted for cardiac workup, and started on flecainide and nebivolol (a beta1 selective blocker) by the cardiologist then discharged home. The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout his hospital stay.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"Patient two was a 13-month old female with bilateral RB when she experienced ischemia of her left choroid. She was heterozygous for the A1298C polymorphism and experienced an infarction after her third cycle of carboplatin OAC to the left eye only, anesthetically induced by nitrous oxide. Two prior OAC infusions were done with sevoflurane induction alone. She received 47 min of nitrous oxide, with 65.6% max ET N2O, and the procedure was without acute complications.

"A 60-year-old black man – born in the Rio de Janeiro city and living in Teresópolis, RJ, Brazil – reported that when he was taking the mail from his mailbox, he accidentally put his left arm on six specimens of light green and brown caterpillars, which had about 5 cm length. The animals were crushed by the arm of the man, who, immediately, withdrawn it. He washed the arm using soap and water, applied alcohol to the affected area and also took an anti-allergy drug (could not say which).
The site affected by the caterpillars became swollen and after 20 minutes a burning sensation started. The victim also noticed a painful lymph node in the ipsilateral axilla, which disappeared spontaneously shortly after. In the same night, after dinner, he had abdominal distension associated with discomfort and vomiting. He did not take medicines to relieve the symptoms. As there was improvement, he laid down to sleep. After that, the man woke up at dawn feeling an intense abdominal pain (flank region) and arthralgia (upper and lower limbs), which became worse when he attempted to move.
Subsequently, the patient looked for medical assistance and went to a local hospital. His clinical picture was described as pain associated with sudden anuria. He was admitted to the hospital to treatment. The man reported a previous history of nephrolithiasis and received treatment with saline solution, analgesics and urinary catheter to provide relief. He also received treatment for arterial hypertension with atenolol, 50 mg/day; until this time there was no evidence of kidney injury.
During the hospitalization, the patient had developed diffuse edema, flank pain and the anuria remained, despite of use of intravenous hydration and furosemide infusion. Laboratory and imaging tests were performed (Tables and ).
After two more days, the patient was transferred to the Hospital das Clínicas de Teresópolis Costantino Ottaviano (HCTCO), where he remained for forty-five days due to hemodialysis treatment. Four days after the admission to HCTCO, he remembered the episode with the caterpillars in the morning before the painful crisis and anuria. That was the moment when the suspicion of erucism by Lonomia aroused (seven days after the accident).
The use of SALon was not indicated because the patient did not meet the criteria for it, particularly due to the time elapsed since the accident, hospital care for more than 10 hours and less than or equal to 36 hours []. During the admission the patient showed bruises scattered on upper and lower limbs and two voluminous cases of melena. After those events, there was no spontaneous recovery of renal function, which progressed to chronic renal disease (CRD), stage V – end-stage renal disease, when the glomerular filtration rate is below 15% of normal and the patient needs, invariably, renal replacement therapy.
Lonomia caterpillar has about six to seven centimeters long, and its color ranges from light brownish-green to yellowish-brown with three longitudinal stripes of dark-brown []. Its body is covered with bristles that contain toxins. The transformation to an adult moth occurs after a in ten weeks after three to six months of larval life [,].
Lonomia is found throughout Brazil, however, numerous registered cases of erucism occurred in the southern region, mainly in Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina states, and were attributed to L. obliqua[,]. In recent years, there have been accidents in Minas Gerais, Goiás, Maranhão and Rio de Janeiro states [,,].
Erucism caused by Lonomia is uncommon in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Therefore, the present study is one of the first cases reported in the state. The increased rate of envenomations – especially in areas where they were not previously described – has been attributed to deforestation of indigenous trees, natural habitat of caterpillars, which are forced migrating to fruit trees in urban areas [,].
The symptoms of Lonomia envenomation range from local cutaneous manifestations to serious and potentially fatal systemic reactions []. General symptoms such as headache, unspecific indisposition, fever, nausea, vomit, arthralgia, myalgia, conjunctivitis and abdominal pain vary depending on the species involved, the intensity of the contact and the victim’s response [,,,]. Hemorrhagic syndrome and acute renal failure (ARF) are unusual outcomes, but potentially fatal [,-].
The pathophysiological mechanisms of ARF in Lonomia envenomig are not clear yet. Probably, there is a relation between renal ischemia and systemic hypotension and/or fibrin deposition in glomerular capillaries [-]. Another hypothesis is that venom components may act directly on the kidneys [,].
Lonomia spp. venom is rich in several toxins that have procoagulant and fibrinolytic activities, which can significantly affect the blood coagulation process. For example, the enzyme lonofibrase is able to trigger a hemorrhagic syndrome similar to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) by increasing fibrinogen degradation products and decreasing plasminogen, fibrinogen and factor XIII [,,,-]. Lonomia obliqua venom contains several lipocalins (protein group that transports hydrophobic molecules), among which is the Lonomia obliqua prothrombin activator protein (Lopap), involved in the increase of expression of adhesion molecules on cellular surface [-].
Erucism is diagnosed based on history of contact with the caterpillar and corroborated by data from laboratory tests. Laboratory abnormalities include slightly low platelet count, high urea and creatinine levels, slight increase of total bilirubin, and augmentation of indirect bilirubin, free hemoglobin and haptoglobin decrease in cases of hemolysis [].
Treatment consists of washing the affected area with cold water, cold compresses, local anesthetic infiltration using lidocaine 2% and topical corticosteroids. In case of bleeding, the patient should be kept resting in order to avoid traumatic intervention [,]. The antilonomic serum (SALon) is indicated according to the severity of the accident, and its early administration prevents bleeding manifestations that start from one to ten days after the contact depending on its intensity and location [,,-].","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"The patient was a 58-year-old woman suffering from lower abdominal pain and vomiting, which gradually worsened from the start of December 2017. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed multiple gastric ulcers and scars, and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed inflammation in the large intestine. The patient had undergone surgery in 1997 for cervical carcinoma, followed by postoperative radiotherapy that involved irradiation of her pelvis and stomach. On the basis of the symptoms, endoscopy findings, and medical history, the patient was diagnosed with refractory multiple gastric ulcers, enterocolitis, and paralytic ileus due to late radiation-induced sequelae.
As a result of frequent vomiting, the patient had become unable to ingest orally. She was hospitalized in October 2018 and fasted before being placed under central venous nutrition control. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was started to treat the intractable multiple gastric ulcers and ileus. Thirty treatment sessions were scheduled over a period of approximately 1–2 months. Pentazocine and tramadol were administered to treat the abdominal pain, but these achieved poor results.
At hospitalization, the patient was 155 cm tall and weighed 43 kg. Although she exhibited abdominal distention, no muscular defense or rebound pain was observed. On percussion, the bowel sound was attenuated. A blood examination revealed anemia, slight liver dysfunction, low protein levels, and hypoalbuminemia. An abdominal X-ray showed several small intestinal niveau and extension of the colon and small intestine by intestinal gas (Fig. a).
The patient experienced increased lower abdominal pain during bowel movements and felt relieved after defecation. Consequently, we hypothesized that her abdominal pain was due to poor peristalsis of the intestinal tract and that blocking the sympathetic nerve of the intestinal tract would help normalize the peristaltic movement and relieve the pain. The pain was strongest in the lower abdomen at the level of the 12th thoracic nerve. An epidural catheter was inserted via the lumbar1–2 intervertebral space, and continuous epidural anesthesia with 0.2% ropivacaine at 4 ml/h was administered for 1 week, resulting in good control of the lower abdominal pain and defecation. This allowed the tramadol, which promotes constipation, to be discontinued. A block of the inferior mesenteric artery plexus with ethanol was performed, resulting in an immediate improvement in the patient’s bowel movements and defecation, and a reduction in lower abdominal pain, now measured as 3 on a numerical rating scale (NRS = 3). An abdominal X-ray was performed after the block procedure, showing the number of intestinal niveau and the amount of gas had decreased, as compared to that before the block (Fig. b). The control of lower abdominal pain was effective, and defecation was noted. Tube feeding was started 4 days after the inferior mesenteric artery plexus block, and oral feeding was started 2 days later.
Twelve days after the block, the patient’s lower abdominal pain increased to NRS 8 and there was recrudescence of the vomiting. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed dilation of the small intestine, as well as the formation of niveau; however, no bowel obstruction or disruption of blood flow was observed (Fig. a).
An upper gastrointestinal contrast examination with contrast medium (Gastrografin®, Bayer Yakuhin Ltd., Osaka, Japan) showed relatively good peristaltic movement of the large and small intestine but poor gastric peristaltic movement. A large amount of food residue was also observed. An epidural catheter was inserted via the thoracic 6–7 intervertebral space for innervation of the upper gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach and small intestine, and continuous epidural anesthesia with 0.2% ropivacaine at 4 ml/h was started. This alleviated the abdominal pain, and the vomiting disappeared.
Approximately 2 weeks later, continuous epidural anesthesia was stopped, and a splanchnic nerve block with ethanol was performed (Fig. c). This resulted in an improvement in the lower abdominal pain to NRS 1, as well as an increase in food intake. The following day, CT showed a large improvement in the ileus (Fig. b). An upper gastrointestinal contrast examination showed that peristaltic movement of the upper gastrointestinal tract had improved (Fig. ). The subsequent course was good, and the hyperbaric oxygen therapy was completed. The patient was discharged from hospital at the end of January. At the outpatient visit 2 weeks later, the general condition of the patient was good and she could orally intake her normal diet.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"The patient was a thirty-year old clerk. She complained of an abnormal warm sensation in her left breast. She consulted her doctors regarding this problem, but was reassured that it was normal. Sixteen months later she noted a definite lump in her left breast, and an excision biopsy was done. The lump recurred two months later, and a similar procedure was performed. Both biopsies were reported as benign haemangiomas. The lesion recurred during the next two months and, this time, she approached our clinic. Physical examination revealed a mass which measured approximately 6 cm. She was advised mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction. She refused, but one month later, returned to our hospital with a haemorrhaging lesion in the left breast (). She was found to be pale, but was haemodynamically stable. She underwent radiological embolisation of the lesion. The angiogram showed a tumour blush that had feeding arteries from branches of the left internal mammary artery and lateral thoracic artery. Embolisation of the feeding vessels was done using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Post-embolisation images showed complete occlusion of these feeding vessels (). She later consented for mastectomy. The tumour was completely excised and was reported as a grade 2 angiosarcoma. Radiotherapy of the chest wall was given, and investigations showed multiple lung metastases and bone metastases. She, however, refused palliative chemotherapy. Five months after mastectomy, she returned with right hypochondrium pain and abdominal distension. On clinical examination, she was pale. Her haemoglobin was 6 g/dl with a platelet count of 83 x 109/L. The low platelet count could be attributed to continuing platelet consumption due to formation of thrombi in the vascular metastatic lesions. Her abdomen was found to be grossly distended, tense, and tender. The fluid thrill test was positive. CT scan of the abdomen revealed multiple liver metastases with free fluid in the peritoneal cavity. The main hepatic artery was successfully embolised. Palliation of symptoms was achieved with analgesics, repeated peritoneal tapping, and blood transfusions. The patient also developed minor local recurrence on the chest wall, which fortunately did not bleed. Seven months after treatment and 28 months after initial excision biopsy, she deteriorated rapidly and passed away.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 46-year-old male visited the emergency department of our hospital on April 23, 2015 due to fever and headache for three days and impaired memory for half a day. The patient had experienced fever three days before, with a peak body temperature of 38.5 °C. No other discomfort was described. He had visited other hospitals before and was diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection based on haematological findings. However, his condition did not improve after treatment with intravenous levofloxacin. Within a half a day, he developed impaired memory, concomitant with speech disturbance, poor response, no significant limb movements and convulsions before being referred to the emergency department of our hospital. The patient had no medical history. No histories of food and drug allergies were obtained. The patient denied any prior history of smoking, heavy drinking or drug abuse. On arrival, the initial physical examination revealed the following: body temperature 38.0 °C, pulse 100 beats/min, respirations 26 breaths/min, blood pressure 144/76 mmHg, delirium, speech disturbance, equal size and round shape of bilateral pupils with diameters of approximately 3.0 mm, sensitive to light reflex, basically normal cranial nerve examination, limb muscle strength Grade V, negative bilateral pathological signs, and no ataxia. The patient’s neck was soft, and there were no signs of meningeal irritation. No significant findings were found on the cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations. No skin rashes or bleeding sites were observed after examining the entire body. The laboratory test results were the following: haematology: white blood cells (WBC), 12.5 × 109/L, neutrophil percentage, 87.6%; C-reactive protein (CRP), 56 mg/L; procalcitonin (PCT), 2.8 ng/mL; and D-dimer, 3.2 μg/mL. A chemistry panel and screens for infectious diseases and cardiac markers were generally normal. No abnormal findings were observed on chest X-ray or electrocardiogram. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed a curved high-density mass at the left sylvian fissure area and an ischemic lesion of the left temporal lobe (Fig. ).
As an emergency diagnosis, massive cerebral infarction (probable atherosclerosis of the left internal carotid artery system) was considered, and intracranial infection could not be excluded; appropriate treatments included aspirin for anti-platelet aggregation, atorvastatin for lipid regulation and plaque stabilization, and cefuroxime and acyclovir for anti-infection.
The patient experienced aggravated unconsciousness after two hours of admission, and physical examination showed the following: lethargy, aphasia, equal size and round shape of bilateral pupils with diameters of approximately 3.0 mm, sensitive to light reflex, shallow right nasolabial folds, immobilization of right limbs upon orbital pressure, movable left limbs, positive right pathological signs and negative left pathological signs. Further revascularization therapy was considered, and the patient was immediately transferred to undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). On the way to the radiology department, the patient experienced further aggravation of unconsciousness and entered a light coma, concomitant with limb seizure, gazing to the left of bilateral eyes, equal size and round shape of bilateral pupils with diameters of approximately 2.0 mm, and disappearance of the light reflex. Appropriate treatments included midazolam for epilepsy, mannitol for dehydration and intracranial hypotension. After termination of the seizure, re-examination of the brain CT showed a curved high-density mass at the left sylvian fissure area and a massive low-density area in the left temporal lobe with many high-density plot areas scattered within it. CT images also showed compressed deformation of the left ventricle and a shift of the brain midline to the right (Fig. ). Considering that the patient developed haemorrhagic transformation, he was admitted to the emergency intensive care unit for further management.
Eighteen hours after admission, the patient experienced further aggravation of unconsciousness and entered a moderate coma, concomitant with high fever (body temperature 39.9 °C), bilateral pupils: left versus right = 5.0 mm versus 3.0 mm, respectively, disappearance of the light reflex, increased muscle tone of the right limbs, and positive pathological signs of bilateral limbs. The brain CT re-examination showed expansion of the bleeding area, with overt signs of brain herniation. The patient underwent emergency left frontal temporal craniotomy, removal of the intracranial hematoma and a decompressed craniotomy performed by neurosurgeons. The intraoperative findings were as follows: dark red appearance of the left temporal brain tissue, concomitant with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH); an ostomy of approximately 0.2 cm was created along the left temporal sulcus; a visible purple blood clot was observed, concomitant with surrounding contused brain tissues; and a large vascular embolization could be observed in the hematoma cavity. Approximately 10 mL of the hematoma and contused brain tissues were removed and sampled for pathological evaluation. Histopathological examination showed haemorrhage, oedema and inflammatory changes in brain tissues, neutrophil infiltration into the vascular walls and surrounding tissues, and microvascular purulent thrombosis (Figs. –). The patient was transferred to the neurologic intensive care unit for further treatment after the operation. During the course of the treatment, negative findings were found for Chlamydia pneumoniae, mycopsslasma, influenza, tuberculosis, the TORCH panel, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); the sputum culture was negative, and the blood culture suggested Staphylococcus aureus. No abnormal findings were found on chest X-ray or ultrasound. In addition, two transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) examinations were normal, and there were no observations of valvular dysfunction or neoplasm. The following final diagnosis was considered: massive cerebral infarction, consistent with haemorrhagic transformation (the left internal carotid artery system, inflammatory thrombus), Staphylococcus aureus sepsis and symptomatic epilepsy. After two months of vancomycin anti-infective treatments and supportive and symptomatic treatment, the consciousness of the patient improved gradually, and several blood cultures were negative. He underwent rehabilitation and was discharged from the hospital on the 72nd postoperative day (POD). At discharge, his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was E4V4M6, and the modified Rankin scale score was 3.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"Figure a shows the pedigree of our patients. A 70-year-old woman (II-4) was admitted to our hospital due to a 6-year history of progressive gait disturbance. At the age of 45 years, she developed bilateral hearing deficits, and at 64 years, she underwent surgery to correct cataracts and glaucoma. Neurological examination of the patient revealed mild external ophthalmoparesis, nystagmus, sensory neural hearing loss, dysarthria, and severe cerebellar ataxia. There was mild proximal muscle weakness of the limbs. Tendon reflexes were reduced generally. Electroencephalogram (EEG) assessment showed diffuse paroxysmal slow activity (3–6 Hz), which was induced by photo-stimulation. No epileptic discharge was found. Needle electromyography showed low amplitude and short motor-unit potential in the proximal extremities. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed atrophy of frontal lobe and cerebellar cortex (Fig. ). There was no lactate peak on brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy in a voxel placed over a lateral ventricle. Laboratory test results revealed normal lactate levels and slightly increased pyruvic acid levels. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. The psychometric test showed impaired intelligence, memory, and frontal function.
The proband’s mother (I-2) suffered from hearing loss and glaucoma. Since the age of 80, she had slowly become progressively bedridden. She died at the age of 84.
The proband’s first daughter (III-2) is 41 years old and has had palindromic rheumatism since the age of 14 years. She has not experienced convulsion, myoclonic event or stroke-like episodes, but has had recurrent migraine attacks. Brain MRI showed multiple, small hyper-intense areas in subcortical white matter of the cerebrum on a T2-weighted sequence. Her neurological examination showed no abnormalities.
The proband’s second daughter (III-3) is 39 years old and has experienced photo-induced myoclonus since the age 36 years. At that time, atrophy of the cerebellum was noted on MRI. At the age of 38 years, she started taking anticonvulsant medication due to negative myoclonus and photo-induced myoclonus on EEG examination. Her neurological examination showed an absence of tendon reflexes in all limbs and mild truncal ataxia. Muscle strength and mental status were normal.
The proband’s first granddaughter (IV-1) is 17 years old. She was delivered with the aid of a vacuum extractor at 37 gestational weeks. At the age of 15 years, loss of consciousness lasting a few seconds and myoclonic jerks in her upper extremities and trunk appeared. Two years later, she experienced her first generalized seizure with an abnormal EEG record and started taking antiepileptic drugs. School records indicated below average academic performance. Her neurological examination showed an absence of tendon reflexes in all four limbs and slight cognitive decline. Coordination and muscle strength were normal.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"The 51-year-old male patient exhibited a 10-day history of low back pain, limited waist motion and right lower limb numbness. The patient reported no pain at other sites, exhibited no fever or night sweats and was unable to recall any recent injury. The patient’s past medical history was unremarkable for trauma or other bone diseases. A physical examination demonstrated localized tenderness and percussion pain over the L4 spinous process, restricted waist motion and numbness of the right leg. Laboratory tests, including full blood cell count, serum electrolytes, renal and liver function tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), did not reveal any abnormalities. An X-ray revealed that the lesion was limited to the left lateral mass of the atlas, causing a potential instability (). Computed tomography (CT) revealed an osteolytic lesion in the right lateral mass of the L4 and accessories, accompanied by a paravertebral and intraspinal soft tissue extension (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed osteolytic destruction of the vertebral body associated with a mild compression fracture that exhibited hypointensity on T1-weighted (T1-W) images and hyperintensity on T2-weighted (T2-W) images (). On the basis of the radiological features of the lesion, there was a high possibility that the patient had a neoplastic lesion. However, the radiological features of the lesion were not sufficient to establish the diagnosis of LCH with certainty. A C-arm X-ray machine-guided needle biopsy of the vertebral body was performed and the histopathological diagnosis was LCH. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD1a and S-100 (). Further diagnostic evaluation included a bone scan, CT of the lungs, pituitary hormonal evaluation and brain CT and abdominal ultrasound evaluation. No other LCH infiltration was identified in the patient and the patient was treated as suffering from a single-system and single-site disease.
The patient underwent PVP (Stryker, Inc., Meyzieu, France) under local anesthesia in the prone position with the belly suspended in midair, under C-arm imaging guidance (). The amount of bone cement used to fill in the L4 was 3.6 ml. The blood loss during surgery was 5 ml. The spread of the cement was ideal with the exception of a small amount of paravertebral leakage of cement () which did not cause any symptoms. No complications were observed during the surgery or follow-up. After lying in bed for 6 h, the patient was able to sit freely and 24 h postoperatively, the patient was allowed to walk freely. Following the procedure, the low back pain was resolved completely and the patient’s neurological symptoms were rapidly alleviated and then gradually continued to be alleviated. The patient required the use of a weak opioid prior to the PVP but did not receive an analgesic afterwards. Notably, CT revealed a significant decrease in the paravertebral and intraspinal soft tissue extension 5 days after the PVP ().
The patient received chemotherapy following PVP. The chemotherapy regime was 100 mg etoposide (days 1–3) and 60, 40 and 20 mg prednisone (days 1–7, 8–14 and 15–21, respectively) for 3 cycles. There were no serious side-effects of the chemotherapy. CT revealed that the paravertebral and intraspinal soft tissue extension disappeared after 3 cycles (). The height of the vertebral body remained stable without further collapse and lumbar kyphosis did not occur. There was no recurrence and no other complaints over a 6-month follow-up period ().","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 72-year-old Asian male was consulted to our hospital with sudden scrotal swelling but no additional symptoms. His past history included low risk CLL in revised Rai stage 0 without any treatment 16 years ago. On physical examination, his left scrotum was slightly swollen, whereas his right scrotum had marked swelling and a detectable hard mass. Blood examination showed high levels of white blood cell (27 840 μL: normal range 3300–8600) and LDH (341 U/L: normal range 124–222); however, other abnormalities including for the testicular tumor markers, serum alpha fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotropin, were not evident. Enhanced CT showed a round, bilateral testicular tumors (right side 72 × 58 mm and left side 22 × 18 mm) with homogeneous iso-enhancement relative to normal testis, and 8-mm–sized para-aortic masses. These masses were slightly and gradually enhanced in dynamic contrast-enhanced CT without any suspicious lesions of visceral metastases noted except the surrounding lesions of the para-aorta (Fig. a,b). MRI revealed a low intensity on T2-weighted images compared to those of normal testis and a low intensity on an apparent diffusion coefficients map (Fig. c,d). The clinical diagnosis was bilateral testicular tumors including malignant lymphoma, and after informed consent, an immediate bilateral orchiectomy was performed. The tumor was solitary, and rounded shape, with the cut surface of that showing a yellowish color (Fig. a). Pathological finding revealed that the tumor consisted of blastemal cells, each with an atypical small round shape, and scant cytoplasm. These cells morphologically composed of confluent sheets of large neoplastic B lymphocytes resembling either centroblasts or immunoblasts (Figs b,c,a). The tumor lesion of large neoplastic B lymphocytes was immunoreactive for CD20 (Fig. b), and negative for CD5 (Fig. c), CD3 (Fig. d), and CD23 (Fig. e). Atypical small round cells around large neoplastic B lymphocytes were immunoreactive for CD20, CD5, CD23, and Bcl2 (Fig. f), and negative for CD3. These histopathological findings were consistent with a DLBCL variant, a transformation of CLL, with the final diagnosis being RS. PET–CT revealed the presence of positive lesions in the nasal septum, a tiny subcutaneous tumor in front of the left chest, and bilateral adrenal glands that could not be detected on CT (Fig. e–h). Therefore, the patient immediately underwent an induction combination of rituximab with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone immunochemotherapy, and the intrathecal administration of chemotherapeutic agents, including methotrexate, cytarabine, and prednisone. After four cycles of the regimen, the patient showed a complete response in an imaging study. Totally, eight cycles of chemotherapy was performed, and the patient was monitored on an outpatient basis. He was successfully in remission for 14 months after the end of immunochemotherapy.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 37-years-old primigravida at 40 weeks gestation was brought to our hospital by ambulance following collapse at home. No obstetric notes were brought in. On admission she was anxious, apyrexial, dyspnoeic, and distressed.
On clinical examination she was hypoxic, with oxygen saturation of 68% on air and respiratory rate of 30/minutes. Blood pressure was 150/90, and Glascow coma scale was 11/15. There were no signs of labour. Soon after arrival she had a seizure. Following the seizure there was an episode of fetal bradycardia and an urgent caesarean section was performed under GA. The baby was delivered in good condition. There was no evidence of placental abruption or any other cause for fetal bardycardia. Patient's vitals were stable during the caesarean section. She was transferred to Intensive Care Unit, where she was intubated and ventilated. A CT chest showed extensive bilateral pnenumothoarces of greater than 70% in the left side and extensive opacities in the semicollapsed right lower lobe (see Figures and ). The CT head was normal. A left-sided chest drain was inserted on the same day. This was removed on the following day after patient's clinical condition had improved. Patient has no symptoms or signs which suggestive of Pre-eclamsia.
Following the caesarean section the family arrived. At this stage we found that the patient had longstanding right pleural endometriosis with multiple pneumothoraces and hydrothoraces and underwent right-sided pleurodesis in 2003. This lady was booked in at tertiary hospital for pregnancy care. She had regular followups with a Chest physician and Obstetrician. At 29 weeks gestation the patient had presented with mild dyspneoa and the chest X-ray revealed a small effusion but no significant pneumothorax. The cardiothoracic surgeon suggested that since the pleura was well stuck down, there was a low risk for expanding pnuemothorax. This patient still presented with severe hypoxia with pneumothorax. The Cardiothoracic surgeon further advised assistance with instrumental delivery as small risk of increased pneumothorax in the second stage of labour during pushing. Epidural or spinal anaesthesia was recommended and to avoid General anaesthesia. If general anaesthesia was needed then intermittent positive pressure ventilation should be used. The Obstetrician had planned for induction of labour at 41 weeks gestation. On the 4th day of postcaesarian section, the patient again complained of shortness of breath. On general examination the patient was dyspneic and tachypneic. Her blood pressure was normal, she had no proteinuria, and her liver function and platelets were within normal limits.
Chest X-ray showed that she had left-sided lower lobe pneumonia and was started on intravenous tazocin, IV gentamicin, and then on oral erythromycin. Patient recovered well and was transferred to a tertiary hospital.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 19-year-old female with no significant past medical history was referred to the emergency department from her antenatal clinic for further evaluation of fever 102 F, headache, malaise, nausea, and vomiting of 4-days duration following mild sore throat. She was in her 28th week of gestation on presentation. Physical examination showed an obese and anxious-appearing lady in mild respiratory distress with gravid abdomen. She weighed 142 kilograms (kg) with a BMI of 44.3. Her blood pressure was 111/60 mmHg, respiratory rate 24, heart rate 111, temperature 101.8 F, and oxygen saturation 96% on 2 liters (L) nasal cannula oxygen. She had dry mucous membranes, with no oral thrush or ulcers. Her abdomen was gravid with focal areas of tenderness, bowel sounds were heard, and fetal movement was detected. Pulmonary and cardiovascular examinations were unremarkable.
Her initial laboratory tests were significant for white blood cell (WBC) count of 11.8 K/uL with 78% neutrophil predominance and lymphopenia (0.77 K/uL). Although she had no urinary symptoms, urinalysis showed bacteriuria, confirmed as group B streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) with cultures. Initial chest X-ray and liver enzymes on admission were unremarkable. She was started on intravenous fluids for suspected gastroenteritis and oral cephalexin for asymptomatic GBS infection. Stool studies for clostridium difficile, comprehensive panel, ova, and parasites were ordered which all returned negative. However, she continued to spike fever through the third day of hospitalization prompting expansion of antibiotic coverage to Vancomycin and Zosyn (). Liver transaminases which had been normal began to spike. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 190, alanine aminotransferase (AST) was 135, and alkaline phosphatase was 110 while bilirubin remained normal. Serum Tylenol and hepatitis A, B, and C serologies were negative. Infectious Disease (ID) consultation was requested who recommended further infectious work-up with CMV, EBV, HIV, HSV, Rickettsia, and Leptospira serologies.
The patient continued to spike high grade fever reaching 103 F on day 4 of admission despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics and negative infectious work-up including the aforementioned serologies. She also developed bloody diarrhea and acute kidney injury (AKI) prompting evaluation for possible Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and autoimmune diseases which all returned negative as well. Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed normal liver and gallbladder morphologies. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed diffuse T2 hyperintensity throughout the liver compatible with acute liver injury but was negative for any focal intra-abdominal or pelvic abscess.
One week into her hospitalization, her AST and ALT kept trending up reaching a peak of 1712 U/L and 845 U/L, respectively (), mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase 140, INR 1.6, normal total bilirubin, absolute lymphocyte count of 0.11 K/uL, persistently negative blood cultures, and serum creatinine increased to 2.9 mg/dL, all concerning for a disseminated process. She became increasingly lethargic, tachycardic, and tachypneic necessitating care in the intensive care unit. With uprising liver enzymes and negative extensive infectious and rheumatologic work-up including Hep A, B, C serologies and PCR, EBV, CMV, Parvovirus, Rickettsia, and Leptospiral serologies, as well as negative HSV 1 and 2 IgM and IgG antibodies, antinuclear, and anti-liver-kidney microsomal antibodies, normal cryoglobulins, ceruloplasmin, alpha 1 antitrypsin and serum copper levels, and largely unremarkable imaging and stool studies, a decision was made to proceed with a liver biopsy. At this time, empiric acyclovir was started while other antibiotics were discontinued per ID recommendations.
Within the first 24 hours of starting acyclovir, AST and ALT began to downtrend while fever and diarrhea improved (). Despite negative HSV-2 serologies, the PCR was reported on hospital day-8 with a very high viral load >100 million DNA copies/ml following which she reported a remote history of cold sores but denied a history of genital ulcers. A diagnosis of HSV hepatitis was made and she was transitioned to Val-acyclovir 1 gram three times daily to complete 14 days of therapy, then to resume acyclovir 400 mg three times daily until delivery to prevent recurrence. On the 12th day of hospitalization, she was discharged home without needing a biopsy anymore and with complete resolution of symptoms and improvement of liver enzymes and AKI; AST 72, ALT 208, alkaline phosphatase 150, total bilirubin 0.5 and creatinine 0.5. She remained symptom-free with complete normalization of creatinine and liver enzymes at outpatient follow-up two weeks after discharge. She was eventually delivered of a healthy baby boy via cesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation with no peripartum complications.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"‘Mr. C’ is a 58-year-old Navy veteran with a history of substance use disorder in sustained remission, traumatic brain injury (TBI), mild neurocognitive impairment, and a 15-year diagnosis of schizophrenia. Importantly, his sister indicated that Mr. C suffered his first psychiatric break during adolescence. He was prescribed medication, but his parents, who indicated their preference for treating his condition with prayer, refused these. He has been living with his sister for the past 20 years and participates in all activities of daily living. He is a widower and is currently unemployed. His TBI history includes a single episode approximately 25 years ago when he fell off a moving train, requiring extended hospitalization. Mr. C was brought in to our Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital by his sister after calling the Veterans’ Crisis Line with SI. One week earlier there was an altercation with his brother-in-law resulting in Mr. C attacking him with a crowbar and the sister intervening. On admission, the family reported that Mr. C was taking venlafaxine and quetiapine.
Upon initial interview, Mr. C was grossly oriented, with psychomotor agitation, mildly pressured speech, anxious mood, and restricted affect. Thought process was tangential, and his cooperation was poor due to his preoccupation with delusions that he was dead, that nothing existed. He felt his body was being energized by demons: “These demons are my energy, I am dead, how can I have any energy?” He perseverated on this content despite attempts to engage him: “How can you help me, I am dead.” When asked about suicidal ideation (SI) he indicated, “I am dead, how can I be suicidal?” When providers commented on the novelty of speaking with a dead person, he replied, “Maybe you are dead too.” Importantly, his nihilistic beliefs included strong religiously mediated content not shared by his family. Mr. C. made the comments: “That physical God is alive because he has a physical body, but the demons inside me keep me dead, keep me from being alive.” “It is not nice meeting the devil, all the demonic spirits are tormenting me and raping me.” He believed his insides were being corroded by demons and indicated that he had repeatedly sodomized himself to try and purge himself of the demons. Mr. C’s sister indicated that the onset of his religiously themed delusional symptoms began after his TBI when he became convinced that a miracle had occurred during the accident and he became aware of his “dead nature.”
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in April 2015 revealed mild global volume loss for age with widening of the Sylvian fissure bilaterally. Neither evidence of past acute TBI or white matter abnormalities were noted on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging (Figure ). Neuropsychological testing administered during the index hospitalization was significant for impairment on tasks of processing speed, simple attention, verbal learning and memory, aspects of executive functioning (set-shifting, verbal fluency), facial recognition, and affect naming and recognition. Aspects of visuospatial discrimination and construction, confrontation naming, and visual memory were intact (Table ).
Upon initial presentation, given the patient’s aggressive and activated behavior as well as sleep difficulties, venlafaxine was discontinued and quetiapine was titrated to 700 mg. Divalproex was added during the admission for mood stabilization and titrated to 750 mg. During his 2 weeks on the inpatient ward repeated inquiry about his religious experience and his relationship to God led to changes in the content of Mr. C’s delusion from literal and concrete beliefs that he was physically dead to more abstract and metaphorical descriptions of spiritual death. His belief that only God was physically alive remained, and his belief that demons possessed his body persisted. Continued probing about the patient’s existence demonstrated further amelioration of the nihilistic content. A month into his admission when asked if his daily activities (eating, drinking, showering) were evidence that he was in fact physically alive, he indicated that he was ‘probably alive.’
Mr. C continued to be alert and oriented to person, place, and time, with evidence of increased insight into his preoccupation with his belief that he was dead. Approximately 1 month into his admission he recognized when the content of his speech began to focus on death, demons, and self-negation, at which point he would stop and remark, ‘There I go again talking about all that dead stuff.’ He was ultimately discharged after 5 weeks of hospitalization. On discharge, the patient’s brother noted that he was less delusional and more linear than at baseline.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 74-year-old man on rivaroxaban for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation presented with the gradual onset of neck pain. The pain started while he was walking in the woods and was associated with progressive weakness and numbness from the clavicles downward. He was able to walk back to his cabin, but upon arrival he was unable to maintain his balance and fell forward striking his head. He denied any loss of consciousness. He was unable to move for about 45 minutes. Emergency medical services was called and they noted the patient to be completely paralyzed with fecal incontinence. He also had shortness of breath. During his transport to the emergency department (ED) he started to regain strength and feeling in his arms and legs and improvement of his shortness of breath. He denied any recent fevers, upper respiratory infection, rash or tick bites. All other review of systems was negative. Past medical history was significant for hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease.
On initial examination, the patient was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Temperature was 92.0 degrees Fahrenheit tympanic, pulse 56 beats per minute, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, blood pressure 122/56 mmHg, oxygen saturation 100% on four liters nasal cannula. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. Heart was regular rate and rhythm, without any murmurs. Abdomen was soft, non-tender, non-distended with normal bowel sounds. Back had no evidence of trauma or deformity, non-tender to palpation. On extremity exam he had 4/5 strength in all extremities. After 20 minutes in the ED, he developed flaccid paralysis of all extremities with 0/5 strength. His voice also became softer and he developed shortness of breath. After five minutes he was able to wiggle his left toes. Over the next hour he slowly regained strength in his right lower extremity and his voice returned to normal. After another 40 minutes the patient was able to move his right upper and lower extremity and wiggle his toes on his left lower extremity. He was still unable to move his left upper extremity.
A computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed and did not show any evidence of aortic dissection. MRI of the cervical spine showed a prominent epidural hematoma, primarily dorsal, that extended from the foramen magnum down to cervical vertebra C7 and contributed to severe mass effect on the thecal sac (). Findings were the worst at C2–C3, where the hematoma measured 7–8 mm in width with compression of the cervical spinal cord and associated cord signal abnormality. In retrospect, findings were also visible on the preceding CTA. Patient was taken emergently to surgery for evacuation of the hematoma.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 1-year-old boy presented to us with complaints of a reddish patch on the anterior aspect of his neck with deficient skin over the lesion since birth. There was no associated history of any discharge, trauma, or bleeding. On examination, a single anterior cervical midline skin defect measuring 3 cm × 2 cm was present. There was an external opening of a sinus seen at the inferior margin of the defect []. No discharge was reported from the sinus opening. A diagnosis of midline cervical cleft was made, and the patient was taken up for surgery. The entire lesion along with the sinus tract down to the pretracheal fascia was excised. The sinus opening was connected to two small cysts inferiorly, and hence, the dissection was extended till manubrium sterni for complete excision. The skin defect was closed by a Z-plasty to avoid a contracture and flexion deformity of the neck []. Histology revealed two cystic lesions. The smaller cyst was lined by squamous epithelium, while the larger cyst was lined mostly by squamous epithelium and focally by respiratory epithelium []. The subepithelial stroma shows few serous acini. There was no evidence of thyroid tissue or lymphoid follicles. The features were consistent with congenital midline cleft cyst. On follow-up, the wound showed good healing and the child is asymptomatic.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"We report a case of a 58-year-old Spanish woman resident in New York who presented at our facility with complaints of constipation which had worsened over the past 6 months and onset of hematochezia of a 3 days duration. Her past medical history was statistically significant for schizoaffective disorder and gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Clinical examination revealed a healthy middle-aged woman with a body mass index of 28.1 kg/m2 and normal vital signs. The only abnormal finding on clinical examination was a palpable circumscribed mass compressing on her rectum by digital rectal examination. Her rectum was also filled with hard, pellet-like feces, and altered blood. Blood electrolytes were normal and complete blood count was also normal. Her admitting hematocrit was 46%, and fecal occult blood test was positive. Alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, and ca - 199 tumor markers were all normal. The patient was admitted and serial hematocrit measurements remained within normal limits. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy on the 2nd day of admission showed gastritis.
Pelvic MRI [Figures and ] revealed a 7.5 cm × 5 cm × 6 cm cystic pelvic mass adherent anteriorly to the left lateral wall of the rectum and also adherent to the sacrum posteriorly. There were compression and displacement of the rectal lumen anteriorly and to the right. There was an absence of the uterus from a prior hysterectomy. There was no pelvic sidewall adenopathy or free fluid in the pelvis.
The clinical consideration at this juncture was the possibility of a developmental cyst with low considerations for cystic ovarian or rectal neoplasms due to negative relevant symptomatology and negative tumor markers. A colonoscopy revealed a significant narrowing of the rectum with mucosal erythema and inflammation but no active bleeding. There was no evidence of intra-luminal communication of the tumor.
She underwent an elective surgical excision in which the posterior trans-sacrococcygeal technique was utilized. The patient was positioned in the jackknife position, and a midline incision was made over the coccyx and deepened to the bone with resection of the coccygeal bone. The posterior rectal fat was carefully dissected utilizing both blunt, sharp dissection, and the mass [] was completely excised from surrounding structures. Grossly, the cyst was tan – colored, weighed approximately 0.8 kg and measured 10 cm × 6 cm × 7 cm in its greatest dimension. It contained a cheesy gelatinous material. Intraoperative flexible proctoscopy confirmed an intact rectum. The surgical wound was closed in layers with a size 10 Jackson-pratt drain left in situ. Pathology was compatible with the epidermoid cyst. No coccygeal involvement, no atypia or malignancy was identified on histology. She was subsequently discharged on the third postoperative day following drain removal.

"A 30-year-old male reported to dental O.P. with the complaint of asymmetric appearance of the face. The swelling had been present from childhood and had become evident after puberty. Patient had no history of significant medical problems, trauma or family history of any hereditary disease.
Clinical examination revealed a diffuse enlargement of the lower one-third of the right side of the face. The enlargement was also seen to involve the lower border of the right mandible []. Intra oral examination revealed a swelling involving both the buccal and lingual aspect of the right mandible. The enlargement was more prominent on the buccal side, extending from the distal aspect of 45 to the distal aspect of 47 obliterating the vestibule. On palpation, the enlargement was bony hard in consistency. No sign of inflammation of the overlying mucosa was seen. Intra oral examination revealed an impacted 38 and missing 48 []. Furthermore, observed was that the lesion had not caused any malocclusion [].
Orthopantamogram (OPG) revealed an increase in vertical height of the body of the right mandible of normal bone density. The ramus and condyle of the affected side were normal. An OPG taken at the age of 25 years (5 years back) and the current OPG showed the lesion was stable [].
Computed tomography (CT) axial image revealed a solitary well-defined homogenous mass seen on the right body of the mandible measuring around 2 cm × 3 cm with uniform radiopacity. Bony enlargement was seen on both buccal and lingual side, buccal aspect being more prominent than the contralateral side. The bony enlargement can be well-appreciated in three dimensional (3D) CT. Furthermore observed in the radiographs, the enlargement was restricted to the body and did not extend to the condyle, which later aided in the diagnosis [].
The histopathology showed compact bone and numerous, small marrow spaces. The compact bone exhibited reversal and resting lines with osteoblastic rimming. Osteocytes could also be seen entrapped within the bone [].
Based on the clinical, radiographic and histopathologic findings the diagnosis of hyperplasia of the right mandible was given.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"We present the case of an eight-month-old Hispanic female with feeding refusal, vomiting, and poor growth. Upon presentation, her weight was at the 12th percentile and length was at the 11th percentile for age. Upper gastrointestinal contrast series revealed a congenital antral web. She was evaluated by the pediatric surgeon in Guatemala; however, the family preferred a less invasive approach. Therefore, she was referred to our institution for therapeutic endoscopy.
Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at our institution revealed a small membranous web in the antrum of the stomach, extending inward from the pylorus. Upon initial endoscopy, an Olympus GIF 160 (Olympus Co., Tokyo, Japan) endoscope with an external diameter of 8.6 mm was inserted atraumatically through a bite block and advanced through the esophagus and into the gastric antrum. Here, a congenital antral web measuring approximately 5 to 6 mm in diameter was identified (). Using a gentle torqueing maneuver, the scope was advanced beyond the web to reveal normal mucosa distally. Withdrawing the scope revealed a significant degree of antral web ablation secondary to the initial scope advancement. Controlled radial expansion balloons (CRE; Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) were then used to sequentially dilate the antral web. The balloons were advanced in to the pylorus and gradually expanded first to 9 and 10 mm, then to 11 and 12 mm, then finally to 13.5 and 15 mm for 1 to 2 minutes per session. Upon reaching a diameter of 12 mm, the balloon met resistance and endoscopic visualization through the balloon showed disruption of the mucosa to reveal muscular fibers of the normal pylorus below (). The endoscope was then slowly withdrawn, revealing ablation of the web with no unintended injury (). The patient tolerated the procedure well, and after a period of observation, she was discharged with no significant complications. Upon returning to Guatemala, she underwent a second upper endoscopy with balloon dilation of the pylorus at 13 months of age, from 12 mm up to 15 mm in diameter, without any known complications.
Two years post operatively, follow up revealed continued improved feeding tolerance without recurrence of her symptoms. The patient's weight and height plots also improved from the 11th and 12th percentile respectively at the time of presentation to above the 75th percentile.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 20-year-old Caucasian man was diagnosed with SLE due to polyarthritis, pleuritis, positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA on human epithelial type 2; HEp-2), positive anti-double-stranded DNA, and biopsy-proven class IV glomerulonephritis. Methylprednisolone 1g/day was started for 3 days followed by prednisone 1mg/kg/day. After 1 month, active renal disease persisted and methylprednisolone treatment was repeated. Thereafter, severe pancytopenia and cytomegalovirus infection were identified. Gancyclovir was administered for 21 days with good response. Cyclophosphamide was started (500mg) but after 1 month he presented daily fever and neck pain. At physical examination, an anterior painful cervical prominence was observed; heart rate 122 beats per minute, temperature 37.9°C and oxygen saturation 91%. Piperacillin/tazobactam was started as pulmonary infection was detected. After 2 days, he developed hypoxemia, vascular shock, severe anemia, lymphopenia (300/mm3), and high C-reactive protein (137.5mg/L; normal range, NR, <5). Thyroid ultrasound revealed well-defined hypoechogenic clusters in both lobes. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was suppressed, free thyroxine (T4) >74.6pmol/L (NR 7.7 to 18), total T4 189pmol/dL (NR 90 to 154), total triiodothyronine (T3) 1.15nmol/L (NR 1.23 to 1.85), and high serum thyroglobulin (650.6μg/L). A purulent substance was obtained on fine needle aspiration (FNA) and drained. Cytological analysis showed only pus cells. Thyrotoxicosis due to infectious thyroiditis was established. Fungal culture of thyroid abscess was partial positive. Amphotericin B and fluconazole were introduced. Tracheal and blood cultures were negative. Another thyroid ultrasound revealed persistent small clusters. He underwent drainage again but no secretion was obtained. He died at day 6 of hospital admission with suppressed TSH, lower free T4 but still high (47.6pmol/L) and low total T3 (0.60nmol/L). A culture of thyroid secretion took 10 days to reveal Aspergillus fumigatus, identified by septate hyphae, <5μm in thickness, with branching at acute angles, 2 days after his death.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 57-year-old male patient was transferred to the emergency department after a road traffic accident. He had a fall from his bike and his right arm was crashed by the following car. On clinical examination, he had pain and obvious deformity in the shoulder while he was unable to move his arm in any direction, especially in external rotation. He had numbness in the regimental badge region of the axillary nerve and normal radial pulse at the wrist. Radiological examination showed an anterior shoulder dislocation with impaction of the humeral head underneath glenoid and associated fracture of the greater tuberosity (Fig. ). He had no other skeletal or visceral injuries. After conscious sedation, an effort for closed reduction (3 attempts) was performed in the emergency room but was unsuccessful. For reasons unrelated to the patient or the disease a CT-scan of the shoulder was not possible to be performed at that time. The patient was transferred immediately to the operative theatre for closed manipulation under general anaesthesia in order to reduce the dislocation and avoid further neurological compromise; a CT-scan and/or MRI has been scheduled for the next morning. Despite prompt sedation and muscle relaxation the shoulder was still unable to interpose. Open reduction was accomplished thereafter using the deltopectoral approach; the biceps tendon was found entrapped posterolateral between the humeral head and the tuberosity fragment preventing once again reduction of the glenohumeral joint. (Fig. ). Tenotomy and tenodesis of the frayed biceps at the level of pectoralis major was performed using a bone anchor; the transverse ligament at the bicipital groove had been torned. Next, the subscapularis was incised, 1 cm medial to its insertion at the lesser tubercle, and retracted medially after separated from the capsule. The latter was incised and the labrum was clearly visualized and was found to be intact inferomedially. Using longitudinal traction and finger manipulation in an anterior direction the humeral head was finally reduced revealing a large triangular Hill-Sachs lesion at its posterior part. The greater tuberosity was fixed back to its bed using heavy transosseous sutures (Fig. ). The capsule and subscapularis tendon were repaired anatomically with sutures and the shoulder joint was found stable through a full range of motion of internal rotation and external rotation with the arm in adduction and at 90° of abduction. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery without neurovascular compromise. Pendulum exercises initiated from the second postoperative day followed by passive assisted forward flexion and limitation of active internal rotation for 4 weeks. At the last follow up, one year postoperatively he had a stable joint, full range of motion and a Constant score of 90 (Fig. ).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 30-year-old male patient with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain complaints lasting for a few days presented to our clinic. In his anamnesis, he had several previous abdominal pain attacks which healed themselves. He had not had any abdominal surgery or medicine use before. Clinical examination revealed a tender and distended abdomen. Plain X-ray of the abdomen showed air-fluid levels of small bowel type. On the other hand, abdominal CT revealed dilatation and wall thickness in the terminal ileum (). No abnormality was observed in laboratory parameters. An exploratory surgery with a laparotomy method was decided with “acute mechanical intestinal obstruction” prediagnosis. During the laparotomy, a cocoon-like fibrous tissue of about 20 cm diameter was observed around the ileum. Small bowel was relieved through cutting the fibrous membrane. Since the circulation was normal in bowel segment, no resection was made. The patient was discharged on the fourth day after the operation.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 14-year-old girl with an uneventful clinical history suddenly developed a severe syndrome characterized by intermittent-remittent fever with spikes up to 41℃, headache, meningismus, drowsiness, myalgia, and arthralgia without arthritis. A mild liver and spleen enlargement was present.
Routine investigations showed increased acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], levels of 90 mm/h; C-reactive protein [CRP], 14.7 mg/dl), anemia [hemoglobin 9.6 g/dl], total white cell count 6.4 × 103/µL, thrombocytopenia [128 × 103/µL], and liver involvement [aspartate transaminase 322 UI/L, alanine transaminase 485 UI/L, and γ-GT 295 UI/L]). Serology for some hepatotropic viruses (i.e. hepatitis viruses A-B-C, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus) was negative. The autoantibody panel showed a slight autoantibody positivity of anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA) (1:40) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) with an atypical pattern.
Due to the increased transaminase and γ-GT plasma levels a liver biopsy was performed with the results being consistent with a non-specific hepatitis pattern. Moreover, brain MRI, cerebrospinal fluid analysis and bacterial culture ruled out encephalo-meningitis; bone marrow biopsy and bone scintigraphy were also negative. Antibiotics treatment (amoxicillin-clavulanate 90 mg/kg/day three times a day) was started without significant clinical response. Since fever spikes and myalgia/arthralgia persisted, the girl was admitted to our department 30 days after disease onset.
At admission, the patient complained of recurrent fever spikes and severe malaise, although according to the parents’ opinion the general conditions of the girl had been ameliorated. Laboratory investigations showed positive acute phase reactants (ESR 75 mm/h and CRP 3.9 mg/dl), hypergammaglobulinemia (1.73 g/dl) with increased IgM (241 mg/dl) and IgA (490 mg/dl) plasma concentrations: notably, transaminase activities were normal with persistently increased γ-GT 114 UI/L. As a diagnosis had not yet been reached, we performed a WB-MRI on a 1.5 T MRI scanner (Achieva Intera; Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) using body coil with a field of view covering from head to toes. WB-MRI images were acquired (and displayed) in coronal plane using a turbo spin echo T1-weighted (T1W) sequence (TR, 630 ms; TE, 17 ms; slice thickness, 5 mm; gap, 0.5 mm; NSA, 1) and a turbo spin echo STIR sequence (TR, 2800 ms; TE, 165 ms; TI, 64 ms; slice thickness, 5 mm; gap, 0.5 mm; NSA, 3). Total scan time was about 30 min. No contrast medium was administered during the examination.
The MR investigation was carried out with the aim to rule out hemato-oncologic diseases and occult abscess. Surprisingly the WB-MRI showed an unusual pattern characterized by millimetric, widespread punctate nodules, respectively hypo-hyperintense in T1W and STIR sequences. These nodules were mainly localized in the meta-epiphyseal regions of the long bones of both legs (mostly at the level of the distal femur and proximal tibia) as further documented by an additional dedicated MRI of both knees (, , , and ). According to the radiologist’s opinion, these images were possibly related to a hematologic intramedullary spread of an infectious process or to a post-infectious thrombotic microangiopathy.
Upon this finding, and taking into account the apparent self-limiting disease course and the rural area where the patient lived, further investigations were conducted to rule out zoonosis. Serologic assay of anti-Anaplasma phagocytophilum showed an IgM titer of 1:40 (positive, >1:64) and an IgG titer of 1:160 (positive, >1:64). Hence intravenous ceftriaxone treatment (80 mg/kg daily) was started with a prompt clinical improvement (i.e. disappearance of fever, myalgia, malaise, and headache). The patient has not had a relapse after about 1 year of treatment.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 73-year-old right-handed AA woman with a known history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease presented to the UAB emergency room with shortness of breath, lower extremity edema, and confusion. There was no travel history, and contact exposure to COVID-19 was unknown. A significant past neurological history included surgical repair of left frontal skull base ethmoidal encephalocele and ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus. At presentation, she had an axillary temperature of 90.6 F, heart rate of 44 beats per minute, blood pressure of 86/71 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. There was no focal neurological weakness or neck stiffness, but she had diminished level of consciousness. Chest X-ray demonstrated patchy bilateral opacities and serum procalcitonin (0.53 ng/mL) was elevated. She was admitted to the intensive care unit with the diagnosis of sepsis. The next morning, bedside nurses noticed persistent face and arm myoclonus with worsening altered mental status that was concerning for status epilepticus. Scalp EEG showed marked background voltage attenuation and slowing, continuous 0.5-0.75 Hz bilateral independent periodic discharges (BIPDs) over the left and right hemisphere that evolved to form recurrent (approx. 5/hour) discrete seizures emanating from either right or left fronto-central-parietal regions (Figs. , ). Myoclonic status epilepticus with coma (MSE) was diagnosed and treated with intravenous levetiracetam, lacosamide, phenytoin, and midazolam to achieve burst suppression for 48 hours. Four days later, the EEG improved significantly with the cessation of epileptiform activity. However, clinically she worsened with multi-organ failure requiring blood transfusions and hemodialysis. Tracheal aspirate tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Due to a strict isolation policy to minimize the spread of COVID-19, the MRI brain was not obtained. Instead, a CT brain and perfusion study were performed a day after the MSE ceased, and it did not reveal any abnormality that could explain the etiology of MSE. For the next 3 weeks, multiple attempts to arouse or extubate failed after sedatives were held. Care was withdrawn, and the patient expired.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 67-year-old female with NF1 presented with lumbago, cold sweats, and sudden onset weakness, which necessitated an emergency transfer to our institution. She had no significant past medical history, was negative for hypertension, and was on no regular medications. She was hypotensive (systolic blood pressure = 60 mmHg) and tachycardic on arrival. An abdominal contrast computed tomography (CT) scan showed a rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with communication between the aneurysm and the inferior vena cava (IVC) (Fig. a, b). The maximum dimensions of the ruptured AAA and IVC were 34 mm and 37 mm, respectively. The aortic rupture was located 7.5 cm distal to the renal artery and 2.5 cm proximal to the bifurcation of the aorta (Fig. c). Due to the difficulty of primarily closing the ruptured IVC, we planned an endovascular treatment to control the bleeding from the IVC by exclusion of the ruptured AAA. The diameter of normal proximal aorta was 16 mm, which was too narrow to place a normal Y-shaped graft. Moreover, there was insufficient time to prepare another stent in emergency. Therefore, we instead deployed an ENDURANTII (Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, CA, USA) iliac extension proximal to the terminal aorta that was long enough to insert three or more stents (Fig. d). As the bleeding from the AAA and the communication between the aneurysm and the IVC were not well controlled, we placed an EXCLUDER (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) cuff in the ENDURANTII iliac extension. Although a type IV endoleak was detected on angiography, the patient’s hemodynamics stabilized. We therefore decided to conclude the operation at this point and re-assess the endoleak in a few days.
An abdominal contrast CT performed 3 days after the operation showed a type Ib endoleak and injury to the distal abdominal aorta (Fig. a). This led to a redo-EVAR 4 days after operation. This included deploying an AFX (Endologix, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) graft, as well as an infrarenal cuff, as the AFX head did not fit exactly within the stent placed in the primary operation. We also performed coil embolization treatment of the left internal iliac artery aneurysm (Fig. b), which was identified initially (Fig. b). We confirmed no endoleak at the final angiography. An abdominal contrast CT performed 18 days after the primary operation showed two new sequential aneurysms of the LCA, which were not previously detected. Coil embolization was planned to address these new aneurysms.
Twenty-two days after primary operation, however, the patient presented with new onset nausea, left abdominal pain, and hypotension. Her systolic blood pressure was 50 mmHg. She was resuscitated and required vasopressor support. Laboratory tests, including leukocyte count and electrolytes, were normal. The serum C-reactive protein and D-dimer were elevated to 0.37 mg/dl (normal range 0.01–0.30) and 6.8 μg/ml (normal range 0.0–1.0), respectively. We considered potential bleeding from nearby arteries, including the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and lumbar artery [, ]. An abdominal contrast CT showed enlargement of LCA aneurysms and surrounding hematoma (Fig. a–c), establishing the diagnosis of rupture of the LCA aneurysms. Emergency exploratory surgery was performed.
We gained access through a midline abdominal incision. Active bleeding was encountered intraperitoneally and controlled with compression. As a result of the patient’s initial AAA rupture, residual hematoma was present, which extended along the entire left abdomen and retroperitoneum (Fig. a). In addition, the AAA stent endograft had resulted in a left laterally displaced aorta, narrowing our operative field. Due to her distorted anatomy, active bleeding, and clinical condition, we elected to perform a left hemicolectomy. We divided the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) 3 cm distal to the IMA root to not to injure the recently repaired aorta. We divided the colon at the rectosigmoid junction. Proximally, we divided the colon at the middle of the transverse colon (Fig. b). The mesentery was divided to include the LCA aneurysms. Given her clinical condition, we elected to not perform a colorectal anastomosis, but instead performed a Hartmann’s procedure with an end transverse colon colostomy. The surgery took 145 min, and the estimated blood loss was 4.5 L. Packed red blood cell transfusion volume was approximately 1.96 L, and fresh frozen plasma volume was 1.44 L.
In reviewing the specimens, a 2-cm aneurysmal sac and 1-cm aneurysmal sac were identified in the LCA. No thrombus was identified (Fig. a, b). No ischemic changes and no tumor were observed in the excised colon (Fig. c). Interestingly, fibrous tissue around the left colic artery stained positive for S-100 protein, suggesting that neurofibroma from NF1 might have been associated with the rupture of these aneurysms due to weakened integrity of the vascular walls (Fig. a–e). A follow-up abdominal CT showed no recurrence of the endoleak. The patient was discharged 37 days after the last operation without any other post-operative complications.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 60-year-old man developed pain in the left eye 3 days prior to his first visit. At the ophthalmological consultation, he negated any previous disorders, except a history of migraine, and was not taking any prescription medication. The patient displayed a slight exophthalmos of the left eye. BCVA was 0.8 in the right eye and 1.0 in his left eye. A fundus examination revealed a normal optic disc and retina in both eyes. The patient did not receive any treatment except tear substitution eye drops. Laboratory testing included determination of hemoglobin (HGB), glucose, C-reactive protein (CRP), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine (T4), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and results from all tests were normal. An orbital MRI with and without intravenous contrast carried out 3 weeks later revealed moderately increased signal intensity in the optical nerve sheaths, especially on the left side, in line with what is seen in OPN. The MRI also showed increased signaling in the retrobulbar fat. No swelling of the extraocular muscles was evident.
The eye pain had subsided at a new visit 2 months after the initial consultation. Visual acuity was measured 2, 5, and 12 months after the first visit; corrected visual acuity was 1.0 in both eyes on these examinations. Visual field and color vision tests were normal on all three follow-up examinations. Fundus examinations were performed on all three visits and did not reveal anything abnormal.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"Patient (9): is a 2.5 year old girl, the youngest sister of patient (7 and 8). Her height was 90 cm and her weight was 8.5 Kg and skull circumference was 42 cm. She had bilateral cataract that was extracted at the age of 1.5 years and cerebellar ataxia. Abdominal examination revealed mildly enlarged liver which was palpable 2 cm below the costal margin. Her chest and heart examination were clinically free. Abdominal ultrasound showed no abnormalities apart from the mildly enlarged liver. ALT was 101 IU/L (normal = 40), AST was 49 IU/L (normal = 37) and GGT was 27 U/L (normal = 50). Although bilirubin level in this family was normal, GGT was mildly increased in patient (8).

"A 12-year-old girl presented to her general pediatrician complaining of asthenia and weight loss in the previous month. Her past medical and family history were unremarkable. Physical examination revealed a painless hepato-splenomegaly without additional clinical signs. Abdominal ultrasound revealed an inhomogeneous liver appearance, abdominal lymphadenopathy and a hypo-echogenic solid neoformation in front of the celiac artery (35 × 13 mm). The patient was admitted to the Department of Pediatrics of the Meyer Children’s Hospital for further diagnostic investigations.
Physical examination revealed palpable spleen and liver, a right inguinal lymph node of 1 cm and a lymph node in supraclavicular location, without any further objective anomaly. She had no fever. Initial laboratory tests found microcytic iron deficiency anemia (Hb = 9.8 g/dl, MCV = 65.5 ft., Ferritin = 4 ng/ml), with normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), normal total protein and protein electrophoresis, a slight increase of lipase and colic acids with normal amylase. Blood biochemistry for kidney and liver function and urinalysis were normal. Primary immunologic work-up including lymphocyte subset and immunoglobulin levels were normal. Tests for malignancies (tumor markers and peripheral blood smear) and infectious investigations, including Mantoux Test and IGRA Assay resulted negative.
Chest X-ray was negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination of the superior and inferior abdomen with contrast medium confirmed increased liver dimensions and its structural inhomogeneity with zones of signal alteration: some nodular, other confluent. It also revealed increased spleen size with zones of nodular signal alteration and multiple nodular formations in the following locations: hepatic hilar, mesenteric, lombo-aortic, at the retrocavity of the epiploon, and the greatest one in front of the celiac artery (diameter > 3.5 cm).
Suspecting a systemic lymphoproliferative disease, we performed liver and lymph node ultrasound-guided biopsy, which showed negativity of Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for potential agents of infectious diseases (including Mycobacteria and Bartonella species) on lymph node material, while it highlighted a non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, resembling sarcoidosis, and aspects of non-specific inflammation of the liver. (Fig. , ).
Subsequently, we carried out measurements of serum and urinary calcium, serum phosphorus, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE), followed by a complete cardiac evaluation, and a complete ophthalmologic evaluation (including slit lamp), all of which resulted within normality.
At this point, given the biopsy results, we performed further lung studies: pulmonary function tests which showed mild restriction and decreased alveolar capillary diffusion. The chest X-Ray revaluation revealed a pattern compatible with mild fibrosis and enlarged lymph nodes. We decided to carry out a high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT), which showed widespread fibrous strands and multiple enlarged lymph nodes (right paratracheal area, at the supraaortic trunk origin, subcarinal, with the largest in this location measuring 30 × 17 mm, pericardiophrenic, bilaterally at axillary level and along the mammary vessels). The bronchoscopic investigation with analysis of the broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid revealed: macrophages 70%, neutrophils 4% and lymphocytes 26% with a CD4/CD8 ratio of 9.2 (pathological value > 3.5).
Based on these results, we carried out further investigations on liver tissue and lymph node with histochemical techniques: CD68 + nodules were found, suggestive of microgranulomas (Fig. and ).
Having ruled out other diagnoses, with suggestive histological findings in two different tissues (liver and lymph nodes) and considering lung involvement, we made the diagnosis of pediatric-onset adult sarcoidosis.
During hospitalization, the condition of the child had always been good and she had always been afebrile. Considering lymph node hypertrophy and the signs of initial portal hypertension (due to compression of the hepatic vessels), we started therapy with prednisone 40 mg/day, and subsequent cross-therapy with mycophenolate mofetil (250 mg/m2 increasing up to 1 g/m2).
The girl came back to our attention a month after discharge for a follow-up visit: she was found in good general condition, with hepatomegaly and without other clinical signs or symptoms. A brain MRI was performed in order to rule out cerebral involvement and it revealed normal findings. One year later she maintained good clinical condition and normal laboratory tests, therefore MMF was gradually reduced and definitively suspended after 18 months. Now her periodic follow up consist of clinical and laboratory evaluation every 6 months and annual pulmonary function tests, unless clinical or laboratory new findings.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"The patient was a 58-year-old woman suffering from lower abdominal pain and vomiting, which gradually worsened from the start of December 2017. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed multiple gastric ulcers and scars, and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed inflammation in the large intestine. The patient had undergone surgery in 1997 for cervical carcinoma, followed by postoperative radiotherapy that involved irradiation of her pelvis and stomach. On the basis of the symptoms, endoscopy findings, and medical history, the patient was diagnosed with refractory multiple gastric ulcers, enterocolitis, and paralytic ileus due to late radiation-induced sequelae.
As a result of frequent vomiting, the patient had become unable to ingest orally. She was hospitalized in October 2018 and fasted before being placed under central venous nutrition control. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was started to treat the intractable multiple gastric ulcers and ileus. Thirty treatment sessions were scheduled over a period of approximately 1–2 months. Pentazocine and tramadol were administered to treat the abdominal pain, but these achieved poor results.
At hospitalization, the patient was 155 cm tall and weighed 43 kg. Although she exhibited abdominal distention, no muscular defense or rebound pain was observed. On percussion, the bowel sound was attenuated. A blood examination revealed anemia, slight liver dysfunction, low protein levels, and hypoalbuminemia. An abdominal X-ray showed several small intestinal niveau and extension of the colon and small intestine by intestinal gas (Fig. a).
The patient experienced increased lower abdominal pain during bowel movements and felt relieved after defecation. Consequently, we hypothesized that her abdominal pain was due to poor peristalsis of the intestinal tract and that blocking the sympathetic nerve of the intestinal tract would help normalize the peristaltic movement and relieve the pain. The pain was strongest in the lower abdomen at the level of the 12th thoracic nerve. An epidural catheter was inserted via the lumbar1–2 intervertebral space, and continuous epidural anesthesia with 0.2% ropivacaine at 4 ml/h was administered for 1 week, resulting in good control of the lower abdominal pain and defecation. This allowed the tramadol, which promotes constipation, to be discontinued. A block of the inferior mesenteric artery plexus with ethanol was performed, resulting in an immediate improvement in the patient’s bowel movements and defecation, and a reduction in lower abdominal pain, now measured as 3 on a numerical rating scale (NRS = 3). An abdominal X-ray was performed after the block procedure, showing the number of intestinal niveau and the amount of gas had decreased, as compared to that before the block (Fig. b). The control of lower abdominal pain was effective, and defecation was noted. Tube feeding was started 4 days after the inferior mesenteric artery plexus block, and oral feeding was started 2 days later.
Twelve days after the block, the patient’s lower abdominal pain increased to NRS 8 and there was recrudescence of the vomiting. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed dilation of the small intestine, as well as the formation of niveau; however, no bowel obstruction or disruption of blood flow was observed (Fig. a).
An upper gastrointestinal contrast examination with contrast medium (Gastrografin®, Bayer Yakuhin Ltd., Osaka, Japan) showed relatively good peristaltic movement of the large and small intestine but poor gastric peristaltic movement. A large amount of food residue was also observed. An epidural catheter was inserted via the thoracic 6–7 intervertebral space for innervation of the upper gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach and small intestine, and continuous epidural anesthesia with 0.2% ropivacaine at 4 ml/h was started. This alleviated the abdominal pain, and the vomiting disappeared.
Approximately 2 weeks later, continuous epidural anesthesia was stopped, and a splanchnic nerve block with ethanol was performed (Fig. c). This resulted in an improvement in the lower abdominal pain to NRS 1, as well as an increase in food intake. The following day, CT showed a large improvement in the ileus (Fig. b). An upper gastrointestinal contrast examination showed that peristaltic movement of the upper gastrointestinal tract had improved (Fig. ). The subsequent course was good, and the hyperbaric oxygen therapy was completed. The patient was discharged from hospital at the end of January. At the outpatient visit 2 weeks later, the general condition of the patient was good and she could orally intake her normal diet.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

Laboratory investigations showed positive acute phase reactants (ESR 75 mm/h and CRP 3.9 mg/dl), hypergammaglobulinemia (1.73 g/dl) with increased IgM (241 mg/dl) and IgA (490 mg/dl) plasma concentrations: notably, transaminase activities were normal with persistently increased γ-GT 114 UI/L. As a diagnosis had not yet been reached, we performed a WB-MRI on a 1.5 T MRI scanner (Achieva Intera; Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) using body coil with a field of view covering from head to toes. WB-MRI images were acquired (and displayed) in coronal plane using a turbo spin echo T1-weighted (T1W) sequence (TR, 630 ms; TE, 17 ms; slice thickness, 5 mm; gap, 0.5 mm; NSA, 1) and a turbo spin echo STIR sequence (TR, 2800 ms; TE, 165 ms; TI, 64 ms; slice thickness, 5 mm; gap, 0.5 mm; NSA, 3). Total scan time was about 30 min. No contrast medium was administered during the examination.
The MR investigation was carried out with the aim to rule out hemato-oncologic diseases and occult abscess. Surprisingly the WB-MRI showed an unusual pattern characterized by millimetric, widespread punctate nodules, respectively hypo-hyperintense in T1W and STIR sequences. These nodules were mainly localized in the meta-epiphyseal regions of the long bones of both legs (mostly at the level of the distal femur and proximal tibia) as further documented by an additional dedicated MRI of both knees (, , , and ). According to the radiologist’s opinion, these images were possibly related to a hematologic intramedullary spread of an infectious process or to a post-infectious thrombotic microangiopathy.
Upon this finding, and taking into account the apparent self-limiting disease course and the rural area where the patient lived, further investigations were conducted to rule out zoonosis. Serologic assay of anti-Anaplasma phagocytophilum showed an IgM titer of 1:40 (positive, >1:64) and an IgG titer of 1:160 (positive, >1:64). Hence intravenous ceftriaxone treatment (80 mg/kg daily) was started with a prompt clinical improvement (i.e. disappearance of fever, myalgia, malaise, and headache). The patient has not had a relapse after about 1 year of treatment.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 69-year-old male with past medical history of hypertension, asthma, coronary artery
disease, end-stage renal disease secondary to hypertensive glomerulosclerosis s/p
deceased donor kidney transplant 4 months back presented to the hospital with
productive cough, fever, and anorexia of 2 weeks duration. Vitals on presentation
were temperature of 38.5°C, heart rate of 72/min, blood pressure of 167/62 mm Hg,
and respiratory rate of 22/min with oxygen saturation between 90% and 92% on room
air. On physical examination, he had bibasilar crackles, more prominent on the left.
Laboratory findings revealed an elevated white blood cell count of 15 100/µL, blood
urea nitrogen of 21, and creatinine of 1.9 (baseline creatinine of 1.9-2.0).
Urinalysis was unremarkable. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed a left lower lobe
consolidation. Pan cultures were obtained, and treatment was started with
intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for empiric coverage. His
posttransplant immunosuppressive regimen of mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and
prednisone was continued along with other supportive measures. His prophylactic
medications of nystatin, valganciclovir, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)
were discontinued 4 weeks prior to admission after completion of 3-month
posttransplant prophylaxis course. On day 3, 1 out of the 4 blood cultures grew
gram-positive bacilli for which ampicillin was added for better central nervous
system (CNS) penetration to cover Listeria infection as well. The
computed tomography (CT) scan of head and lumbar puncture ruled out any CNS
involvement. On day 7, final report of the blood culture revealed weakly acid-fast
filamentous gram-positive bacteria. On further review of the gram stain and colony
morphology of the organisms, it was identified as Nocardia. The
diagnosis of disseminated nocardiosis secondary to pulmonary source (left lower lobe
pneumonia) was made. Treatment for Nocardia was initiated with
imipenem/cilastatin, and initial antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam,
and ampicillin) were discontinued. Despite changing the antibiotics, there was no
significant improvement in his overall clinical condition, and the patient remained
with supplemental oxygen–dependent, persistent cough and with productive phlegm.
Speciation of the organism was consistent with Nocardia
transvalensis, which was resistant to imipenem, bactrim, ceftriaxone,
augmentin, and minocycline. It was reported to be sensitive to linezolid, amikacin,
moxifloxacin, clarithromycin, and tobramycin. Imipenem/cilastatin was discontinued,
and linezolid along with moxifloxacin was initiated on day 14. Within the next 3
days, the patient started showing signs of improvement and was discharged home in a
stable condition. He took linezolid 300 mg daily and moxifloxacin 400 mg daily for
12 months and remained asymptomatic. His follow-up visits were uneventful, and the
patient was asymptomatic. Repeat CXR at the follow-up visit showed resolution of the
pneumonia.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 58-year-old woman was newly diagnosed with advance (T3N1M0) moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of distal esophagus involving gastroesophageal junction. She received her first cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy Carboplatin and Paclitaxel. The next day, she presented to the emergency room with two episodes of hematemesis containing fresh blood. In addition to that she had progressive dysphagia for solids. She remained hemodynamically stable. The Rockall et al. score was 2, owing to the disseminated esophageal malignancy. Her blood reports showed a hemoglobin drop of 2.6 g from 13.1 to 10.5 mg/dL. The platelet count and coagulation profile were within the normal range along with the liver and renal functions also being unremarkable. After initial resuscitation, patient was made nil by mouth and started on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) infusion. After taking informed written consent, an upper GI endoscopy was done. The findings revealed a stenosing non-traversable tumor, starting at 33 cm from the incisors, containing old clotted blood as well as mild oozing, as shown in . Initially, an attempt was made to maintain hemostasis using conventional methods including adrenaline injection and hemospray, but this was unsuccessful for this purpose. In view of the stenosing tumor and ongoing bleed despite using the aforementioned measures, it was decided there and then to place a temporary 20 mm × 130 mm FCSEMS (nitinol). This would not only help to achieve luminal patency but would also aid in bleeding control due to the tamponade effect. Using a catheter, a guidewire was passed through the stricture and its position confirmed fluoroscopically, as shown in . An FCSEMS was deployed over the guidewire under both direct vision and fluoroscopic guidance, which is shown in and , respectively. No further episodes of hematemesis or melena were observed along with no further hemoglobin drop. Patient stayed for 72 h in the hospital and was later discharged with a follow-up plan for stent removal at 2 weeks. Patient, however, was lost to follow-up with the GI team but continued to have chemotherapy and radiation therapy. She was sent back for esophageal stent removal after 5 months. Esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD) revealed no bleed from tumor, stent was removed, and scope was passed freely across the tumor, as shown in . Patient followed up notes of radiation oncology clinics confirmed no episodes of upper GI bleed between the time of stent insertion and removal. No stent-related early and late complications were seen.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 58-year-old female patient, who was a known case of hypertension and hypothyroidism taking tablet L-thyroxine 50 mcg once a day and tablet metoprolol 25 mg twice a day regularly presented on 17th April 2020 with chief complaints of low-grade intermittent fever, generalized body ache, running nose and soreness of throat for last 3 days. Her reverse transcriptase by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 was done at Civil hospital, which returned positive. Her husband was also symptomatic for COVID-19 and was also tested positive. Both were admitted in Civil hospital on 19/4/2020. Her chest laboratory parameters including complete blood count and X-ray were normal []. She was treated with azithromycin 500 mg once a day for 3 days along with paracetamol 500 mg thrice daily apart from multivitamins. Patient became asymptomatic after 2 days. Her repeat RT-PCR for COVID-19 was done on 28th and 29th April 2020 which both returned negative after which she was discharged on 29th April 2020. Her husband had COVID-19 pneumonia for which he remained hospitalized in civil hospital for 23 days and was subsequently discharged on her regular medication for hypertension and hypothyroidism at home. She was asymptomatic for almost next 4 months.
On 17th August 2020, she again developed symptoms in form of intermittent 101°F fever, generalized body ache, dry cough, and throat pain. Her rapid antigen test (RAT) returned positive. Her husband was negative on this occasion. Patient needed rehospitalisation on 19th August 2020 where her RT PCR for COVID-19 also returned positive with cycle threshold (CT score) of 18 suggestive of high viral load, thus confirming a case of reinfection with COVID-19. Total antibody and immunoglobulin G antibody test for COVID-19 were negative suggestive of non-existent immunoglobulin memory from previous COVID-19 infection. Her inflammatory profile revealed CRP of 17.8 mg/L and IL-6 of 15.4 pg/ml with otherwise normal X-ray chest (shown below) and other reports.

"A 55-year-old male with a past medical history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastritis, presented to our emergency department via ambulance with a chief complaint of lightheadedness, associated with nausea and vomiting. The patient reported feeling lightheaded two hours prior to arrival, along with nausea and three episodes of non-bloody emesis. The patient underwent cardiac ablation one month prior for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He denied chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, syncope, weakness, numbness, or tingling. He received 324 mg of aspirin en route. On physical exam, his heart rate was significantly elevated at 191 beats per minute, and he was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 61/57 mmHg. His pulse oximetry was 98% on room air, and he was afebrile.
The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) showed wide complex tachycardia (WCT) (Figure ). Since the patient was hypotensive, and therefore hemodynamically unstable, the decision was made to cardiovert the patient with informed consent. The patient was successfully cardioverted with 100 joules (J) of electricity on a biphasic device.
The patient’s heart rate improved to 89 beats per minute following the cardioversion, and his blood pressure normalized (Figure ). The patient was no longer lightheaded and nauseated. The patient’s troponin came back at 0.01 ng/mL (normal), he did not have any electrolyte abnormalities or anemia. His thyroid-stimulating hormone level was also normal.
The patient was admitted for cardiac workup, and started on flecainide and nebivolol (a beta1 selective blocker) by the cardiologist then discharged home. The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout his hospital stay.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 58-year-old female presented with a chief complaint of left hip pain of 5 months’ duration. The patient had been seen approximately 10 months prior to presentation, shortly after experiencing a “clunk” in her right hip. She reported that her pain was stable and had not increased since that episode. Relevant history included a left primary THA approximately 25 years ago. The patient also reported a right primary THA at the age of 33 years, followed by a head and liner exchange 10 years later due to poly wear and broken tine. A right total knee arthroplasty procedure was performed approximately 1 year ago. Comorbid conditions reported included degenerative joint disease, thrombocytopenia, cirrhosis of the liver, lumbar spondylosis and anemia. The patient had been managing any ongoing hip pain with anti-inflammatories and routine monitoring of poly wear with annual radiographs.
On physical examination, a pain-free range of motion (ROM) of the affected hip was noted, although the patient demonstrated hesitation at the extremes of motion. Slightly reduced ROM was noted with internal and external rotation when compared with the right hip. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were normal. Radiographs were obtained and revealed severe polyethylene wear and asymmetry in the left hip (). Some acetabular and proximal femoral lysis was noted, although there was no change in the acetabulofemoral component interface.
The pre-operative plan for this patient was to exchange the polyethylene liner only; however, during surgery, it was observed that the locking mechanism on the poly component was incompetent. Furthermore, intraoperative measurement with the navigation system indicated anteversion of 5° (radiographic definition), revealing a cup component significantly more retroverted than the 18° indicated by the pre-operative radiograph (). A decision was made to exchange both the liner and the cup component ().
Surgery was successful, and post-operatively, the patient was prescribed standard posterior hip precautions with toe-touch weight-bearing for 6 weeks. At 2 weeks post-op, the patient was progressing well.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 54-year-old healthy male, presented with multiple, variably sized, nonhealing ulcers over his right lower leg since 3 months. It started as a single coin-sized ulcer over the shin, which rapidly increased in size with the simultaneous appearance of multiple new similar lesions and swelling over the right leg. The patient had received multiple courses of oral and intravenous antibiotics despite of which his disease was progressing. There was no history of apparent trauma or evidence of an immunocompromised state. History of excursion to Amazon rain forest 1-month prior to the onset of ulceration was present.
Cutaneous examination revealed irregularly shaped ulcers ranging in size from pinpoint to 9 cm × 5 cm, covered with seropurulent slough [] distributed nonlinearly over the extensor aspect of the right leg. Few of them were herpetiform in morphology. The involved limb presented a cellulitic picture with diffuse erythema and induration. There was no evidence of any preceding nodulation. A single thickened lymphatic cord was palpable on the medial aspect of the thigh in the later course of his disease.
All the hematological and biochemical investigations were normal except for a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (45 mm/h). Magnetic resonance imaging lower leg showed findings consistent with cellulitis with no deep extension, abscess, osteomyelitis, or muscular involvement.
Histopathology and tissue culture samples were sent with a differential diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum, mycobacterial infection, cutaneous leishmaniasis, and deep fungal infection. Repeated cultures for the same were negative. Histopathology revealed multiple, poorly formed, epithelioid cell granulomas along with diffuse infiltrates of lympho-histiocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils in the deeper dermis. Special stain (periodic acid-Schiff [PAS] and Gomori Methenamine silver stain) showed small budding and occasional elongated yeast cells in the dermis []. PAS stain from tissue imprints revealed cigar-shaped bodies suggesting Sprorothrix infection.
Patient was started on itraconazole capsules 200 mg twice daily monotherapy, with only marginal response. He developed multiple subcutaneous nodules and an ulcer over the right thigh even after 6 weeks of treatment. Thus, saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI) was added with complete clearance of the lesions in 10 weeks.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

Hepatitis A virus IgM, HBsAg, HBcAb IgM, hepatitis C virus antibodies were negative; CMV, EBV and rubella (IgG and IgM) were also negative. Plasma aminoacids revealed a mild elevation of methionine: 1.3 mg/dl (normal < 0.8) and an elevation of methionine/phenylalanine ratio: 1.41 (normal < 1.0). Acylcarnitine profile was normal. Total galactose (galactose and galactose 1- phosphate combined): 1.7 mg/dl (normal <15). Galactose 1- phosphate uridyle transferase was: 71.2 uM (normal >60). DNA testing for galactosemia mutation revealed no copies of the Q188r, S135L, K285N, or L195P (classical galactosemia) or N314D (Duarte galactosemia).
Slit lamp examination revealed clear corneas and lens. Fundus examination showed pigments around the disc (bilateral retinal dystrophy). CT brain revealed central and cortical involutional brain changes. MRI brain revealed mild prominence of the brain sulci, fissures and basal cisterns with mildly dilated ventricular system more appreciated at the cerebellar hemispheres with mildly prominent cerebellar fissures. This is in addition to evidence of dysmyelinating process in the form of periventricular hyperintensity. Nerve conduction velocity and EMG showed normal studies.
The patient received ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day, vitamin E (100 mg/day), aldactone (2 mg/kg/day), vitamin K (10 mg/day) and albumin transfusion. She gradually improved over one month and was discharged from the hospital on aldactone (12.5 mg/12 hrs) and vitamin K (10 mg once daily). Her investigations on discharge were: total bilirubin: 3.6 mg/dl, direct bilirubin: 2.1 mg/dl, albumin: 4 g/dl, AST: 54 IU/L, ALT: 100 IU/L, and normal PT.

"A 70-year-old man patient weighing 55 kg was admitted to emergency department with a complaint of severe weakness, lightheadedness, and lower limb paresthesia. Before this admission, he also presented worsening of symptoms in the last two weeks. He had no family history of cardiovascular disease, sudden cardiac death, or syncope.
On admission, hemodynamic parameters were in acceptable condition. He had blood pressure of 79/99 mmHg, heart rate of 57 beats/minute, and respiratory rate of 20 breath/minute, and he was also afebrile. Oxygen saturation, at rest, with finger pulse oximeter in index finger was 95%.
Primary physical examination was also done and we found the S4 sound in the apex, in cardiac auscultation. He was in class 2 of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification. Laboratory findings showed a mild hypochromic microcytic anemia [hemoglobin = 10.9 g/dl, hematocrit = 30.3%, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) = 73.09 fl, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) = 21.67 pg]. He had degrees of hypothyroidism with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) of 20 mU/l and serum thyroxine (T4) of 2.4 µg/dl.
Electrocardiography (ECG) showed right bundle branch block (RBBB) with right axis deviation and complete atrioventricular block that diagnosed as a Trifascicular block ().
The patient referred to echocardiography unit and transthoracic echocardiography showed a moderate increase in thickness of left ventricular (LV) wall as a concentric pattern and LV diastolic dysfunction (grade 2). The ejection fraction of LV (LVEF) was 55%. Echocardiography revealed normal right ventricle size and function as well [tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) = 1.9 cm] (). Cardiac biomarkers revealed that troponin I was negative with elevated N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP) equal to 288 pg/ml.
Regard to severe weakness and paresthesia, he referred to neurology department for electrodiagnostic study. The electrodiagnostic evaluation revealed absent sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) with low amplitude compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) of upper and lower limbs. These findings were compatible with chronic sensory-motor polyneuropathy with axonal features, and evidence of ongoing axonal loss.
According to the sustained anemic situation and severe weakness, the patient underwent bone marrow aspiration. Microscopic evaluation of bone marrow aspiration revealed elevated cellularity with myeloid hyperplasia to erythroid hypoplasia ratio of 3:1, and complete maturation. Plasma cells were 22% of all nucleated cells. This finding was compatible with plasma cell myeloma.
Laboratory investigations including serum and urine electrophoresis and serum free light chain examination as immunofixation assay were also done. The results showed that kappa (κ) chains predominated over lambda (λ) chains in a ratio of 3:2. The hepatic test showed elevated alkaline phosphatase value equal to 215 U/l.
Ultimately, by considering all clinical aspects and paraclinical investigations mentioned above, final diagnosis for the patient was amyloid light-chain (AL) cardiac amyloidosis.
Immediately, the targeted therapy was established. Regarding clinical and paraclinical parameters, the patient received melphalan combined with high-dose dexamethasone. Concurrently, immunotherapeutic strategy with CPHPC and monoclonal antibodies were also prescribed. The patient closely monitored for 2 weeks and during this treatment period, he showed hematologic and organ response to the therapy. After this period, kappa to lambda ratio in urine immunofixation electrophoresis was normal, and serum level had a negative result. Heart response included no change in normal left ventricular ejection fraction (55 %), enhance the NYHA class of 2 to 1 without using any medications such as diuretic, and no wall thickness enhancement. NT-ProBNP was in normal range (100 pg/ml). The hepatic test revealed that alkaline phosphatase value had a dramatic decrease in 101 U/l (more than 50%).

"A 12-year-old boy with a large retroperitoneal sarcoma with bilateral obstructive uropathy was planned for bilateral ureteric stenting. His preoperative serum creatinine was raised and coagulation parameters were normal. Cystoscopy showed a deformed bladder with severe bullous edema of the trigone. Both the ureteric orifices could not be identified on cystoscopy; hence, a decision of antegrade ureteral stenting was taken. Based on the preoperative plain computed tomography (CT) scan determined landmark of the renal pelvis, a Chiba-needle puncture was made 5 cm lateral to the midline at the level of the third lumbar vertebra. Once the right pelvicalyceal system was opacified, mid calyceal puncture was made using an 18G three-part percutaneous access needle (Surgimedik Healthcare India Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai, India). Guidewire could be negotiated into the bladder, and antegrade double-J stent was placed. A similar procedure was performed on the left side. The procedure was uneventful.
Postprocedure, the patient had a progressively increasing abdominal distension, right flank pain, and hypotension. Bedside ultrasonography indicated a large right perirenal hematoma. Contrast-enhanced CT scan confirmed the hematoma [] and demonstrated active contrast leak from the right lumbar artery during the arteriography phase of the CT scan. Renal vessels appeared normal. In view of the dropping blood pressure and hemoglobin levels, a decision of angioembolization was taken.
Transfemoral aortography and renal angiography were performed. Renal vasculature was normal. Selective catheterization of the second right lumbar artery confirmed the extravasation of contrast solution from the middle part of the anterior branch of lumbar artery. The bleeding vessel was embolized using polyvinyl alcohol particles (Boston Scientific Target Therapeutics, California, USA). Posttranscatheter embolization, the pain reduced and blood pressure stabilized.

On physical examination, she was a well-appearing woman of Anglo-European heritage. Neurologic examination was normal. Cardiac examination revealed normal S1 and S2 and no murmur. Pulmonary examination showed clear lungs. Abdomen was benign without guarding and no bruits. No lymphadenopathy was present. She had no joint effusions or signs of arthritis. Lower extremities edema was only 1+ bilaterally.
During her hospital course, her bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide were discontinued and her hypertension was treated with carvedilol and amlodipine. She received intravenous fluids, but serum creatinine did not change. A 24-h urine collection contained a total volume of 1,450 mL, a total urine protein of 8,764 mg per 24 h, and total urine creatinine of 1,145 mg. Urine creatinine concentration was 79 mg/dL, with a serum creatinine of 3.5 mg/dL; thus, measured creatinine clearance was 22 mL/min.
A renal biopsy was performed and revealed a MPGN pattern. Double contours and suspected subendothelial deposits were appreciated on light microscopy. No thrombi, necrosis, or crescents were present. There was mild diffuse mononuclear cell interstitial infiltration and tubulitis noted. The interstitium had mild fibrosis. There was mild intimal thickening of the small arteries. Electron microscopy confirmed electron-dense subendothelial deposits without substructure. Since no glomeruli were present in the specimen submitted for immunofluorescence, a pronase antigen retrieval technique was used on sections prepared from the paraffin block. It revealed granular capillary wall staining with 2–3+ IgG, 2–3+ C1q, and 2–3+ kappa light chain and 1–2+ lambda light chain positivity. There was trace IgM and no IgA staining (Fig. , , ).
The patient was discharged home on carvedilol and lisinopril in lieu of the amlodipine. Before she was able to return to the renal clinic, she was readmitted 1 week after discharge for intractable nausea and vomiting. Admission blood pressure was 206/110. This was attributed to her inability to take her antihypertensive medications. Despite this, her serum creatinine improved to 3.1 mg/dL with BUN 22 mg/dL. Albumin level remained 3.4 g/dL. Urinalysis documented 3+ blood and 4+ protein as on her prior admission with numerous hyaline and granular casts per low power field. A 24-h urine collection contained a total volume of 875 mL and total urine creatinine of 744 mg. The urine creatinine concentration was 85 mg/dL. Total urine protein was 4,148 mg per 24 h. At the time of the 24-h collection, her serum creatinine was 3.7 mg/dL and creatinine clearance was 18 mL/min. Upper endoscopy demonstrated gastritis. Biopsies of the esophagus and duodenum were normal. Helicobacter pylori testing was negative. She was treated with an aggressive regimen of sucralfate, proton pump inhibitor, and H2 blocker.
Upon return to the clinic, 1 month after the biopsy, her blood pressure was reasonably controlled on lisinopril and carvedilol. Bone density was obtained and was normal. 25-hydroxyvitamin D was low at 19 ng/mL and ergocalciferol was started. By this time, a serologic search for an associated systemic disease included negative ANA, anti-double stranded DNA, HIV 1–2, anti-GBM, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ELISA), and rheumatoid factor. The sedimentation rate was elevated at 75 mm/h, and repeat measurement was 111 mm/h. Complement levels were unremarkable with C3 120 mg/dL and C4 slightly high at 41 mg/dL. Serum protein immunoelectrophoresis demonstrated normal IgA, low IgG (287 mg/dL), low IgM (38 mg/dL), and no monoclonal spike. Urine protein immunoelectrophoresis was without monoclonal spike, and the kappa/lambda light chain ratio was 3.28 (normal 2.04–10.37). Hemoglobin A1c level returned at 5.8%. Treatment with antacids, Lisinopril, and carvedilol was continued, and she was instructed to start prednisone 60 mg daily.
Eight weeks after the biopsy, the patient was evaluated at a tertiary care center. She reported taking 3 doses of prednisone but stopped it completely after an episode of visible hematuria. Lisinopril was changed to irbesartan due to persistent dry cough. Laboratory values at this time included a 24-h urine collection with a total volume of 950 mL, total urine creatinine of 950 mg, and urine creatinine concentration of 100 mg/dL. Total urine protein was 2,812 mg per 24 h. A separate random urine sample for protein to creatinine ratio was 1.67 (239/143). Anti-scl-70 was negative. She was counseled to not restart prednisone.
By week 12, her blood pressure was moderately controlled at 150/90. Because of cost, irbesartan was discontinued and losartan 100 mg daily was started. Chlorthalidone 25 mg daily was added for her blood pressure control. Atorvastatin 40 mg once a day was started for hyperlipidemia. She continued on carvedilol and antacids. Examination revealed no edema.
At her tertiary clinic visit 44 weeks after the biopsy, she reported feeling well and examination revealed blood pressure of 106/70 and no edema. Laboratory testing in the clinic included serum creatinine 1.6 mg/dL, BUN 25 mg/dL, serum albumin 4.5 g/dL, and a protein to creatinine ratio of 0.06. Urinalysis registered trace blood and no protein. One week prior to this visit, micro-albumin assay contained 7.4 mg/g (normal <15 mg/g), and the protein to creatinine ratio was 0.06.
Tertiary clinic visit 82 weeks after the biopsy demonstrated well-controlled blood pressure of 117/85. Urinalysis was negative for blood, protein, cells, and casts. Remission was sustained at 92 weeks with stable serum creatinine at 1.2 mg/dL, normal serum albumin, and inactive urinalysis without proteinuria.
Her serial serum creatinine, serum albumin, and urine protein to creatinine ratio values are listed in Table .","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 62-year-old lady was found wandering in the premises of a famous temple town in Kerala. When the local police questioned her, she said that she had left her home a few days ago and would now like to return. She provided them with the telephone number and address of her residence based on which the police were able to reunite her with her family.
On her return, the family discovered that she quickly got back to her old household routine, but was unable to remember people (neighbors, local shopkeeper) and events that had taken place in the preceding weeks. She was also confused about where she had gone and what she had done when she left home, but was able to furnish proof that she had traveled by train to a temple in a neighboring state, where she had spent her childhood. As they could not understand her patches of memory loss, the family brought her for a neurological evaluation.
An interview revealed that she was treated in the outpatient unit of the hospital for a fall six weeks ago. She had fallen from the pillion seat of a scooter and had been brought to the Casualty Section for first aid. There was no loss of consciousness, headache, blurring of vision, or vomiting. She was evaluated as an in-patient for possible post-traumatic sequelae. Medical examination revealed that she was hypertensive, but not on regular treatment. A neurological evaluation at that stage revealed no anomalies in her cognition or behavior. The CT scan and profile on blood investigations were within normal limits.
On this follow up, the Mini Mental State Examination score was 27. With no neurological problems elicited on examination and investigation, a working diagnosis of pseudo-dementia was made and a course of anti-depressants was prescribed.
On follow up, there was improvement in her mood, but the amnesia persisted. She was therefore referred for evaluation, to the clinical psychologist.
In this patient, there were no neurological or behavioral symptoms in the immediate post-traumatic period, except for mild features of a depressive disorder. The question here would be whether absence of “positive findings” could truly rule out organic causes for such impulsivity in behavior. A referral to the mental health practitioner is sometimes a resisted step in the treatment process, especially in a country such as India. It is only when the investigations rule out organicity, that “psychogenicity” of a symptom is considered.
In appearance, she was an obese lady who appeared anxious and tearful. She was initially unwilling to answer questions and repeatedly said that she could not remember what had happened. Speech was slow, but relevant and coherent. Mood was depressed; there was guilt and ideas of hopelessness. There were no hallucinations or delusions. Apart from deficits in semantic memory, there were no anomalies in primary mental functions.
On account of her apparent distress while answering questions, sessions of hypnosis were attempted. However, we encountered resistance and therefore, a supportive client-centered approach was adopted, with which she appeared to be more comfortable.
Formal psychometric assessment was deferred, in favor of serial Mental State Examinations.
Over the next three sessions, she was able to recall incidents of the preceding weeks. The most distressing episode according to her was the argument she had had with her husband. She felt that despite decades of managing the household and coping with several psychosocial stressors, the husband was overly critical of her. She described the intense grief she experienced that had prompted her to walk away from home. She visited several local temples before boarding a train to a famous temple town. After a day's stay there, she traveled by train to a temple in a neighboring state. It was the first time she was traveling alone by train, and she reported that she traveled ticketless on certain parts of the travel. She reported that she did not plan her movements, but seemed to instinctively move from one place to the other. It was only upon her return to her home state, after a few days that her memory “returned” and she went up to a local policeman and asked for help. She reported feeling very guilty over her “flight,” but insisted that there was no deliberate attempt to cause distress to her family. She did not remember people whom she was in contact with, during the travel, but could produce some of the tickets she had used. She had a purse with some money, but had pawned jewellery to purchase clothes and a few other necessities for herself. On her return, she was also very perplexed about the identity of some of the people around her and did not understand why she could not identify them.
There had been no incidents of similar behavior in the past; there were no reports of seizures, somnambulism, or other parasomnias. There were no differences in behavior and cognitive functions following the injury. The family described her as a quiet, responsible individual who had efficiently managed the household. Prior to her flight, she had participated actively in a family function; on her return, despite several cues, she could not recall the event or her family members who had reunited after a long while.
We considered the diagnosis of fugue because of the organized flight from home with significant disruption of her social and occupational routine, as also the absence of pre-morbid neurological or psychiatric problems and the self-remitting course of the altered behavior. The amnesia noted on her return was episodic and circumscribed (restricted to a few select people). The odd points in the case were the age and the absence of severe psychological trauma that could have precipitated the flight.
As we report the case, the client has returned to her pre-morbid level of functioning and comes regularly for follow up. She continues to be on a mild course of anti-depressants and supportive therapy. We plan to monitor her cognitive and psychiatric status over regular follow-up sessions and taper the sessions gradually if she maintains this improvement.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 27-year-old female reported with the chief complaint of a “fractured filling” in her left lower back tooth. History revealed intermittent pain localized to the same tooth during mastication. The tooth was previously restored with a silver amalgam restoration 7 years back. Clinical examination revealed a silver amalgam restoration with secondary caries in the left mandibular first molar (tooth 19) which was tender to percussion. Vitality tests elicited no response. Preoperative radiographs showed widening of periodontal ligament space in relation to the mesial root apex. In addition, radiographic apical contour of the tooth suggested that there might be two distal and two mesial roots (). From the clinical and radiographic findings a diagnosis of pulpal necrosis with symptomatic apical periodontitis was made and endodontic treatment was initiated.
Following endodontic access cavity preparation, two mesial and one buccally placed distal canal orifice was identified. Upon visual inspection of the floor of the pulp chamber using a dental operating microscope, a dark line was observed extending from the distal canal orifice towards the distolingual corner. At this corner, the overlying dentin was removed and a second distal canal orifice was detected. The conventional access was modified to improve access to the additional canals (). Root canal orifices were named as per the nomenclature proposed by Albuquerque et al. []. Working length was confirmed () and the canals were instrumented. Calcium hydroxide was placed as an intracanal medicament with a lentulospiral and the access cavity was sealed with Cavit G. The patient was asymptomatic at the next appointment, a week later, which allowed for root canal obturation and a coronal composite restoration ().","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 68-year-old male presented to the outpatient endoscopy unit for a repeat EUS drainage of a PP.
The patient has a background history of necrotising gallstone pancreatitis that was treated supportively. A subsequent laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. Unfortunately, he developed a PP that required EUS-guided drainage approximately 12 months following his index presentation. A surveillance CT abdomen demonstrated a large recurrence of his PP (approximately 13 cm in largest diameter); thus, a decision for repeat drainage was made. His other comorbidities include chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, hypertension, and a solitary kidney (donor nephrectomy).
A linear echoendoscope was advanced to the second part of the duodenum. External compression of the posterior gastric wall was observed endoscopically. Endosonographically, the PP measured 13 x 10 cm and was punctured using a 19-gauge access needle. Approximately 10 ml of clear fluid was aspirated, and then injected with 20 ml of contrast. A 450-mm Jagwire was passed through the needle into the pseudocyst under fluoroscopy. The access needle was exchanged for a cystotome. A cystpogastrostomy was performed using the cystotome, and a second 450-mm Jagwire was inserted. The cystotome was removed, and two 7 French plastic double pigtail stents were introduced into the PP over the two guidewires under direct fluoroscopy. Both stents appeared to have been positioned satisfactorily, and were draining clear fluid into the stomach (Figure ).
The patient developed severe abdominal pain in the recovery bay. An urgent CT abdomen demonstrated free fluid and gas in the upper abdomen especially anterior to the liver (Figure ). A decision was made to proceed to the operating theatre given concerns for a perforated hollow viscus.
A midline laparotomy was performed. Significant amounts of gastric and pancreatic juices were found throughout the entire peritoneal cavity and evacuated. The gastrocolic ligament was taken down with the harmonic scalpel to allow access to the pancreas. The cystogastrostomy tract and stents were found to have inadvertently entered the peritoneal cavity (Figure ), and thus were removed.
A decision was made to surgically decompress the PP given the high likelihood of recurrence. An anterior longitudinal gastrotomy was performed. There was difficulty locating the PP through the posterior stomach wall as it had collapsed, having spilled its contents into abdominal cavity. The PP cavity was not identifiable despite using an intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS). An 8-French infant feeding tube was inserted through the peritoneal defect caused by the transgastric stent, and placed into the PP cavity. The feeding tube was subsequently injected with saline (Figure ).
A subsequent attempt at transgastric localisation of the PP was successful using IOUS given the re-expansion of the PP. A seeking needle was then used to confirm the location of the PP. A 45-mm Endo-GIA (Medtronic plc, Minneapolis, MN) stapler was used to complete the cystogastrostomy, and the edges oversewn with 3-0 prolene (Figure ). The anterior gastrotomy wound was closed with 3-0 PDS. The PP defect and corresponding gastrotomy defect were closed with 3-0 PDS. A feeding jejunostomy was fashioned. The abdomen was washed with saline and two drains placed: one on the anterior stomach and one on the closed pseudocyst defect.
The patient recovered well postoperatively. A CT contrast swallow was organised on day 10 after the operation, which demonstrated no evidence of any leak. The abdominal drains were removed after drain amylase levels were found to be normal. The patient was initially supported with postpyloric feeds through his feeding jejunostomy, and then slowly transitioned back into a regular diet. He was discharged from hospital two weeks after his operation. He remains free from any recurrence 13 months after his surgery.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"The patient was a 41-year-old man (height 174.2 cm, body weight 60 kg) with dextro-TGA who underwent balloon atrioseptostomy treatment at birth because of desaturation. He also had a Mustard procedure (interatrial baffle) at 10 months of age and required surgical repair for pulmonary vein stenosis at 2 years of age. At 41 years of age, he developed severe systemic RV failure and pulmonary edema (Fig. ). He was treated with inotropic agents, mechanical ventilation, intra-aortic balloon pumping, and continuous hemodiafiltration. His hemodynamic status was stabilized with these treatments, but he remained inotrope-dependent, and his condition gradually worsened despite optimal medical therapy. After a medical team preoperative meeting, he was scheduled for a VAD implantation of the RV as a bridge to orthotropic cardiac transplantation.
Preoperative cardiac catheterization indicated elevated pulmonary arterial wedge pressure and severely impaired systemic RV function with infusion of dobutamine (3 μg/kg/min) and carperitide (24 ng/kg/min), a recombinant atrial natriuretic peptide with vasodilating and diuretic activity (Table ). Echocardiography identified the dilated RV, preserved pulmonary ventricle (morphological left ventricle), and increased baffle flow velocity (Table ). Chest radiography and computed tomography scan showed a severely dilated RV (Figs. and ).
In the operating room, a continuous monitoring of electrocardiography, SpO2, systemic arterial pressure via a right radial artery catheter, bispectral index (BIS; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN), and regional cerebral oxygen saturation at the right and left forehead (INVOS™ 5100C, Somanetics, USA) was initiated before anesthesia induction. After administration of 100% oxygen, general anesthesia was induced slowly by intravenous administration of 3 mg of midazolam, 0.5 mg of fentanyl, and 50 mg of rocuronium. Additionally, dobutamine (3.3 μg/kg/min), nicorandil (1.1 μg/kg/min), which has the dual properties of a nitrate and a potassium channel opener, and carperitide (33 ng/kg/min) were continuously administered to minimize anesthetic-induced cardiac depression. During anesthesia induction and tracheal intubation, his circulatory and respiratory status remained stable. After tracheal intubation, a transesophageal echocardiography probe was inserted. Then, a central venous catheter and right heart catheter were inserted via the right internal jugular vein. The latter catheter (Swan Ganz catheter) was guided to the right pulmonary artery under fluoroscopic control because of his unique anatomy with interatrial baffle.
His anesthesia depth was controlled at a BIS of 40–60 by a continuous infusion of propofol (3–5 mg/kg/h), remifentanil (0.2–0.3 μg/kg/min), and rocuronium (7 μg/kg/min).
A standard median sternotomy was performed. Because his heart was heavily adherent, the cardiac surgeons had difficulty in adhesiolysis. The systemic aorta and systemic atrium were cannulated, and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was instituted. At first, the patient’s aortic valve was replaced with a bioprosthetic valve for moderate aortic valve regurgitation. Subsequently, the trabeculae carneae of the RV, which could disturb the flow to the inflow cannula, were resected via the RV apex; the inflow cannula was positioned at the apex of the RV. The outflow cannula graft was anastomosed to the ascending aorta, and then a Jarvik 2000 VAD (Jarvik Heart, Inc., New York, NY, US) was implanted.
At the weaning of the CPB, infusion of dobutamine (3.3 μg/kg/min) and inhalation of nitric oxide (20 ppm), to decrease afterload of the pulmonary LV, was started. The CPB weaning was not difficult, and the VAD was successfully commenced at a pump speed of 10,000 rpm (3–5 L/min). The aortic cross-clamping, CPB, surgery, and anesthesia lasted 200, 296, 628, and 807 min, respectively. Estimated blood loss and urine output were 2051 and 2390 mL, respectively. Overall, 900 mL of crystalloid, 900 mL of colloid, 960 mL of packed red blood cells, 560 mL of fresh frozen plasma, and 200 mL of platelet concentrate were administered. After completion of operation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit with ventilator support under propofol sedation.
On postoperative day (POD) 2, the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation. On POD 5, after our surgeons decreased the VAD dial from 3 to 2, the patient developed pulmonary congestion with respiratory distress, decreased arterial oxygen saturation, and elevated pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) (Table ). Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) was adopted, and intensified diuretic therapy was started. Additionally, the intensivists returned the VAD dial from 2 to 3. A few days later, he recovered from congestive heart failure, and then, NPPV was stopped. Following this, the patient did well hemodynamically and had good VAD performance. Another important point for postoperative management of VAD implantation is to prevent thrombosis. In this case, continuous infusion of heparin was administered for anticoagulation. The heparin infusion adjusted to an activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) ration of 1.5–2.0 (or 40–50 s). Actually, the infusion rate or heparin was 15,000–20,000 units per day.
The patient was discharged from the hospital on POD 60. He is now eagerly awaiting heart transplantation. Table shows his hemodynamic data, and Fig. shows his chest radiography on POD 90.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 69-year-old male patient presented with stuporous mentality after fall from 2-meter height. On admission, the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 7/15. Neurological exam revealed no further abnormalities. Brain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an ICH in the left temporal lobe with diffuse SAH and subdural hemorrhage (). A brain CT angiography revealed a pseudoaneurysm of MMA (). Sequentially, the patient was submitted to cerebral angiography and the left external carotid angiogram revealed a pseudoaneurysm arisen from the anterior branch of the MMA accompanied by dAVF at the middle segment of sphenoid ridge (). Through the right common femoral artery, a guiding catheter (Envoy 6 Fr; Cordis/Johnson & Johnson, Miami, FL, USA) was positioned in the left external carotid artery. We carefully naviated a microcatheter pre-shaped 45 degrees (Excelsior SL-10; Stryker Neurovascular, Fremont, CA, USA) under the guidance of a 0.014-inch microguidewire (Synchro 14; Stryker Neurovascular) to reach the juxtaproximal to the pseudoaneurysm via MMA. After the confirmation of the appropriate position of the microcatheter via repetitive superselective angiography (), embolization of a pseudoaneurysm and MMA was performed using 25% n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) (Hystoacryl; B. Braun, Melsnagen, Germany) mixed with iodized oil (Lipiodol; Guerbet, Aulnay-sous-Boid, France). We achieved angiographically complete occlusion of a pseudoaneurysm and dural AVF (). Follow-up brain CT scan showed no significant hematoma enlargement and well penetrated glue cast at the all the vascular lesions ().
The patient presented an improvement in consciousness for GCS score 15 after 12 days. However, at the 18-day after the procedure, the right side weakness and dysarthria were developed. Brain CT angiography and subsequent left internal carotid angiography revealed cerebral vasospasm at the distal segment of MCA with multiple low densitied at the left MCA territories (). Cerebral vasospasm was treated using intra-arterial (IA) nimodipin infusion, and it was improved. At discharge, dysarthria was improved, but right side weakness was remained (Grade 3).","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"Case 1 is a 32-year-old woman originating from Yunfu City in Guangdong Province, China. She was referred to our hospital for a routine prenatal examination at the 18th week of gestation and then underwent thalassemia screening. Case 2 is a 51-year-old man from Guangzhou City in Guangdong Province. He attended our hospital for routine partner testing for thalassemia. These two cases were from unrelated families. Both agreed to participate in our study and signed informed consent forms. All studies were approved by the Ethics Committee of Guangdong Women and Children Hospital.
Blood samples were collected and hematological parameters were determined using a Sysmex XN5000 automated hematology analyzer (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan). Hb analysis was conducted with an automated capillary 2 electrophoresis system (Sebia, Lisses, France). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using the Lab-Aid 820 automation system (Zee San Biotech Company, Fujian, China). Twenty-three mutations common in individuals from southern China were routinely measured in our laboratory by a suspension array system, as previously described. α1-, α2-, and β-globin genes were independently amplified by PCR using previously described primer pairs, then PCR products were purified and sequenced by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The sequences were compared with National Centre for Biotechnology Information reference sequences (HBA1: NC_000016.10: 176680-177522; HBA2: NC_000016.10: 172876-173710; HBB: NC_000011.10: 5225464-5227071) using Sequence Scanner software (Applied Biosystems).
Hematological indices and genotypes are summarized in . Both samples showed characteristics of microcytic and hypochromic erythrocytes. Iron deficiency was excluded (data not shown). In both cases, capillary electrophoresis (CE) revealed an abnormal Hb X fraction which was close to the Hb A peak and easily identified, even if partial overlap persisted (). The suspension array system determined that both cases carried heterozygous (- - SEA/) deletions for α-thalassemia and were negative for β-thalassemia (data not shown). DNA sequencing detected a substitution (HBA1: c.343C>G) at codon 114 of HBA1 that was previously reported as Hb Broomhill (), which was consistent with CE results. No other mutation with clinical significance was observed in either of the cases. Eventually, the two patients were diagnosed with compound heterozygosity for Hb Broomhill and the (- - SEA/) α-thalassemia deletion.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 69-year-old man visited our hospital for palpitation and dyspnea on exertion. The symptoms began four months prior to his visit to the hospital. On physical examination, a rapid heartbeat and friction rub were audible, and a 6-cm linear scar was observed on the right upper chest. Edema of both lower extremities was observed. At the age of 6 in 1950, he was wounded in the chest during a shooting spree by North Korean soldiers during the Korean War. However, at that time he could not visit a hospital and was treated with folk remedies. On the chest X-ray, a bullet adjacent to the right cardiac border and bilateral pleural effusion was noted (). On electrocardiography, he had typical atrial flutter with 2-to-1 atrioventricular conduction, and his heart rate was 150 bpm (). An axial computed tomographic image () showed that the bullet was likely located in the right atrium. Thickening of the pericardium was also observed. A long axis reformatted image () and a three-dimensional volume-rendered image () confirmed that the bullet was located in the epicardial fat and abutted the right atrium at an acute angle. Transthoracic echocardiography during the atrial flutter and sinus rhythm revealed bi-atrial enlargement, thickened pericardium, septal bouncing motion, and significant respiratory variations of the mitral inflow velocity, which were compatible with constrictive pericarditis (). The E/A and E/e' ratios were 4.4 and 8, respectively. The septal e' was higher than the lateral e' (12 cm/sec and 10 cm/sec, respectively). To rule out lead poisoning from the bullet, the patient's blood lead level was checked and lead was undetectable. Atrial flutter and constrictive pericarditis were the suspected causes of the palpitation and dyspnea on exertion. An electrophysiological study confirmed that the atrial flutter was cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent: during the electrophysiological study, fluoroscopy showed that the bullet moved primarily with respiratory movements and partially with heart-beating movements. Moreover, pericardial calcification was also observed adjacent to the coronary sinus. Radiofrequency catheter ablation for ty-pical atrial flutters was performed by a bidirectional conduction block of the cavotricuspid isthmus. One week after radiofrequency catheter ablation, surgical extraction of the bullet and pericardiectomy were performed. In the surgical field, the pericardium was th-ickened and the bullet was severely adhered to the adjacent epicardial tissue (). There were scattered substances around the bullet, which were presumed to be gunpowder. Due to the gunpowder, the pericardium was thickened and stiffened. The rusted bullet was extracted 63 years after the initial gunshot wound. The pathology of the adjacent epicardial tissue showed dystrophic calcification (). After surgery, the patient recovered without complications and there was no echocardiographic evidence of constrictive physiology.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 57-year-old male patient presented to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, of a dental institution with a swelling in the left lower lip region for about 6 months. Swelling was uniform in consistency and painless with no other signs of inflammation. Clinical examination revealed an exophytic, nodular, reddish-purple, well-outlined lesion measuring about 1 cm × 1 cm in diameter, located on the left lower lip []. The patient had no other dentoalveolar symptoms and no sign of local infection.
Surgical excision under local anesthesia with diode laser (980 nm) was done. An elliptic incision was made to fully enucleate the lesion along with the overlying mucosa [Figure and ]. Antibiotic and analgesic therapy was given to the patient for 5 days. Antibacterial chlorhexidine gluconate rinse (0.12%) was prescribed for one week.
The specimen was fixed in 10% formalin solution. The histological examination made with hematoxylin and eosin [] and smooth muscle actin staining [] revealed the diagnosis of angioleiomyoma. The lesion was composed of large vascular channels of varying caliber, surrounded by thick walls of irregularly arranged, spindle-shaped cells []. The spindle-shaped cells showed elongated blunt-ended nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm-forming smooth muscle bundles showing interlacing patterns with collagen fibers between dilated and slit-like vascular spaces []. Whorled bundles of muscle fibers were seen fused with the vessel walls. Necrosis, atypical mitosis, and pleomorphism were not observed in the histological examination. The postoperative course of the patient was uneventful with 7 days of follow-up []. The tissue was completely healed and there was no sign of scar. There was no recurrence at 3 months of follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year. Exclusion Criteria: Younger than 65 years old, having decompensated liver disease, psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance, having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy.",0.5
"A16-year-old male patient was presented with headache and vomiting for 2 months. He developed left upper and lower limb weakness for 15 days. There was no history of immune suppression, family history of melanoma, or nevus or sunburns. His general examination did not reveal any nevus. Neurological examination revealed bilateral papilledema and Grade 4 power in the left upper and lower limb.
Computed tomography (CT) plain imaging showed cortical based hyperdense lesion measuring 26 mm × 26 mm in the right parietal region. It was associated with bleed measuring 48 mm × 38 mm. [] Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed well-circumscribed, lobulated, cortical-based lesion with bleed in the right parietal region. It measured 26 mm × 26 mm × 18 mm in size. It was isointense to gray matter on both T1, T2W images and mildly hyperintense on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. Diffusion-weighted images (DWI) showed irregular peripheral restriction of the lesion and susceptibility on susceptibility-weighted images. Heterogeneous enhancement on contrast images was noted. The lesion was associated with varying ages of bleed measured 48 mm × 42 mm × 34 mm. The bleed showed intense hyperintensity on T1W images and iso- to hyper-intense on T2W images. There was perilesional edema with midline shift of 5 mm. Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography showed normal flow signals within the intracranial arteries. No other abnormality was seen [Figure –]. Based on imaging findings, we considered hemorrhagic mass lesions such as high-grade glioma or metastatic lesions as possibilities. He underwent a right parietal craniotomy and total excision of the lesion and evacuation of hematoma. Intraoperatively, hematoma was seen on the pia. The lesion was soft to firm, fleshy reddish dark brown, and vascular. Apart from the blood, there was no pigmentation of the meninges. There were no areas of pigmentation in the inner surface of the dura mater [Figure and ] Postoperative period was uneventful. Postoperative CT and MRI showed total excision of lesion with bleed [Figure –].
Histopathology from paraffin blocks showed interesting features. Sections examined from the tumor showed cellular neoplasm composed of large cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, arranged in perivascular papillary pattern and in sheets. Tumor cells had coarse chromatin with brisk mitotic activity (8–10/10 hpf). At places, the tumor cells exhibited nuclear atypia. Focally, the tumor cells had intracytoplasmic brownish pigment along with hemosiderin-laden macrophages. Necrosis and thrombosed vessels were noted. The differential diagnoses considered based on these histological features were a high-grade glioma and a papillary meningioma.
Immunohistochemistry for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), IDH-1 (R132H), cytokeratin, CD34, chromogranin, and synaptophysin was negative and strongly positive for S-100 protein. INI-1 showed retained expression. MIB-1 labeling index was15%–20%. In view of diffuse and strong S-100 immunohistochemistry (IHC), further IHC with human melanin black-45 (HMB-45) antibody was performed. The tumor showed strong HMB-45 immunopositivity and the final diagnosis of MM was offered [Figure –]. BRAF mutations analysis could not be done in this patient as our laboratory was not equipped with the facilities for doing it.
The patient underwent screening to look for the primary site for melanoma. A thorough search was made for a primary lesion in the other probable sites such as skin, mucus membrane, eyes, and lower gastrointestinal tract, which yielded negative results. CT scans of the thorax and abdomen yielded normal findings with no evidence of primary lesion. We confirmed that the intracranial lesion was a PMM. He was referred to oncologist for further treatment. Four months following surgery, he completed intensity-modulated radiotherapy 60 Gy in 30 fractions. He did not receive any chemotherapy. He again developed headache and vomiting immediately after completion of the radiation therapy. CT brain showed right parietooccipital bleed [Figure and ]. MRI done showed a tentorial-based recurrent tumor in the right parietooccipital region. It was measuring 1.5 cm × 1.3 cm size. It was heterogenous intense in both T1 and T2W sequences with contrast enhancement. Gliotic area was seen in the previously operated cavity. Imaging confirmed a recurrent tumor remote from the previously operated site and away from the leptomeninges [Figure –]. He underwent a right parietooccipital craniotomy and total excision of the tumor. Tumor was soft and suckable mixed with blood clots [Figure and ]. Falx and tentorium were seen and brain was lax at the end. The patient had a normal postoperative course without any complications. Postoperative CT confirmed total excision [Figure and ] and histopathology confirmed HMB-45 strongly positive recurrent melanoma. Five months following second surgery, the patient eventually succumbed to recurrence and expired.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 55-year-old male with a past medical history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastritis, presented to our emergency department via ambulance with a chief complaint of lightheadedness, associated with nausea and vomiting. The patient reported feeling lightheaded two hours prior to arrival, along with nausea and three episodes of non-bloody emesis. The patient underwent cardiac ablation one month prior for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He denied chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, syncope, weakness, numbness, or tingling. He received 324 mg of aspirin en route. On physical exam, his heart rate was significantly elevated at 191 beats per minute, and he was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 61/57 mmHg. His pulse oximetry was 98% on room air, and he was afebrile.
The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) showed wide complex tachycardia (WCT) (Figure ). Since the patient was hypotensive, and therefore hemodynamically unstable, the decision was made to cardiovert the patient with informed consent. The patient was successfully cardioverted with 100 joules (J) of electricity on a biphasic device.
The patient’s heart rate improved to 89 beats per minute following the cardioversion, and his blood pressure normalized (Figure ). The patient was no longer lightheaded and nauseated. The patient’s troponin came back at 0.01 ng/mL (normal), he did not have any electrolyte abnormalities or anemia. His thyroid-stimulating hormone level was also normal.
The patient was admitted for cardiac workup, and started on flecainide and nebivolol (a beta1 selective blocker) by the cardiologist then discharged home. The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout his hospital stay.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 24-year-old unmarried female patient presented to us with a persistent fistula in the right iliac fossa following an appendicectomy done in another hospital 6 weeks previously. On further questioning, she informed us that she had presented to this hospital with a 2-week history of abdominal pain, confined to the right lower abdomen. She complained of general ill health and occasional altered bowel habits for 6 months prior to this acute episode.
An enquiry with the doctors who had initially seen her revealed that at the time of presentation for acute appendicitis she was quite unwell with fever, tachycardia, and dehydration. Her abdomen was tender all over with guarding, more pronounced over the right lower half. Her white cell count was 24 × 109/L. An X-ray of her abdomen showed a few fluid levels and an ultrasound scan revealed free fluid in the abdomen with an associated right iliac fossa mass.
A diagnosis of pelvic peritonitis secondary to acute appendicitis was made by the physicians, and she was taken up for surgery after adequate resuscitation. The abdomen was approached through a right McBurney's incision. There was pus in the abdomen with an appendicular mass, and the appendix appeared oedematous, thickened, and congested. An appendicectomy was carried out followed by a thorough irrigation of the abdominal cavity. The abdomen was closed after placing a drain, which was removed on the 3rd post-operative day. In spite of antibiotic administration, she developed a wound infection and persistent pyrexia. She was managed conservatively with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medication and eventually improved, except for a persistent purulent discharge from the wound. She then decided to seek our opinion and was admitted under our care for further investigation and management.
The appendicular histopathology was retrieved from the previous hospital and revealed transmural inflammation with granulomas suggestive of Crohn's disease. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen carried out in our hospital showed pericaecal collection with an inflammatory mass in front of the caecum ().
The abdomen was surgically explored through the previous incision after excising the fistula leading into the caecum. An inflammatory mass associated with the caecum was noted. The appendicular stump had not healed, and was draining into a cavity which was communicating with the wound, indicating a complex enterocutaneous fistula. A limited right hemicolectomy was carried out and continuity established with a primary anastomosis of macroscopically-appearing healthy bowel of the ascending colon and terminal ileum. A specimen of the resected caecum revealed the cobblestone appearance of the mucosa, strongly suggesting the possibility of underlying caecal Crohn's disease (). The histology was reported as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consistent with Crohn's disease (). The patient's post-operative recovery was uneventful. She was referred to a gastroenterologist and was being treated with mesasalazine and a regular annual colonoscopy. When last seen at two years post-surgery she continued to remain in good health.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 62-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of mental abnormality and hypomnesia for 3 months. The main mental symptoms were gibberish, irrational talk, impaired mental attention, without apparent hallucinations and delusions. The patient did not present with fluctuating consciousness, lack of consciousness, or loss of consciousness. The family of the patient reported that she had a history of fever before she experienced the mental symptoms. Her highest body temperature was 38.6 °C. Her axillary temperature became normal after she received antibiotic therapy for 4 days. However, she gradually developed symptoms of mental abnormality. She also intermittently complained of abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, and urinary incontinence for 1 month. She did not experience other discomforts, such as headaches, dizziness, and convulsion. She visited a local hospital in October 2018, and the routine blood test showed that the white blood cell counts were normal, and the percentage of lymphocytes was high. The blood potassium was 1.91 mmol/l (normal 3.5-5.3 mmol/l), and the prolactin level was 90.55 μg/l (normal 2.74–26.72 μg/l). The free thyroxine was slightly high, the thyroglobulin antibody was 12.32 IU/ml (normal 0–115 IU/ml), and the thyroid peroxidase antibody was 10.42 IU/ml (normal 0–34 IU/ml). The testing results of antinuclear antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anti-Jo-1 antibody, anti-dsDNA antibody, anti-Scl-70 antibody, anti-SSA antibody, and anti-SSB antibody were yielded negative, and the tests for hepatitis, HIV, and syphilis virus were also negative. The local hospital suspected intracranial infection, endocrine disease, and electrolyte disorders and gave her symptomatic treatment. Nevertheless, her symptoms showed no noticeable improvement. It was difficult to diagnose the disease, so the patient was admitted to our hospital. The patient had a history of diabetes, hypertension, erosive gastritis, and cataract surgery, but she had no family history of neurological diseases.
The physical examination revealed that her body temperature was 36.8 °C, and there was tenderness below the xiphoid. The neurological examination showed impaired mental attention and reaction capacity, slow speech, normal manifestations of the brain nerve, normal muscle strength, and muscle tone, negative meningeal irritation sign and pathological reflex, normal tendon reflex. The patient could not cooperate with the sensory system examination. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score was only 6/30.
Encephalitis was initially suspected, and lumbar puncture was performed. The CSF examination showed that the CSF pressure was 110 mmH2O, and the white blood cell count was normal, but she had an increased total protein level of 0.57 g/l (normal 0.15–0.45 g/l) and a glucose level of 5.10 mmol/l (normal 2.2–3.9 mmol/l). The coxsackie B virus, enterovirus, and cytomegalovirus test levels were normal. Bacterial culture and Cryptococcus neoformans tests were negative. A contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain was normal. The diagnosis of encephalitis was excluded in general. However, leukoencephalopathy was evident on the T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. A high-signal intensity in the white matter of the cerebral hemisphere, especially at the subcortex of the frontotemporal and corona radiata, was found on the T2 FLAIR images (Fig. a-c). The MRI imaging of the left basal ganglia and bilateral corona radiata showed lacunar infarction. Magnetic resonance angiography indicated that the blood vessels were normal. The DWI results revealed a symmetrically distributed strip-shaped high-intensity signal of the corticomedullary junction in the bilateral frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes (Fig. d-f).
Skin biopsy samples were obtained at 10 cm above the patient’s ankle. A light microscope was used to examine the samples, which showed hyperkeratosis of the epidermis. A few lymphocytes and tissue cells infiltrated through the superficial vessels of the dermis (Fig. a). Electron microscopy showed round-shaped intranuclear inclusions in the nucleus of the fibrocytes. The intranuclear inclusions had clear borders and were composed of fibrous substances without a membrane structure (Fig. b and c).
The fasting blood glucose was 9.48 mmol/l, and glycosylated hemoglobin was 6.6%. The routine urine test showed normal results. The patient presented with mental abnormality for 3 months. We did not consider the diagnoses of hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome. Furthermore, the patient did not present with depression, anxiety, consciousness disorders, hallucinations, and neurasthenia, which were common mental symptoms in patients with diabetes. The results of the electrolyte showed hypokalemia (2.6 mmol/L), hyponatremia (127.3 mmol/L), and hypochloremia (86.5 mmol/L). The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and cortisol hormone tests showed normal results. The MRI of the hypophysis showed no abnormal areas. The electroencephalography showed low-and moderate-amplitude desynchronized-mixed waves when she fell asleep.
Brain protection and symptomatic therapy were given when the patient was hospitalized, and the symptoms were relieved. However, she still complained of recurrent vomiting and urinary incontinence. The patient was alive, and the condition of the patient did not worsen or improve for 6 months after she was discharged.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"On 21 May 2009, a 42-yr-old male patient visited our hospital because of malaise and jaundice. He had been working as an office manager of a trading company in China for two years. Two mild fever, and one month before examination, he felt unusual fatigue and jaundice. Twenty days before examination, he had been informed that his acute hepatitis was unusual because he had no hepatitis A, B, or C viral markers. He took herbal medication and received acupuncture in China under the diagnosis of acute hepatitis of unknown origin. His symptoms improved under herbal medication, but remained. He returned to Korea for treatment of the acute hepatitis. He had no other symptoms except for scanty whitish phlegm. He had been healthy until the recent illness. He was not currently on medication, was not an injecting drug abuser. He did not smoke nor drink alcohol. He had received no blood transfusion. He had been married for seven years, but had lived alone in China for two years. He was well oriented and his vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed icteric sclera and tender hepatomegaly. No mucous membrane lesions nor lymphadenopathy were present and he was afebrile. Cutaneous manifestations consisted of macular and papular lesions, about 0.5 cm in diameter, localized on the trunk, palms, and soles (). Genital examination revealed no lesions nor ulcers. Lymph nodes were not palpable in the neck, axillary, or inguinal areas. Laboratory tests showed the following: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 2,974 IU/L, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) 1,755 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 89 IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 119 IU/L, total bilirubin 8.3 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 6.9 mg/dL, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, albumin 2.4 g/dL, total protein 9.2 g/dL, white blood cell (WBC) 13,600/µL, hemoglobin 9.7 g/dL, platelets 752,000/µL, international normalized ratio (INR) 1.06, venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) was positive with a titer >1:1,024, and his fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) was reactive. A hepatitis panel including IgM anti-HAV, HBsAg, and anti-HCV, antinuclear antibody, ceruloplasmin, copper, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were all nonreactive. Computerized tomography didn't show any evidence of bile duct obstruction. It showed also mildly enlarged liver, nonspecifically enlarged lymph nodes at the porta hepatis area, and thickened gall bladder wall (). Chest radiography was normal.
Liver biopsy revealed portal-to-portal or portal to central zone bridge necrosis, and widening by lymphocyte infiltration, accompanied by intracanalicular and intracellular cholestasis. These findings were compatible with acute hepatitis (). A modified Warthin-Starry stain was negative for spirochetes. Skin biopsy revealed a perivascular mixed-cell infiltrate of prominent plasma cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes around a blood vessel that contained swollen endothelial cells ().
The patient was treated with weekly intramuscular benzathine penicillin, 2,400,000 U, for a total of three doses. One week after treatment, his fatigue and rash were markedly improved. Three weeks after treatment, ALP was 288 IU/L, total bilirubin was 0.3 mg/dL () and four weeks after treatment, the VDRL titer was down to 1:64. He did not develop a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. Positive serologic tests and a prompt response to penicillin treatment confirmed the diagnosis of syphilitic cholestatic hepatitis.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 33-year-old Turkish woman patient was admitted with complaints of waist pain that extended down her left leg. She was diagnosed with left L5-S1 paramedian disc herniation and admitted for operation (). In her preoperative neurological examination, she showed a left laseque of 45 degree +, hypoesthesia in left L5, S1 dermatomes and left foot dorsiflexion (DF) strength of 4/5. Left L5 hemipartial laminectomy, L5-S1 discectomy, and foraminotomy were performed. No complication occurred during the operation. Postoperative early neurological examination did not determine any new neurologic deficit. At the postoperative 12th hour, neurological deficiency was observed. Upon neurological evaluation, left foot DF strength was 0/5, plantar flexion (PF) strength was 2/5, and urine incontinence and hypoesthesia in left L4, L5, S1 dermatomes were determined. Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed acute SEH at the surgical site (), and the patient underwent reoperation. Blood clots were evacuated and decompression was performed. There was no active bleeding at the site (). Early clinical recovery was observed after reoperation, On postoperative 5th day neurological examination showed left foot DF strength 2/5, PF strength 5/5 and there was no urine incontinence. The patient was admitted to physical therapy and a rehabilitation program on the 7th day postoperation. 4 months postoperation, complete recovery was observed in the patient’s motor deficits.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 71-year-old non-smoker woman presented at our ambulatory with persistent dyspnea despite many months therapy with systemic steroids and inhaled bronchodilator plus steroids for a previous history of bronchial asthma. Lung function tests showed a plateau in the middle of the expiratory part of the flow-volume curve without significant improvement after short-acting beta2 agonist inhalation, suggesting the presence of intra-thoracic irreversible obstruction []. At the chest X-ray, a relevant latero-lateral stenosis of the distal trachea was evident. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan was then performed showing a diffuse thickening of lateral right tracheal wall until the carina with involvement of right upper lobe bronchus and apical segmental bronchus. Fibrobronchoscopy confirmed the presence of tracheal right deviation with a stenosis of about the 25% of the distal tracheal lumen extended to the right upper lobe bronchus caused by marked mucosal hypertrophy []. Bronchial biopsy was positive to the Congo red stain so the diagnosis of primary tracheo-bronchial amyloidosis (isolated AL) was performed. The presence of extra-pulmonary lesions was then excluded through radiological examination (total-body CT scan) and immunological and serological chemistry tests (immunoglobulins and pro-B-type natriuretic peptid -pro-BNP- measurement, Bence Jones protein lab test, routine blood tests). The patient was successfully treated with the placement of a metallic tracheal stent following a Nd-Yag laser-assisted disobstruction of central airways.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"The patient is a 44-year-old female, with a medical history of migraines, mild arterial hypertension, and a left vertebral artery dissection in 2014, without brain infarction (Figures and ). She was using losartan and aspirin daily. The patient suffers from recurrent headaches related to the first 3 days of her menstruation cycle. Her 75-year-old mother was diagnosed with a thoracic aortic aneurysm 10 years previously.
In September 2016, she presented with oppressive headache with left predominance, photophobia and nausea, lasting for 6 days. The intensity of the pain was 8 out of 10 on a visual analog scale (VAS). She also complained of cervical discomfort. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed left internal carotid artery dissection extended between the upper cervical and supraclinoid segments (Figures and ). No ischemic brain damage was observed. Therefore, she was admitted to the emergency department, and aspirin orally was administered in doses of 250 mg at bed time. There were no focal neurological signs on physical examination. The patient had good spatial–temporal orientation and was afebrile.
We attributed the headache to both the left internal carotid artery dissection and the migraine. There was an insufficient response to a combination of ketoprofen and metamizole i.v. Thus, intravenous betamethasone was added to the treatment regimen to provide a rescue medication for the refractory pain. However, the patient showed only a partial response after a 3-day course. She was then prescribed oral topiramate 50 mg two times a day as preventive therapy and naproxen sodium 550 mg as acute treatment option.
One week later, a new CTA was performed and showed no changes compared to the previous imaging.
Apart from hypertension and migraine, we did not identify other putative risk factors for dissections of extracranial arteries such as recent respiratory tract infection and hyperhomocysteinemia. There was no history of major or minor cervical trauma, chiropractic maneuver, or hyperextension injury. Infectious-inflammatory pathology of the paranasal sinuses was excluded with a computed tomography. The patient did not have signs of either hypermobility or dermic lesions. A dermatologist ruled out connective tissue disorders. Renal fibromuscular dysplasia was ruled out using non-invasive imaging duplex ultrasound. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed no abnormalities such as congenital heart defects and left ventricular outflow tract malformations. A computed tomographic scanning and aortography ruled out aortic aneurysm.
To determine the possible nature of this recurrent dissection, an aortopathy comprehensive panel was ordered with sequence analysis and exonic deletion/duplication testing of 25 genes (ACTA2, CBS, COL3A1, COL5A1, COL5A2, EFEMP2, FBN1, FBN2, FLNA; MAT2A, MED12, MYH12, MYH11, MYLK, NOTCH1, PLOD1, PRKG1, SKI, SLCA10, SMAD3, SMAD4, SMAD6, TGFB2, TGFB3, TGBR1, TGFBR2). This test is a comprehensive analysis of genes associated with inherited aortopathy and connective tissue disorders. We ordered it because of the antecedent of maternal thoracic aortic aneurysm (INVITAE, San Francisco, CA, USA; ).
A heterozygous variant was identified in the NOTCH 1 gene (exon 34, c.6365C>T). This sequence replaces proline with leucine at codon 2122 of the NOTCH 1 protein (p.Pro2122Leu). Her mother was also tested, and she was positive for this variant in heterozygous state.
The patient was discharged without focal neurologic deficit with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 0 (0–42). After 6 months, she was on aspirin 100 mg and topiramate 100 mg per day, remained with NIHSS 0 and was able to return to normal activities. There was a reduction in the headache days to about 1 day/month and in the headache severity (VAS = 2).","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 69-year-old man was referred to our clinic in August, 2006 presenting with decreased visual acuity in his right eye. He had been diagnosed with CIMF in July, 2000 and continued to have supportive care for CIMF throughout his follow-up. He had no specific ocular history and no history of irradiation. Visual acuities were 20/25 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left. Slit lamp examination showed no abnormalities on the conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber and iris. Fundus examination disclosed a mild vitreous hemorrhage in the right eye (). The peripheral fundi of both eyes showed marked vessel occlusion and microaneurysms in the temporal area. Fluorescein angiography in both eyes showed arteriovenous anastomosis with a marked area of nonperfusion and multiple sea-fan neovascularization on both eyes (). On laboratory examination, hemoglobin was 4.9 g/dL, platelet count was 63,000/mm3, and white blood cell count was 2,500/mm3 (with no blast cells). A peripheral blood smear test showed teardrop-shaped red cells. His fasting blood sugar value was normal, and the hemoglobin electrophoresis study was negative. Bone marrow examination showed hypocellular marrow with severe fibrosis and osteosclerosis (cellularity 11-20%), and no Philadelphia chromosome or BCR/ABL gene rearrangement was found.
In view of these findings, photocoagulation of the peripheral avascular retina of the left eye and laser photocoagulation with pars plana vitrectomy of the right eye were performed. Intraoperative findings were mild vitreous hemorrhage with a diffuse traction membrane around the temporal avascular retina. The vitreous hemorrhage and traction membrane were removed and laser photocoagulation was performed. Four weeks after surgery, his visual acuities were 20/25 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left, fundus examination of the right eye revealed no vitreous hemorrhage, and the retinal neovascularization had regressed in both eyes with good laser scars ().","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 32 year-old woman from a rural area, presented to the general surgery clinic with mild and continuous pain in the lateral aspect of her left thigh. Concomitantly, she was complaining of gradually increasing swelling in the lateral aspect of her left thigh for about 1 year duration. Family history and drug history was unremarkable. On examination, there was a round, non-tender, non-mobile mass in the lateral aspect of her left thigh. There was no overlying skin changes, ultrasound (US) showed 15cm × 5cm solid-cystic lesion in the lateral aspect of the left thigh with multiple well-defined cystic lesions. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed a relative large multisystem lesion in the lateral aspect of the thigh with connection to the femoral bone, in favor of hydatid cyst (1 and 2). Chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound excluded lung and liver HDs. ELISA test of Echinococcus Granulosa titer test was negative. A primary muscular Hydatid cyst was diagnosed and a pericystectomy was chosen as the preferred surgical treatment. Treatment involved 400 mg of Albendazole twice per day for 10 days before and three months after surgery. The longitudinal incision (pericystectomy) was performed under spinal anesthesia in the anterolateral aspect of the left thigh (3). Cyst cavity was thoroughly irrigated with hypertonic saline and wound closed after putting a drain (3). The surgery has been carried out under the supervision of an attending general surgeon. Histopathological diagnosis confirmed the diagnosis of Hydatid Disease. The postoperative course of the patient was favorable. As Albendazole (400 mg twice per day) started 10 days before surgery, it was continued for three month after surgery and there was no evidence of recurrence of the lesion during the 8 month follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"We describe the case of a 60-year-old Caucasian woman with a positive familial history for dyslipidemia and nephropathy.
The patient was first hospitalized in February 2001 with: hypertension (160/100 mmHg), high lipidic values (cholesterol 372 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 267 mg/dl, triglycerides 239 mg/dl), creatininemia within the standard limits (0.9 mg/dl), a corresponding GFR of 63 ml/min calculated according to Cockroft and Gault, albuminemia of 3.15 gr/dl, total proteins of 5.7 g/dl, and a micro-hematuria, proteinuria (200 mg/dl) and proteinuria and/or albuminuria ratio of 2 g/g. The main immunological studies, ASO, rheumatoid factor, C3-C4, VDRL, serum immuno-fixation and serum immunoglobulin were normal. The serum markers for HBV, HCV and HIV were negative. The leucocyte formula was normal.
A physical examination ruled out the presence of xanthelasma and corneal arc in the absence of edemas. An ultrasound revealed kidneys which were regular in dimension and structure.
A renal biopsy showed the presence of lipid deposits in the glomerular lumens under the optical microscope after staining with Red-O oil. The interstitium showed a diffuse fibrous edema and tubular atrophy in the areas of fibrosis with a moderate infiltration of inflammatory cells. An arteriole showed hyaline deposits. An immunofluorescence revealed the presence of deposits of IgM and C3 in the sub endothelial seat. An electronic ultrastructural analysis confirmed the presence of thrombi in the lumen of the glomerular capillary loops. The histopathological diagnosis suspected LPG, but ApoE typing identified the polymorphism (E2/2) with a diagnosis of familial type III dyslipoproteinemia.
The patient started treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg/day. We did not use fibrates in association with statin to avoid possible side effects. After one year of therapy we observed a good control of lipid values (cholesterol 250 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 114 mg/dl) and a reduction of the proteinuria (120 mg/dl). Hypertension was controlled (145/90 mmHg) by means of ACE-inhibitors (irbesartan 300 mg/day, ramipril 5 mg/day), beta-blockers (carvedilole 25 mg/day) and Ca antagonists (nifedipine 60 mg/day).
Four years later in April 2005, the patient was again hospitalized for clinically overt nephrotic syndrome with proteinuria (5 g/24 h) and renal failure (creatinine 2.2 mg/dl). Arterial hypertension (180/100 mmHg) was hardly responsive to treatment. The patient had a low response (cholesterolemia 445 mg/dl, LDL 318 mg/dl, triglycerides 292 mg/dl) to lipid-lowering drugs (atorvastatin 40 mg/day + cholestyramine 4 g/day + Omega3 fatty acids 2 g/day) with the presence of periocular thelasmas.
A renal biopsy revealed the presence of lipids with a fibrous growth of the interstitium and a percentage increase of sclerotic glomeruli with a diagnosis of LPG evolved into nephrotic syndrome (histology will be published in a manuscript in preparation and when published the reference will be provided).
In view of the patient's poor response to pharmacological treatment alone, in July 2005 we decided to associate for the first time in a patient with LPG an LDL-Apheresis protocol (three aphereses in the first two weeks, then one weekly session for two months followed by one apheresis every 15 days) with dextran sulfate columns on the basis of the evidence present in literature for the treatment of the steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. [-]
During the first LDL-apheresis (July 2005) with dextran sulphate columns (Liposorber System - Kaneka™), an anaphylactoid reaction occurred. This complication, as described by Olbricht in 1992 in patients undergoing treatment with ACE inhibitors and an LDL-apheresis regimen with dextran sulphate columns, is due to the inhibition of kininases that metabolize bradikynin [].
To avoid stopping the anti-hypertension treatment with ACE-inhibitors we decided to use another LDL-apheresis procedure: the extracorporeal precipitation of LDL-cholesterol induced by heparin in acid pH (HELP System, B. Braun Avitum™ Melsungen Germany). This procedure does not involve complications linked to the use of ACE-inhibitors, following the same protocol previously described.
The effects of a single HELP-apheresis on vascular homeostasis is a simultaneous, drastic reduction within two hours of cholesterol (-52%), LDL-cholesterol (-56%), VLDL-cholesterol (-52%), oxLDL (-47%), Lp(a) (-55%), triglycerides (-50%), fibrinogen (-56%), thrombin (-55%), von Willebrand factor (-56%), factor V (-57%), factor VII (-35%), PCR (-56%), plasma viscosity (-14%), erythrocyte aggregability (-60%), and thrombocyte aggregability (-60%). Also reported in the long-term treatment was an increase of HDL-cholesterol (+14%), peripheral muscle oxygenation (+33-50%), coronary flow reserve (+14%), and cerebral CO2 reactivity (+14%) [].
In the LDL/fibrinogen apheresis procedure (HELP-apheresis), the plasma is obtained by filtration of the whole blood through a 0.55 μm pore-size filter and then mixed continuously in a 1:1 ratio with a solution of a 0.2 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.85) containing 100 IU/ml (300,000 UI) of heparin. The pH of the plasma-buffer solution reaches 5.12 and, at this value, the heparin binds the LDL-cholesterol, Lp(a), fibrinogen and triglycerides forming aggregates. These aggregates precipitate and are retained by the precipitate filter. Precipitate filter is a 0.4 μm pore-size polycarbonate filter from which plasma free from LDL-cholesterol, Lp(a) and fibrinogen is obtained and then passed through an anion exchange filter (heparin absorber) to adsorb excess heparin. The last stage of the system (dialysis filter) restores the physiological pH of the plasma and the balance of the liquids, removing excess fluid by ultrafiltration. The liquid used for dialysis is a sterile solution with a bicarbonate concentration of 35 mmol/l. After the dialysis process, the plasma, purified of lipids and fibrinogen, is returned to the patient mixed with the haematic cell components.
We processed 3000 ml of plasma. That means about 1.4 patient plasma volumes in two hours, with HELP machine (Plasmat Futura®, B. Braun Avitum, Melsungen Germany) and a disposable kit. There were no side effects with the HELP. method, except that the patient had problematic vascular accesses leading to flow problems, So, it became necessary to modify some software parameters (most notably the ""PA minimum"" threshold; software version 2.06.01) to be able to use a 17G fistula needle for the blood withdrawal and a 20G cannula needle for the blood reinfusion during the procedure. With this configuration, the flows were relatively moderate for an LDL-apheresis (blood flow of 50 ml/min and plasma flow of 20 ml/min), to complete the treatment target of 3000 ml. After some procedures we proceeded with the use of an 18G fistula needle in re-entry, maintaining a 17G fistula needle for drawing, obtaining flows that were definitely higher (blood flow of 80-100 ml/min and plasma flows of 25-30 ml/min). By increasing the flows, there was a marked reduction in the duration of the individual procedure, super-imposable to that of a patient with good vascular accesses.
After two months of treatment with LDL-apheresis (10 procedures), the laboratory data showed a progressive increase of albuminemia (from 3.39 to 3.70 g/dl) with partial remission of proteinuria (from 3.3 to 2 expressed as urine protein to creatinine ratio. A ratio of 0.1 is normal - protein and creatinine are expressed in mg/dl); and a progressive decline in creatininemia (from 1.9 to 1.6 mg/dl). The patient's anemia was improving and her arterial pressure was well under control with a reduction of the pharmacological dose, compared to two months earlier. There was also a significant drop in the mean values of TG (from 285 to 231 mg/dl) and LDL-Cholesterol (from 178 to 158 mg/dl) with reduction of xanthelasma. Pre-apheresis fibrinogen and Lp(a) mean values did not show a significant reduction. Considering the patient's clinical condition improvement, we decided to reduce the statins dosage (from 40 to 20 mg/die) continuing LDL-apheresis protocol of one session every two weeks.
Four months after aphaeretic treatment (15 procedures), the patient's albuminemia values were maintained (3.70 g/dl), her creatinine (1.3 mg/dl) and proteinuria (ratio 1.3) were reduced and her arterial pressure was stabilized (120-80 mmHg). There was a further reduction of LDL-cholesterol (105 mg/dl) and TG (134 mg/dl) mean values, with a suspension of cholestyramine and Omega-3 fatty acids treatment and a further reduction of the xanthelasmas. The LDL-Apheresis session was reduced to one session every three weeks.
After ten months (25 procedures) the laboratory data were as follows: creatinine 1.6 mg/dl, albuminemia 4.30 g/dl, proteinuria (ratio 0.13), LDL-cholesterol 106 mg/dl and TG 154 mg/dl. The values of Lp(a) and fibrinogen are unchanged (Figure , ).
After two years of follow up, with a maintenance treatment of one LDL-apheresis session every three weeks in the last period, the mean biochemical values were: cholesterol 199 mg/dl, LDL-cholesterol 110 mg/dl, HDL-cholesterol 76 mg/dl, TG 112 mg/dl, fibrinogen 381 mg/dl, creatininemia 1.5 mg/dl, Proteinuria ratio 0.9, arterial pressure 120-80 mmHg. The pharmacological therapy is unchanged.
The sequence of the ApoE gene made in 2007 showed that the patient was homozygous for epsilon-2 allele (polymorphism E2/2 with Cys112 and Cys158 in the mature protein) and heterozygous for a novel mutation in exon 4: c.502 C>T [Arg 150>Cys of mature protein]. The mutant Apo E (ApoEMODENA) expresses a new residue of Cys in place of an Arg. This new cysteine residue could form a disulphide bridge with the other Cys residue of the E2 isoform resulting in ApoE polymerization (dominant negative effect). This phenomenon is probably the cause of both dyslipidemia and lipid thrombi in the glomerular capillaries [].","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 16 days old newborn female from Saudi Arabia was presented to the clinic with a skin defect localized on the scalp since birth. The baby did not suffer from any ailments, and her medical history was unremarkable. Her mother, 32 years old, denied any history of illnesses during her pregnancy, infection or drug intake taking including Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID) or methimazole. She completed 38 weeks of gestation, and delivered her baby via a normal vaginal delivery.
The newborn did not sustain any birth injury and did not suffer from any other abnormalities or feeding difficulties. She did not require any intensive care, and went home from hospital with her mother. Upon local examination, the defect was solitary, localized with an irregular shape and approximately 6×6 cm in size (). The lesion involved the epidermis and the upper dermis only. Neurosurgical team was involved in the care of this patient. A CT Scan of the head was performed, and no deep tissue involvement was noted.
Reconstruction solutions were offered to the parents but they insisted on non-surgical intervention. Therefore, the patient was treated with non-invasive debridement of the lesion and local therapy, including gentle water cleansing and the application of topical antibiotic ointment. 6 months later, the patient has returned for a follow up. Scar tissue has formed over the defect (). Family history revealed that none of her parents had the same condition; however, two of her sisters did, and were diagnosed with cutis aplasia. The elder one is currently 4 years of age, with right unilateral terminal reduction of the first and second toes (). The other sister was born prematurely and died shortly after birth due to cardiac anomalies.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 65-year-old female patient was referred to our hospital with complaints of swelling and nodular skin lesions on both legs. She had a history of rheumatoid arthritis and treatment with corticosteroid medication for five years. On physical examination, dark blue-purplish macular and nodular skin lesions were observed on the legs along with pretibial edema (). The lesions that had appeared within a few months were not painful. She was diagnosed with KS with biopsy of the skin lesions (). Laboratory tests were within normal limits except an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Anti-HIV antibody was negative. She was referred to our department for initial staging with 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging. A whole body 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging was performed 60 minutes after 370 megabequerel 18F-FDG injection using an integrated PET/CT scanner (Siemens, Biograph mCT, Germany). 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging showed multiple nodular skin lesions with increased FDG uptake on both legs (SUVmax: 6.1). In addition, there were hypermetabolic bilateral inguinal and popliteal lymph nodes (SUVmax: 3.6-5.6) ().","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"The first case is a 24-year-old Caucasian male that sought medical attention for priapism 24 hours after his erection began. He has a past medical history of stuttering priapism and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura diagnosed three years earlier but in remission according to his hematologist. His only previous surgery was a splenectomy. He was taking no medications at the time.
In the emergency room he received an intracorporal aspiration and injection of phenylephrine (500 µg/mL) with no detumescence. A corporal blood gas was collected which showed the following: pCO2, 89 mmHg (normal = 32–43); pO2, 32 mmHg (normal = 83–108); pH 7.20 (normal = 7.37–7.44). He was taken to the operating room where bilateral Al-Ghorab shunts were performed. In the recovery unit, he had recurrence of his erection. The patient was then transferred to our facility for further management.
His physical exam on arrival revealed a persistent erection and with pain and he was taken to the operating room. Dark venous blood was drained from his corpora. A corpora cavernosal shunt (T-shunt) with tunneling was performed using #8 Hegar dilators. Detumescence was obtained intraoperatively. The procedure was completed and the patient was transferred to the PACU without complication, yet immediately postoperatively he again became erect. A corporal blood gas was taken, with the values consistent with a high-flow state: pCO2, 47 mmHg (normal = 32–43); pO2, 106 mmHg (normal = 83–108); pH 7.27 (normal = 7.37–7.44); and 98% 02 saturation. He was observed and discharged on post-op day 2, but he continued to have an erection for approximately three weeks without pain. He was seen at 6 weeks post-op and he was having normal erectile function.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 46-year-old male with a history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis complicated by small esophageal varices after banding and moderate ascites was awaiting liver transplant (MELD 24, Child-Pugh class B). He presented with a 3-day history of abdominal pain. He described the pain as sharp and located around the periumbilical area with notable suprapubic discomfort. He also reported associated symptoms of nausea, hematochezia, and general malaise. On further review of systems, he reported chills, increased fatigue, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and decreased appetite 4 days prior to presentation. He reported compliance at home with a sodium-restricted diet and medications. Physical exam was significant for abdominal distension with positive fluid wave, generalized abdominal tenderness, and splenomegaly. Scant blood was noted on the rectal exam. Laboratory studies revealed stable hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL, hematocrit of 36.8%, platelet of 83 K/UL, leukocytosis of 15.4 K/UL with 78% neutrophils and 16% bands, sodium of 130 mmol/L, ammonia of 83 Umol/L, ALT of 40 U/L, AST of 42 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase of 127 U/L. International normalized ratio (INR) was 2.02. Diagnostic paracentesis revealed serosanguinous fluid and ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) count of 686 cells/mm3, consistent with culture negative neutrocytic ascites. Blood cultures revealed no growth of organisms. The patient was started on intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone, IV pantoprazole infusion, and an IV bolus of octreotide followed by continuous infusion. He completed a 5-day course of IV ceftriaxone therapy.
The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which showed ulcerations in the distal esophagus from prior banding of small esophageal varices and diffuse portal hypertensive gastropathy (). Mucosal edema and erythema with an area of oozing of blood were identified in the duodenum bulb and between proximally located duodenal folds with no specific identifiable lesion. These findings correlated with a diagnosis of portal hypertensive duodenopathy (). Colonoscopy was performed, and it showed no active bleeding. However, there were old blood clots in the terminal ileum in addition to mild inflammation in the terminal ileum near the ileocecal valve. Video capsule endoscopy was also performed, and it revealed no active bleeding. Because of the concern of the possible failure of the patient on medical therapy for portal hypertension while awaiting liver transplant, the patient was referred for evaluation by a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). The patient successfully underwent the TIPS procedure. Follow-up occurred one month later in clinic. At this time, the patient reported resolution of the hematochezia.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A thirty-six year-old woman became pregnant after infertility treatment consisting of ovulation stimulation and intrauterine insemination. Pregnancy was complicated by a history of cervical insufficiency (cervical cerclage in 30th week of pregnancy) and cervical infections (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus foecium—both widely susceptible) successfully treated with antibiotics.
At 34 weeks and 3 days, a gestational age premature baby girl was born by caesarean section as a first of the triplets, with birth weight 1720 g and Apgar score of 9, 8, and 9 at 1, 5, and 10 min, respectively. After delivery room stabilization, she was placed into an incubator with passive oxygen therapy. The newborn received total parenteral nutrition and trophic feeding of expressed mother’s colostrum in the first day of life, then was supported with donor human milk from the Human Milk Bank through orogastric feeding tube. On the second day of life, patient received phototherapy due to abnormal total serum bilirubin concentration (10.2 mg/dL). At the end of the third day, the infant’s health suddenly deteriorated, requiring intubation and ventilation. From the first symptoms and abnormal infections markers (high CRP—247.5 mg/L, PCT—17.14 ng/mL, low leukocyte—3.4 G/L, and platelet count—29 g/L) she was treated with meropenem (40 mg/kg/dose twice a day) and vancomycin (15 mg/kg/dose twice a day). Blood culture was positive and C. sakazakii NMI5563_17 isolate had been identified on the sixth day of life. Phenotypic detection of ESBL was carried out by the ESBL double-disc synergy test (DDST) as described previously []. The antibiotic susceptibility testing was evaluated using gradients tests and broth microdilution method for colistin (; accessed on 1 June 2021). Isolate showed resistance to ampicillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and aztreonam ().
On the fifth day of life, the platelet transfusion was performed. The culture of cerebrospinal fluid was negative. Despite appropriate antimicrobial treatment with meropenem (according to the susceptibility profile of the bacteria), the infant had developed sepsis with multiorgan failure and meningitis with multiple brain abscesses. Cerebral ultrasound showed multiple brain abscesses with disintegration tendency and complete obliteration of brain structures. The electroencephalography examination showed low voltage signal. After discussion with her parents, care was redirected to palliation, and the infant died at 12 days of age.
The other triplets (II-female 1500 g and III-male 1430 g) have been fed in the same way (orogastric tube and own mother’s breastmilk supplemented by donor milk) and were in good condition with no symptoms of infection. They were discharged after 27 days of hospitalization.
In the course of epidemiological investigation, mother’s skin (axillary and inguinal regions), hospital surfaces, and equipment were swabbed, milk samples (from mother’s breastmilk and Human Bank Milk) together with milk expressing devices including breast pump kits, underwent microbiological examination. The analysed surfaces, devices, and milk did not show Cronobacter contamination.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A proband, female, aged 10 years and 3 months, with a medical history of recurrent fever and abdominal distention prior to the age of 5 years and 9 months, was admitted to our hospital with recurrent fever and cough for 3 days. Five years and nine months before admission to our hospital (when the child patient was 4 years and 6 months old), she was diagnosed with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)–HLH due to fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, increase of ferritins and positive EBV-DNA, and thus was treated based on the HLH-2004 plan for 8 weeks. Treatment was then stopped, and the disease remained in continuous remission for 22 months. Three years and nine months before admission to our hospital, the patient was diagnosed as having a relapse of EBV–HLH due to the aforesaid symptoms and her positive blood EBV–DNA, and she was treated again by chemotherapy based on the HLH-2004 plan for 8 weeks. Symptoms relieved and she stopped taking drugs, and the duration of the disease remission reached about 19 months. Two years before admission to our hospital, the child patient developed recurrent fever and abdominal distension, which improved after receiving anti-infective therapy and taking dexamethasone (details not known) in a local clinic. She denied having a history of infectious disease and has been inoculated with hepatitis B vaccine, BCG vaccine, poliomyelitis attenuated live vaccine, diphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccine, measles attenuated live vaccine, and epidemic encephalitis B vaccine, without any abnormal reaction. The patient was born in full term, G3P3, her parents’ marriage was consanguineous (Fig. ), and the two elder brothers respectively developed recurrent fever and abdominal distension symptoms similar to the patient's at the ages of 4 and 5 years and died of treatment failure in another hospital. Specific diagnosis and treatment as well as causes of death were unknown. After admission to our hospital, the child patient had a continuous high fever (39–40 °C), with an acute serious sickly appearance, without stained yellow skin or rash, but scattered ecchymosis was found. The superficial lymph nodes were not affected but her tonsils were slightly swollen. Medium and fine moist rales were heard in her right lung. Her abdomen was distended, the liver was 3.0 and 5.0 cm below the costal margin and the xiphoid, respectively. No abnormity was found in her nervous system. The hemogram revealed pancytopenia with the neutrophils 0.29 × 109/L, Hb 52 g/L, and platelets 6 × 109/L, respectively. The fibrinogen was decreased (the lowest value was 44 mg/dL), and the ferritin was elevated (995.3 ng/mL). Her triglyceride was normal, and a hemophagocytic phenomenon was found in a bone marrow examination. Multiple etiological examinations (blood culture, fungus G test and GM test, mycobacterium tuberculosis T-SPOT, mycoplasma, chlamydia and EBV-DNA [six repeated examinations], cytomegalovirus [CMV]-DNA, TORCH and seven combined examinations of respiratory viruses) were negative. According to eight HLH clinical diagnosis standards formulated by the International Histiocyte Society in 2004, the patient was clinically diagnosed as HLH. Due to a positive family history, in order to further specify the causes of the disease, we examined the activity of NK cells, the CD107a degranulation function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells, as well as hereditary HLH-related gene mutations, and found that:
the activity of NK cells in the proband was reduced slightly, the CD107a degranulation function in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells also was obviously declined, and her parents also presented with reduced NK cell activity and slightly declined CD107a degranulation in CTL and NK cells (Fig. );
a homozygous mutation in STX11 (c.49C>T), which converted the codon encoding the glutamine amino acid at position 17 in syntaxin11 to a termination codon (p.Q17X), leading to early termination of the synthesis of syntaxin11 and loss of 240 amino acids (Fig. ).
This mutation was inherited from the parents of the proband (Figs. and ), and the result proved that the proband suffered from FHL-4. After admission to our hospital, the patient found relief after receiving treatment based on the HLH-2004 protocol; she has been alive for 6 years and 10 months since the onset, has stopped taking the dexamethasone and etoposide, but still takes cyclosporine orally to maintain treatment. She has undergone HLA matching and now is actively looking for a donor to undergo a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 69-year-old male with underlying hypertension was admitted with a complaint of general weakness started 10 days ago. The patient had been taking irbesartan 150 mg and thiazide 12.5 mg for 3 years. He had 20 pack-year history of smoking. The initial blood pressure was 128/82 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the temperature was 36℃. Chest auscultation revealed decreased breathing sound on the left upper area of chest wall.
Laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count, 8,190×109/L; hemoglobin, 16.4 g/dL; platelet count, 170×109/L; glucose level, 235 mg/dL; sodium, 141 mEq/L; potassium, 1.7 mEq/L; chloride, 88 mEq/L; lactic dehydrogenase, 863 U/L; D-dimer, 0.08 µg/L; and C-reactive peptide, 2.30 mg/L. Arterial blood gas analysis was pH 7.574, pCO2 50.1 mm Hg, pO2 122 mmHg, HCO3 40 mmol/L, and oxygen saturation was 98.8% suggesting metabolic alkalosis.
The chest radiography taken on admission showed left upper lobe atelectasis and mass like lesion infiltrating the left upper bronchus (). Chest computed tomography (CT) scans revealed about 7×5-cm-sized mass in left upper lobe showing invasion to the main pulmonary arterial trunk (). Biopsy was done with bronchoscopy and the pathology confirmed small cell carcinoma. Positron emission tomography CT showed hepatic and both adrenal gland metastases.
Our primary impression was hyperaldosteronism or pseudohyperaldosteronism according to the lab finding of hypokalemia associated with hypertension. Aldosterone and renin level being normal, hypokalemia with metabolic alkalosis in patient with lung cancer infiltrating left upper lobe suggested Cushing syndrome due to ectopic ACTH secreting tumor. The ACTH level was elevated to 535.61 pg/mL and the cortisol level was elevated to 47.43 µg/dL. The level of cortisol was not suppressed with low dose and high dose dexamethasone suppression test and the 24-hour urinary free cortisol was still elevated to 1,796.93 µg/day. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed normal pituitary gland and no cerebral metastases. The malignant tissue obtained with bronchoscopy was positive in ACTH marker stain. These finding were consistent with Cushing syndrome caused by ectopic ACTH production (). The patient had no cushingoid appearance such as moon face, skin change or central obesity, and hypokalemia was the only clinical feature to suspect diagnosis.
To reduce the high cortisol level before chemotherapy, ketoconazole (400 mg two times a day) and spironolactone were administered for EAS. As hypokalemia resolved, so did the metabolic alkalosis. It was not needed to maintain corticosteroid treatment after normalization of hypokalemia. Once ectopic ACTH production controlled, the patient was transferred to the oncology division to have systemic chemotherapy and survived for 15 months.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

There was loss of fat plane between the uterus and the thickened rectosigmoid colon with air pockets within the endometrial cavity []. Mesocolic fat and perirectal fat stranding was also seen with multiple adjacent subcentimetric lymph nodes. Based on CT findings, possibility of rectosigmoid malignancy and colouterine fistula was considered. The sigmoidoscopy and biopsy of the lesion revealed infiltrating moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of colon. The en bloc resection of the uterus and sigmoid colon with colostomy was performed on the patient and adjuvant chemotherapy started.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 24-year-old man riding a motorcycle collided with a car while turning to the right. He fell off the motorcycle after the collision, and was injured by another car. He had no previous medical history. When he was brought to our emergency department in an ambulance, his airway was patent, he was tachypneic, hypotensive, tachycardic, and his Glasgow coma scale score was 7 (E1V2M4). Intubation, bilateral chest drainage, and blood transfusion were performed. Following assessment by whole-body computed tomography (CT), he was diagnosed with bilateral pneumothorax, liver and spleen injuries, fractures of the left acetabulum, right patella and tibial plateau, with open fractures of the shaft of the right femur and distal third of the left femur (Fig. ). External fixation and irrigation of both thighs were performed in the operating room. The liver and spleen injuries were treated conservatively. After surgery, his consciousness disorder persisted. Initially, hypoxia was not accompanied by significant changes in chest radiographs; however, serial chest radiographs showed progressive bilateral pulmonary opacities consistent with ARDS (Fig. A and B). Contrast-enhanced CT also showed bilateral patchy gland glass opacity and consolidation matching chest radiographs, and there was no filling defect in pulmonary artery. Arterial blood gases on the 4th day of admission showed a PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio of 100 mmHg under 10 cm H2O of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). In addition, the patient developed subconjunctival, abdominal, and precordial petechiae (Fig. ). He remained tachycardic, febrile with a body temperature >38°C, and was jaundiced. Laboratory data showed exacerbation of anemia (hemoglobin, 9.1 × 10 g/L), decreased platelet count (88 × 109 /L), and elevated total bilirubin levels (8.9 × 10 μmol/ L). Gurd and Wilson criteria (3 major and 5 minor criteria) and Schonfeld scoring system were used for the diagnosis of FES. The criteria of both scoring systems were met, thereby supporting the positive diagnosis of FES (Table ).[
The patient had type 1 respiratory failure which gradually worsened with conventional lung-protective ventilation. Due to a persistent consciousness disorder, prophylactic antiepileptic drug administration, anticerebral edema therapy, and targeted temperature management using an intravascular temperature control catheter were performed.[ On the 6th day of admission, the Murray score was 3.5 indicating severe lung injury: P/F ratio of 81 mmHg (4 points), pulmonary edema in all lung fields on chest X-ray (4 points), PEEP of 14 cm H2O (3 points), compliance of 23.3 ml/cm H2O (3 points). Because his cardiac function was not reduced and hemodynamic status was maintained, we chose VV-ECMO over venoarterial-ECMO.[ A 23 French multi-stage drainage cannula was inserted from the left femoral vein to the inferior vena cava, and a 17 French single-stage return cannula was cannulated from the right internal jugular vein to the superior vena cava. The ECMO rotation speed was 3300 r/minute and the flow rate was 4.5 L/minute with 100%FiO2 and 4.5 L/minute sweep gas flow. Under the condition, his peripheral oxygen saturation was maintained >95% and blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.42, PO2 of 95 mmHg, and PCO2 of 46.6 mmHg. Although lung protection management was continued with high PEEP and low tidal volume after VV-ECMO introduction, improvement in respiratory condition was not observed. Therefore, we decided to convert the external fixation to internal fixation to begin prone position therapy. Osteosynthesis was performed on the 9th day of admission under VV-ECMO. In the supine position a tourniquet was applied on the left side. The lateral parapatellar approach was used to reduce the fracture and fix the screws and lateral locking plate (Fig. A). The tourniquet was released to place the screws in the proximal holes of the plate, following which there was continued congestive bleeding. Heparin had been introduced into the circuit at the beginning of the operation, but due to a large amount of blood loss, protamine sulfate, an antagonist for heparin, was administered midoperation. The bleeding was controlled by closing the left knee wound and inserting a drain. Osteosynthesis of the right femur was then performed using a retrograde intramedullary nail (Fig. B) without any serious complications. The total operation time was 4 hours and 29 minutes and the total blood loss amounted to 3800 g. Sixteen units of red blood cell transfusion, 20 units of platelet transfusion, and 16 units of fresh frozen plasma were needed. The ECMO circuit was run heparin free for 2 days postsurgery.
Prone-position ventilation was initiated on the second day postsurgery after the hemodynamics became stable. The patient was placed in the prone position for 16 hours a day. Low tidal volume ventilation (6 ml/kg) and an infusion of neuromuscular blockade was introduced. To address severe acute kidney injury due to hemolysis, we also started continuous renal replacement therapy on the 14th day. For 4 days, the patient was managed in the prone position. His respiratory condition and chest radiographs improved steadily over the 8 days following osteosynthesis, and VV-ECMO was discontinued on the 17th day (Fig. C). The ventilator was removed on the 28th day. At that time, his respiratory status improved to P/F ratio: 370, and multiple petechiae disappeared. His conscious level normalized without residual central nervous system complications.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 40-year-old male patient presented to our department with complaints of right sided neck swelling that had gradually progressed in size over the past 5 yrs. He does not give any history of hoarseness of voice, recent cough, or light headedness. He complains of difficulty swallowing and also in neck movements. On examination of the patient, a firm, immobile, nontender swelling of size 10 × 10 cm was found, which involved the right side of neck. It was seen extending from behind the right sternocleidomastoid muscle to just across the midline of neck. Vertically, it extended from the hyoid bone to the sternal end of right clavicle. It was nonpulsatile and no murmur was audible. Carotid artery was displaced clinically by the mass. Examination revealed all cranial nerves to be within normal limits. No other swellings were palpable in the neck ().
Cervical spine and thoracic X-rays were taken to see for tracheal obstruction and mediastinal shadow as well as pre-op planning. Cervical X-ray did not show any tracheal narrowing while there was a slight suspicion of mediastinal widening ().
For further characterisation of the swelling, a contrast enhanced computed tomography was done which showed presence of fairly well-defined hypodense mass lesions in the right side of neck extending to upper mediastinum. The largest lesion was approximately 4.2 × 5.4 cm in anteroposterior and transverse dimensions. The craniocaudal extent of the lesions was approx. 17.8 cm. There was poor contrast enhancement of the lesions with few mildly enhancing internal components. The upper part of the mass was abutting the pterygoid muscles and the C2 vertebrae. The lower level of the lesion was at the level of the carina. The masses in the neck were mainly involving the right carotid space displacing and separating the carotid arteries and the internal jugular vein suggestive of a neurogenic tumor. The lesions were also displacing the right SCM muscle and right submandibular gland. The thyroid and cricoid cartilages, hypopharynx, larynx, and trachea were displaced to the left without obvious evidence of erosion or infiltration. In the mediastinum, the lesion was seen to displace the azygous vein, right brachiocephalic vein, and superior vena cava and abutting the aortic arch and right main bronchus. The thyroid gland appeared normal. There was no obvious cervical lymph node enlargement, no intracranial extension, nor any obvious bone or cartilage erosion in the area of study. The present CECT was suggestive of a neurogenic tumor probably from the right vagus nerve ().
A Tc99m thyroid scintigraphy was done from another institution before presentation which showed presence of normal thyroid gland with normal uptake, but for the presence of a cold nodule in the right lobe. Under USG guidance, an FNA was done from the cold nodule in the right lobe of thyroid. FNAC result revealed a benign colloid nodule. As malignancy was ruled out, no further action was taken on the thyroid gland. The swelling in question was not evident on the scintigraphy ().
An FNA was taken from the swelling in question, which was inconclusive.
Further routine workup was done which included basic blood and renal and thyroid workup which were within normal limits, and patient was prepared for surgery.
Under general anesthesia, a collar-line transverse incision was made 1 cm below the cricoid cartilage and extending along the anterior border of the right sternocleidomastoid. After raising subplatysmal flaps, the strap muscles were separated, and the lesion was visualised. A yellowish mass lesion was visualised extending beyond the midline which appeared well-defined and well-encapsulated. It was dissected from the adjacent tissue and found to have posterior attachment to the ipsilateral vagus nerve. The vagus nerve was splayed over its surface and carefully dissected off the swelling, thereby preserving the whole of the nerve. There was an episode of bradycardia during this manoeuvre, but it was transient and the rest of the procedure was uneventful ().
After successful removal of the lesion, there were multiple other similar swellings seen discontinuous from the first, along the vagus nerve, proximal and distal to the first swelling. They were also dissected away from the vagus nerve and removed in toto. Lesions involving the submandibular area were also resected. The mediastinal lesion seen on imaging was removed along with the first specimen via the same incision itself. Hemostasis was ensured and the wound was closed in layers after placing a suction drain. The patient had an uneventful postoperative period and was discharged on the 5th post-op day. There was no obvious evidence of vagus nerve injury, no hoarseness, or cough ().
In total, there were 5 specimens, of which one was a lymph node from level 2 that was also excised ().
Final histopathology report showed the presence of schwannoma with degeneration, composed of focal hypercellular (Anthony A) areas and hypocellular areas (Anthony B). Immunohistochemical examination of tumor cells showed strong S-100 positivity. Therefore, a final diagnosis of vagal nerve schwannomatosis was obtained. The lymph node was histologically unremarkable.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"Case 1 is a 32-year-old woman originating from Yunfu City in Guangdong Province, China. She was referred to our hospital for a routine prenatal examination at the 18th week of gestation and then underwent thalassemia screening. Case 2 is a 51-year-old man from Guangzhou City in Guangdong Province. He attended our hospital for routine partner testing for thalassemia. These two cases were from unrelated families. Both agreed to participate in our study and signed informed consent forms. All studies were approved by the Ethics Committee of Guangdong Women and Children Hospital.
Blood samples were collected and hematological parameters were determined using a Sysmex XN5000 automated hematology analyzer (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan). Hb analysis was conducted with an automated capillary 2 electrophoresis system (Sebia, Lisses, France). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using the Lab-Aid 820 automation system (Zee San Biotech Company, Fujian, China). Twenty-three mutations common in individuals from southern China were routinely measured in our laboratory by a suspension array system, as previously described. α1-, α2-, and β-globin genes were independently amplified by PCR using previously described primer pairs, then PCR products were purified and sequenced by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The sequences were compared with National Centre for Biotechnology Information reference sequences (HBA1: NC_000016.10: 176680-177522; HBA2: NC_000016.10: 172876-173710; HBB: NC_000011.10: 5225464-5227071) using Sequence Scanner software (Applied Biosystems).
Hematological indices and genotypes are summarized in . Both samples showed characteristics of microcytic and hypochromic erythrocytes. Iron deficiency was excluded (data not shown). In both cases, capillary electrophoresis (CE) revealed an abnormal Hb X fraction which was close to the Hb A peak and easily identified, even if partial overlap persisted (). The suspension array system determined that both cases carried heterozygous (- - SEA/) deletions for α-thalassemia and were negative for β-thalassemia (data not shown). DNA sequencing detected a substitution (HBA1: c.343C>G) at codon 114 of HBA1 that was previously reported as Hb Broomhill (), which was consistent with CE results. No other mutation with clinical significance was observed in either of the cases. Eventually, the two patients were diagnosed with compound heterozygosity for Hb Broomhill and the (- - SEA/) α-thalassemia deletion.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 36-year-old gravida 5 para 3013 was referred to our fetal treatment centre at 24 weeks of gestation with a fetal diagnosis of congenital high airway obstruction syndrome (CHAOS) without additional anomalies (). Fetal imaging revealed a gap in the trachea, but sufficient tracheal length was present to permit access for tracheostomy. Fetal cytogenetics from an amniotic fluid sample revealed a normal karyotype and microarray. In a multidisciplinary conference involving the family, options were discussed to include termination of pregnancy, delivery with neonatal comfort care and an EXIT-to-airway procedure. The family was well informed that without an established airway at the time of delivery, a neonatal demise would be imminent. Fetoscopic laser decompression of CHAOS, feasible in select cases, was not considered in this scenario secondary to the long gap defect noted on fetal imaging, which would result in a low likelihood of a successful procedure, as well as the associated risks of surrounding tissue injury. Prematurity is also higher following fetoscopic procedures, and an EXIT procedure remains necessary regardless of decompression to develop an adequate airway at delivery. The family elected for a re-evaluation in the third trimester and returned at 31 weeks of gestational age for a repeat ultrasound and fetal MRI. She received weekly ultrasounds at the referring centre to determine fetal viability, monitor amniotic fluid volume and assess for signs of premature labour until she relocated to our centre. Findings on follow-up remained stable when compared with her earlier evaluation, with the exception of asymptomatic polyhydramnios.
After follow-up counselling, the family elected to undergo an EXIT-to-airway procedure scheduled for 37 weeks of gestation. At this point, a call tree was established placing all key specialties on 24-hour availability until the procedure was completed. The gestational age chosen for the procedure was established to allow for further fetal growth and to promote fetal lung maturity.
At 34 weeks 5 days of gestation, she presented to labour and delivery at 03:00 on a Sunday morning with the complaint of gross rupture of membranes. On examination, her cervix was noted to be 4 cm dilated; there was gross pooling of amniotic fluid; and the umbilical cord was prolapsed through the cervix up to the level of the introitus (). The fetus was in the breech presentation. Contractions were occurring regularly at 4 min intervals with persistent variable fetal heart rate decelerations down to 80 beats/min. The call tree was activated. The patient was taken to the operating room and underwent general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation, while the multidisciplinary team congregated to discuss adjustments to the procedure. The time from patient presentation in labour and delivery triage to induction of general anaesthesia was 59 min, with all essential team members present.
The decision was made to make a maternal midline laparotomy to provide sufficient access to completely exteriorise the late-preterm gravid uterus and to make a fundal hysterotomy to deliver the fetal head and neck first. The placenta was anterior, and the fetus was in the breech presentation in the setting of anhydramnios secondary to rupture of membranes. An attempt at external cephalic version was not deemed safe in the setting of anhydramnios, active labour and existing cord prolapse. For these reasons, the original plan to perform a maternal abdominal transverse skin incision with a low transverse uterine hysterotomy was therefore abandoned. The midline skin incision was made to just below the umbilicus with placement of a large Olexis O retractor (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, Californis, USA) allowing the uterus to be exteriorised. The anaesthesiologist provided maximal halogenated agents with a mean alveolar concentration of 3, along with both nitroglycerin and terbutaline. Unfortunately, uterine relaxation was not sufficient to maintain optimal placental perfusion to the fetus. In an effort to expedite the procedure, the surgical team proceeded by placing a haemostatic myometrial box stitch at the fundus placed well away from the placental edge. The uterus was incised within the box stitch with electrocautery, and the amniotic sac was entered. Bainbridge clamps were used to compress the myometrium prior to placing uterine haemostatic staplers. Due to inadequate uterine relaxation, the thickened myometrium prohibited sufficient compression of tissue to allow for stapling. At this point, the uterine entry point was extended with electrocautery, and Allis clamps were used along the length of the hysterotomy to provide haemostasis. The fetal head and neck were then delivered followed immediately by an intramuscular injection of a cocktail containing atropine, rocuronium and fentanyl. A rapid intravenous infusion device was used to infuse warm lactated Ringer’s solution through the hysterotomy to assist in maintaining uterine volume. Fetal monitoring performed throughout the procedure by fetal cardiology demonstrated intermittent bradycardia with rate as low as 88 beats/min and as high as 129 beats/min with depressed biventricular function. At this time, the paediatric surgeon and paediatric otolaryngologist worked in concert and established an airway via an endotracheal tube through a tracheostomy incision. The time from delivery of the head and neck until airway establishment was 3 min. The remainder of the baby was delivered; the umbilical cord was clamped and cut; and the infant was passed off to the neonatology team.
The neonatal response to initial resuscitation was an immediate return to a heart rate in the 150’s bpm with an oxygen saturation of 100%. After stabilisation, bronchoscopy revealed laryngeal atresia below the level of the vocal cords with an intact trachea ().
The parturient was extubated after the placement of bilateral transversus abdominus plane blocks for postoperative pain control. Unfortunately, during the first 24 hours postpartum, the mother developed uterine atony necessitating the use of uterotonics and uterine balloon tamponade. She received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells. Subsequently, the mother remained inpatient for three postoperative days and was discharged in good condition without further complications from the surgical procedure.
The infant is doing well and remains with a tracheostomy awaiting definitive repair of the laryngeal atresia.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 70-year-old male, with history of hypertension, dislipidemia, and hyperuricemia, presented to our institution with a one-year long history of progressive and intense lower lumbar pain causing great limitation of daily activities. Physiotherapy or medication was ineffective. The patient reported a palpable mass on this region for years but with neither symptoms nor size progression. He had no constitutional or neurologic symptoms. On examination, there were tenderness over the central and left paraspinal area and a fixed palpable mass of size approximately 7 × 5 cm, hard in consistency, and no pulse. The pain aggravated with flexion, extension, and rotational trunk movements. Neurologic examination was normal. Radiographs showed a bony mass protruding posteriorly, apparently from the L5 vertebra. CT scan showed a 7 cm long well-limited mass with an apparent cartilage cap arising from the spinous process of L5. It was lateralized to the left with adjacent paraspinal muscle compression (). Under general anesthesia, the tumor was marginally resected along with the L5 spinous process through a posterior approach (). Histologic examination has shown a specimen composed of trabecular bone with focus on bone marrow covered by lobules of cartilaginous tissue, without cellular atypia, consistent with osteochondroma (). After surgery pain was completely relieved, and neurologic function was normal.

"The 37-year-old woman presented with a three-month history of continuous pain in the right shoulder and chest. She was taken to our department of cardiothoracic surgery. Physical examination was remarkable for palpable lymph nodes in the bilateral supraclavicular fossae. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed an oval mass located in the anterior mediastinum. Circumambient lung tissue was involved. Haematological findings were: WBC 15.40 × 109/L, platelets 364 × 109/L, prothrombin time 10.3 sec. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), blood biochemistry, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, urine analysis and the endocrine profile were within normal range except hemoglobin (106 g/L) and tumor specific growth factor (67 U/ML). The abdominal ultrasonography did not reveal any other abnormality.
The surgery was performed with the patient under general anesthesia and left lateral decubitus position. The procedure revealed an oval tumor, volume of which was 7 cm × 4.5 cm × 2.5 cm, in the anterior mediastinum and circumambient lung tissue was involved. Pathologic findings during surgery showed that the tumor was off-white with obscure boundaries and hard in consistence (Figure ). The result of pathology hinted that the tumor maybe malignant lymphoma. The tumor and circumambient lung tissue which was involved were excised.
Histology showed the tumor was nodular and different nodules were separated by collagen fibers (Figure ). There were two morphologically and immunophenotypically distinct components. The great mass of nodules showed a pleomorphic cellular infiltrate containing lymphocyte, eosinophile granulocyte, neutrophile granulocyte and numerous large Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg cells. The Reed-Sternberg cells were positive for CD30, CD15 and MUM1 but negative for CD20, CD79a, CD3, Pax-5, CD68, bcl-6, CD10, CD45, Igκ, Igλ and epithelial membrane antigen (Figure , Figure ). Other nodules displayed sheets of relatively uniform large lymphoid cells with typical morphologic features of large cell lymphoma which showed uniform expression of CD20, CD79a, MUM1, CD45, Igλ, Pax-5 and absence of CD30, CD15, CD3, CD10, bcl-6, Igκ, CD68 and epithelial membrane antigen (Figure , Figure ). All the primary antibodies are listed in Table . Neither cell population showed makers of EBV infection by EBER in situ hybridization (PanPath Company, Amsterdam, Netherlands). On the basis of histomorphology at light microscopy, the presence of immunohistochemical staining and in situ hybridization, a diagnosis of CL, combination of NSHL and DLBCL, in the anterior mediastinum was made. The patient received six courses of CHOP chemotherapy (a course of treatment every two weeks) and twenty three times radiotherapy (Gross Tumor Volume, GTV = 40Gy/20f; Planning Target Volume, PTV = 36 Gy/20f). After treatment, lymph nodes in the bilateral supraclavicular fossa disappeared. The total follow-up period was thirty three months after surgery. The repeated CT scans, abdominal ultrasonography and tumor specific growth factor every three months revealed no recurring or residual lesion.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 31-year-old, ASA II, superobese male patient (190 kg, 180 cm, BMI: 58 kg/m2) was admitted to the emergency department with a segmental Gustilo-Anderson type IIIA open tibial fracture and ankle dislocation following an in-vehicle traffic accident. The initial proper management of open fracture and joint dislocation was performed by orthopaedic and traumatology surgeons in the emergency department. The patient had no history of additional diseases. The preoperative airway examination revealed a class 3 Mallampati airway and, in light of the difficulty of intubation, an intrathecal block with a 150 mm needle was planned. After the written consent was obtained, 2 mg IV midazolam and 50 μg fentanyl were administered for sedation. The vertebral anatomical structures were barely distinguishable despite ultrasound guidance. After two unsuccessful attempts, we decided not to use spinal anesthesia and planned to perform a combined sciatic and femoral nerve block. As a tourniquet was not required above the knee, the blockade of these two nerves would be adequate for surgical anesthesia.
Before the femoral nerve block, the pannus was taped cephalad as the fatty tissue hanging from the abdomen made it difficult to access the inguinal region. The femoral nerve was identified at a depth of 5 cm with a linear US probe (Esaote, 10–18 MHz, Florence, Italy). Fifteen mL (8 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine and 7 mL of 2% lidocaine) of local anesthetic mixture was administered around the femoral nerve using the in-plane approach. Due to the difficulties in situating the patient in the prone position, the distal extremities of the patient were elevated with folded blankets in the supine position (). The sciatic nerve could not be visualized despite several attempts using both linear and convex probes; therefore separate blocks of the tibial and common peroneal nerves were planned. The tibial nerve was identified in the popliteal fold, posterior to the popliteal artery at a depth of 3 cm (). Visualization of the tibial nerve was highly difficult in areas more proximal than the point 2 cm above the popliteal fossa. The common peroneal nerve (CPN) and the bifurcation of the sciatic nerve could not be visualized despite several attempts using both linear and convex probes. Therefore, 10 mL (7 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine and 3 mL of 2% lidocaine) of local anesthetic mixture was administered around the tibial nerve 2 cm above the popliteal fold by using a linear probe. Screening was performed in the distal direction over the lateral side of the patient's leg with the linear probe placed transversely on the edge of the patella to identify the CPN (). The nerve was visualized posteriorly and laterally to the fibular head, 4 cm distally to the edge of the patella at a depth of 2 cm (). At this level, 10 mL (7 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine and 3 mL of 2% lidocaine) of local anesthetic mixture was administered around the nerve with the in-plane technique using a linear probe. A 100 mm 21-G echogenic needle (Pajunk, Geisingen, Germany) was used for all blocks. A nerve stimulator was not used for any blocks since the patient had extremity pain associated with trauma. Surgical anesthesia was established within 30 minutes after anesthetic administration and no complications occurred in association with the blocks. Emergent reduction and fixation with an external fixator were performed for the ankle dislocation and fracture of the tibia. Additional local anesthetic injection or additional sedation was not required during the operation. The operation lasted for approximately 1.5 hours and was completed without problems. The patient's consent was obtained for the publication of this case report.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 30 years old male patient presented to the hospital with a 2-day history of high-grade fever and headache. Headache was diffuse, moderate to severe in intensity, associated with pain and stiffness in neck, photophobia and vomiting. Condition was not associated with blurring of vision, double vision, vomiting, loss of consciousness or convulsions. There was no history of sore throat, cough, ear pain, ear discharge, motor weakness, sensory weakness, hearing difficulty, altered level of consciousness, abnormal jerky movements or skin rashes. Patient also reported persistent colorless discharge from nose and postnasal drip for 4 months. There was no history of ear fullness, persistent headache or head trauma. Patient was non-smoker and there was no history of alcohol use.
6 weeks ago, patient was discharged from hospital after being treated as bacterial meningitis. The CSF examination for viral PCR and bacterial gram stain/culture was negative. He was treated with a 14-day course of intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone. He had complete recovery of symptoms without any neurological sequalae. During hospital stay at that time, he underwent MRI head which showed large bony defect in the sellar floor with soft tissue in the anterior aspect of the sella with infrasellar extension into the left sphenoid sinus ). Neurosurgery and otorhinolaryngology teams were consulted, and an elective endoscopic endonasal/open repair of the skull base defect was planned as outpatient after resolution of meningitis. Patient still had persistent rhinorrhea during this presentation as he did not undergo repair of bony defect of sellar floor.
Physical examination revealed a young adult well oriented to time, place and person. He was febrile with temperature of 38.9 degrees Celsius. Pulse, blood pressure and respiratory rate was normal. There were no skin rashes or scratch marks. GCS was 15/15. He had normal cranial nerves, motor and sensory examination. Neck stiffness, Kernig’s and Brudzinski’s signs were positive. Cardiovascular, chest and abdominal examination was normal.
Complete blood count revealed neutrophilic leukocytosis with raised C reactive protein. Urea, creatinine, electrolytes and liver function tests were normal. Lumbar puncture was performed and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed high white blood cell count with predominance of neutrophils, high protein and low glucose (). Viral PCR of CSF was negative. CSF culture showed gram negative coccobacilli () identified as Pasteurella multocida sensitive to ceftriaxone, ampicillin and penicillin. Blood cultures were negative. After confirmation of the organism, a retrospective history of contact with dogs, cats or other animals was taken which revealed that he often used to feed stray cats who lived around his house. However, there was no history of cat scratches, bites, licks or kisses on any part of the body. Patient was treated with IV ceftriaxone 2 g twice a day for 14 days with complete resolution of his symptoms.

"A 55-year old male presented to an academic medical center in February 2020 with a six-week history of increasing midline back pain. He had a history of chronic mid- and lower back pain as the result of degenerative disc disease, however his pain had abruptly worsened in the 6 weeks prior to presentation. Pain was worsened with trying to sit up straight or walk. Pain was partially relieved with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and oxycodone 5 mg tablets taken as needed. He reported no associated fevers, chills, or night sweats. He did not recall a febrile illness prior to the onset of symptoms. He did report anorexia and 15-pound weight loss in the last 6 weeks. His medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic hepatitis C infection, hyperlipidemia, generalized anxiety disorder, and lumbar degenerative disc disease. His surgical history was notable for cervical spine laminectomy in the remote past. His social history was notable for heavy and ongoing tobacco use with a 60 pack-year smoking history. He denied alcohol or illicit drug use including intravenous drug use.
He was afebrile and hemodynamically stable on presentation. Physical exam revealed a gaunt Caucasian male in moderate distress due to pain. Poor dentition was noted. His cardiopulmonary examination was unremarkable. On spinal examination, no bony tenderness was elicited upon palpation of the thoracic and lumbar spine, however paraspinal tenderness was noted in the lumbar spine. Neurologic examination including strength and sensation of the lower extremities was intact. Babinski reflex was downward bilaterally.
MRI with and without gadolinium contrast revealed abnormal enhancement of the lower endplate of the L2 vertebral body as well as diffuse enhancement of the L3 vertebral body with irregularity of the upper endplate. This abnormal enhancement extended to the intervertebral disc. Findings were suggestive of discitis with osteomyelitis not excluded. Additionally, there was enhancement and thickening in the anterior epidural space measuring 2 mm × 4 mm which may represent epidural abscess or hematoma (Fig. ). Laboratory evaluation including CBC with differential and comprehensive metabolic panel was unremarkable. Sedimentation rate was 36 mm/hr. and C-reactive protein was 30.1 mg/L. Blood cultures were sterile.
Based on initial results of clinical, laboratory, and radiographic evaluation, antibiotic therapy was withheld. CT-guided aspiration of the L2-L3 disc was performed for culture and histopathology. Gram stain revealed Gram variable rods. Histopathology revealed fibrocartilage with degenerative changes and acute inflammation suggestive of discitis (Fig. ). He was seen in Infectious Diseases outpatient consultation, initially offered intravenous antibiotic therapy however patient requested oral antibiotic therapy for empiric treatment of discitis. He was started on treatment with cephalexin 1 g by mouth three times a day as well as linezolid 600 mg by mouth twice a day. (Initially, prior to the revelation of RBF infection, linezolid was chosen (in addition to cephalexin) because Gram stain revealed Gram-positive rods. The intention was to cover Corynebacterium spp. and coagulase-negative staphylococci, skin flora which tend to have resistance to beta-lactams but susceptibility to vancomycin or linezolid.) Cultures were sent to a reference laboratory, with growth noted on Mueller-Hinton media with 5% sheep blood. The organism was identified as Streptobacillus moniliformis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF). On further history, it was revealed that patient had two pet rats and had sustained numerous bites in the last 1 year prior to symptom onset. In vitro susceptibility testing using broth microdilution revealed low MIC for penicillin (< 0.06 μg/ml), ampicillin (< 0.12 μg/ml), and ceftriaxone (< 0.06 μg/ml), with elevated MIC > 4 μg/mL for gentamicin. The patient’s symptoms dramatically improved with cephalexin so a decision was made not to switch to oral or IV penicillin. Linezolid was discontinued after 2 weeks once culture results were available. He completed 6 weeks of oral cephalexin therapy with dramatic improvement of back pain. The patient was offered TEE to evaluate for endocarditis. However, he declined to have the test done as this coincided with the onset of CoVID-19 pandemic.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year. Exclusion Criteria: Younger than 65 years old, having decompensated liver disease, psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance, having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy.",0.5
"Seventeen year old boy with mass lesion in the right neck and weight loss attended to the hospital. He had a family history of malignancy in his sister. He had bilateral exophtalmos, cervical lymphadenopathy approximately 3 cm in diameter, icterus and ulcers in the scalp in physical examination.
Computed Tomography
The computed tomography images were obtained by a 64 channel multidetector CT device (Aquilion 64, Toshiba Medical Systems, Japan) with intravenous contrast medium administration and with slice thickness of 0.5 mm. The images were reconstructed in axial, coronal and sagittal planes and interpreted in soft tissue and bone windows.
Computed tomography examination revealed multiple cervical, anterior mediastinal conglomerated lymph nodes and bilateral pulmonary nodules. Additionally lytic lesions in the corpus of T7, T10 and destruction of T2 vertebra by a soft tissue mass were reported in the diagnostic CT ().
Bone Scintigraphy
The bone scintigraphy was performed by a double head single photon emission tomography (SPECT) gamma camera (GE, Infinia II, Israel) equipped with low energy high resolution parallel hole collimator. After intravenous administration of 20 mCi (740 MBq) (according to the body weight) Tc-99m methylene diphosphonate (MDP) and waiting period of 2-3 hours, routine whole body, and additional spot images were obtained. Asymmetrical increased tracer accumulation in unexpected sites without history of previous trauma or surgery was accepted as disease extent.
Bone scintigraphy showed multiple increased activity in predominantly cranium, bilateral ribs and pelvic region () however, there was no sign of vertebral involvement; neither decreased nor increased activity accumulation.
PET/CT Imaging
The patient fasted for 12 hours before PET/CT examination and his blood glucose concentration was 124 mg/dL. Imaging was performed by a PET/CT scanner (Siemens Biograph, 6 slice spiral CT integrated PET/CT, Siemens Medical System) after injection of 10 mCi (370 MBq) 18F-FDG and 60 minutes waiting interval. CT was performed from head to thigh with a slice thickness of 5.0 mm. For semi-quantitative assessment, regions of interests (ROIs) were produced. The maximum SUV (SUVmax) value was measured from ROI according to the standard formula. PET and CT datasets and fusion images were interpreted by an experienced nuclear medicine physician.
In the PET/CT images there were multiple hypermetabolic areas bilaterally in cervical region, mediastinal, abdominal and pelvic lymph nodes, anterior mediastinal mass () and in all the bone lesions identified in bone scintigraphy and CT , ). Additionally orbital involvement of the LCH is observed as increased FDG accumulation in the left orbita and the soft tissue component in CT (). Excisional biopsy of cervical lymph node revealed Langerhans cell histiocytosis. In the biopsy specimen there were atypical histiocytes infiltrating the whole lymph node, giant cells and microabcesses were present. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positivity of CD3, CD8, CD5, CD20, CD15, CD68, S-100, Vimentin, LCA and CD1a and negativity of CD10, Pan CK, EMA, Fascin, CD38 and CD138.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"The patient was a 34-year-old African American US-born single female. At the time of the investigation she was unemployed and lived temporarily with her mother, who had a history of paranoid schizophrenia. The patient was brought to the psychiatry emergency room by ambulance for evaluation of aggression. Upon presentation, the patient described an altercation with her mother's landlady, hitting her numerous times in the face with a closed fist. The patient started the altercation because she felt that the landlady practiced voodoo and had cursed her, causing her hair to fall off. She described an overwhelming rage prior to the physical assault. The patient did not show any remorse for her actions: “I hate her,” “I did the right things,” and “She is evil” are examples of statements made by the patient. Collateral information from the patient's mother revealed that the patient had not been compliant with her medications. She refused to follow up with outpatient care after the last inpatient admission ten months previously. The patient denied auditory hallucinations but appeared to be internally preoccupied. She denied visual and tactile hallucinations, thought insertion, and thought broadcasting. She reported an unchanged pattern of sleep and appetite, which she described to be “good.” Prior to this episode, the patient had been under economic and emotional stress. She lost her job as a nurse aide five months earlier and had not been able to secure another job since then. The patient broke up with her fiancée ten months previously after cutting her fiancée's stepfather's face following verbal altercation. There was no symptom suggestive of mania, seizure disorder, head trauma, loss of consciousness, cerebrovascular accident, Parkinson's disease, anxiety, or other organic brain disorder. The patient denied use of nicotine, alcohol, and other psychoactive substances currently or in the past. The patient had her first inpatient psychiatry admission for acute exacerbation of paranoid schizophrenia and FAS ten months earlier. She was then treated with risperidone tablets with improvement including change in accent on discharge, when she was less psychotic. The patient had a family history of sickle cell disease (brother had sickle cell disease) and schizophrenia (brother, mother, and uncle had schizophrenia). Birth and developmental history were unremarkable. There were no reported behavioral or learning disabilities, and the patient denied being a victim of emotional, physical, or sexual abuse. She had some college education and worked as a nurse aide up till five months prior to presentation to the hospital.
Mental status examination showed a middle-aged, well-groomed, dark-haired woman with poor eye contact and in no apparent distress. The patient was tangential and preoccupied with “voodoo” and was deeply paranoid of her neighbors and her mother's landlady. Auditory hallucinations were not elicited, and she denied suicidal ideation at the time of evaluation. The patient continued to endorse homicidal ideation towards her mother's landlady. She was awake, alert, orientated in time, place, and person, and attentive and had good concentration but had poor impulse control. Her insight and judgment were impaired. Immediate recall and short- and long-term memory were intact.
The physical examination of the patient showed no significant pathological findings. Laboratory investigations were unremarkable. Electroencephalogram showed no seizure activity. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR angiography of the head were both unremarkable.
The patient presented with a British-like accent, despite never having lived in Britain, and was therefore investigated by a speech therapist. There was no phonetic problem or grammatical errors, but there was a problem with prosody, including prominence of the pitch of the words and syllables. The patient's pitch range was narrow, as she sparingly expressed any emotions during speech. Her speech was monotonous, hesitant, and of low volume. She substituted “th” for “f” and “w” for “wh” as well as “t” for “d” and “ai” for “ei.”
The patient was diagnosed according to DSM-V criteria with paranoid schizophrenia, chronic condition with acute exacerbation, and in addition FAS. The diagnosis of schizophrenia was made based on disorganized speech, specifically tangentiality, paranoid delusions, and grossly disorganized behavior, which lasted for more than ten months and affected the level of functioning, specifically with regard to interpersonal relations and occupation. This was determined not to be due to illicit drug use or known medical illness.
The patient was discharged from the previous hospitalization ten months earlier with a prescription of disintegrating tablets of risperidone. However, she was not compliant with this compound after discharge and also refused to take it during the second hospital admission described here. The patient agreed to take olanzapine tablets to address her psychosis. She was offered a readily dissolvable formula, as we had concern she was “checking” her medications to spit out after administration. However, the patient refused to take any other medication than conventional olanzapine tablets. The olanzapine serum concentration could not be controlled, because the patient became more delusional and refused further blood work. The patient continued to have psychotic symptoms and her foreign accent remained unchanged. She refused augmentation with any other antipsychotic medication because of paranoia. In the course of treatment, the patient continued to endorse homicidal ideation, paranoid ideation towards her mother's landlady, and still spoke in a British accent. In view of unremitting psychotic symptoms, she was transferred to a long-term psychiatric inpatient facility.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 32-year-old Caucasian male presented to the Ophthalmology Service at the Rocky Mountain
Regional Veterans Affairs Medical Center for evaluation of several months of bilateral eye
redness and blurry vison. Review of systems was notable for simultaneous onset of diffuse
erythema, tenderness, induration, and pruritus of a large black ink tattoo over the right
arm and chest (). This
tattoo was inked 1 year prior to presentation. He had 2 other tattoos completed 10 years
before, which were unaffected ().
At the time of initial presentation, ophthalmological examination with slit lamp revealed
anterior chamber inflammation and iris synechiae. On optical coherence tomography, there was
evidence of macular edema (). Skin examination was significant for inflammation, induration, and scant
desquamation in a pattern that closely matched the borders of the tattoo. Lungs were clear
to auscultation. The rest of the history and physical examination was unremarkable.
No clinical or serological evidence for other uveitis-associated diseases was elicited,
including infections, sarcoidosis, or spondylarthritis. Comprehensive metabolic panel,
complete blood count, urinalysis, thyroid stimulating hormone, free T4, ferritin, creatine
phosphokinase, and aldolase tests were within normal limits. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
was 13 mm/h, and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme concentration was 86 U/L (14-82).
C-reactive protein, HLA-B27, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody
(including cytoplasmic, perinuclear, and atypical ANCA), lysozyme, QuantiFERON, HIV,
hepatitis B and C serologies, rheumatoid factor, anticyclic citrullinated peptide
antibodies, and computed tomography of the chest were all within normal limits. Punch
biopsies of the affected skin were obtained. Histological examination revealed granulomatous
inflammation with associated tattoo ink deposition consistent with foreign body-type
granulomatous reaction ().
Melan A immunostain highlighted scattered single junctional benign melanocytes with control
samples staining appropriately.
The patient was initially treated with topical ocular glucocorticoids without significant
improvement. He then required oral methylprednisolone 24 mg daily, tapered to 4 mg daily
over 6 days. This agent led to rapid resolution of the inflammatory tattoo changes, but not
of the macular and optic disc edema. A sub-tenon’s triamcinolone injection to both eyes
resolved his ocular manifestation; however, tapering of his systemic glucocorticoids caused
his tattoo manifestations to reappear. Adalimumab at 40 mg subcutaneously every other week
satisfactorily terminated all of his symptoms. Unfortunately, after 3 months of therapy,
patient developed an injection site reaction. Certolizumab 200 mg SQ every 2 weeks was
instituted. A follow-up examination 4 months later revealed minimal, if any, subtle
inflammation in both eyes, mild worsening of the macular edema in his left eye, and visual
acuity of 20/20 by Snellen chart.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 64-year-old woman presented to the emergency department after falling when she tripped on a rock while doing yard work. Physical examination revealed an open deformity of the left forearm (). Radial pulse was palpable, sensation was intact, and she had normal range of motion of the fingers. While awaiting radiographs, bedside ultrasound was performed ().
Ultrasound revealed intact radius and ulna and a large linear foreign body. The wooden foreign body was removed at the bedside () and patient was admitted for observation and intravenous antibiotics.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 63-year-old Caucasian male presented with a one-week history of uncontrolled choreiform movements of his left upper extremity. As described by the patient, his left arm began “jerking uncontrollably out of nowhere” while working in his shed at home. Prior to this development, the patient stated he had one similar episode a year ago which lasted for two days and resolved spontaneously. He did not seek evaluation at that time. His past medical history consisted of uncontrolled insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension, schizoaffective disorder, and polysubstance abuse in remission. He reported having diabetes mellitus for at least 10 years. Reviewing the medical records, his previous HbA1C readings ranged from 13.8% to 12.4% over a 12-month span prior to his admission. His average blood sugar readings over this time ranged from 300 to 350 mg/dl. BMI was 25.3 kg/m2. His home insulin regimen included 10 units of NovoLog three times a day with meals and Lantus 20 units every morning. He was not on any oral diabetic medications. The patient reported that he was not compliant with his home insulin medications. Notably for comparison, an MRI brain performed 5 months before for a fall did not reveal any abnormalities. He denied any recent medication changes, illnesses, or headaches. His ESR and CRP were elevated, and his initial glucose level was 339 mg/dl. HbA1C was 9.9% on the day of his admission. Vital signs were normal upon presentation, and physical exam was benign aside from the hemichorea movements of the left upper extremity. Our differential diagnosis included neoplastic disorders (metastatic brain disease and brain tumor), Huntington's disease, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, trauma, and drug or chemical toxicity (dopamine agonist or phenytoin). CT scan of the head showed areas of high density in the right lenticular nucleus and right caudate head. Subsequent precontrast MRI demonstrated T1 and T2 hyperintense abnormalities in the caudate nucleus portion of the right basal ganglia (). Postcontrast MRI of the brain showed no abnormal enhancement excluding the possibility of a mass lesion (). Diffusion-weighted MRI brain images did not reveal any abnormal restricted diffusion in the right basal ganglia which excluded ischemia (). All of these changes were consistent with the movement pattern he was displaying and with a diagnosis of CHBG. Other conditions that have been known to cause hyperintense imaging abnormalities on MRI such as this include various cellular respiratory toxins such as carbon monoxide, methanol, and cyanide. Leigh disease and hyperammonemia from chronic cirrhosis have also been known to cause this. Our patient did not have any history that would correlate with these alternative possibilities, and additionally, none of these alternatives have been known to present with hemichorea. Inpatient treatment consisted of restarting the patient's home insulin regimen with the addition of inpatient corrective coverage. This included Lantus 20 units every morning and 10 units of NovoLog 3 times a day with meals. The patient's symptoms eventually resolved with control of his blood sugar levels. Control was achieved over roughly 48 hours during which our patient's blood glucose levels dropped from an average of mid-300s to the 170–200 mg/dl range. The choreoathetosis progressed from continuous movements to intermittent and then finally to resolution.
Endocrinology was consulted for assistance with the patient's difficult glycemic control. During his posthospitalization outpatient course, our patient began to consistently adhere to his outpatient diabetic medications. Lantus was increased to 40 units every morning and NovoLog was increased 13 units 3 times a day with meals. His HbA1C 6 months after discharge had improved to 7.1%. There were no further occurrences of choreiform movements. This time course of events demonstrates how treatment of hyperglycemia can adequately treat and lead to complete resolution of hemichorea-hemiballismic movements in patients with CHBG. In this case, symptomatic improvement began being observed 48 hours after initiation of glucose control.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 20-year-old Hispanic male with no past medical history presented to our institution complaining of generalized weakness for 4 weeks, progressive cough with yellowish sputum, as well as persistent shortness of breath for 3 weeks, and intermittent fever and chills for 3–5 days prior to admission. Family history was remarkable only for coronary artery disease in his father. He denied smoking, alcohol, and using illegal drugs. He had lived with his girlfriend for 2 years and stated to be monogamous over this period. He reported a total of two sexual partners in his life. He was born in Texas and had not traveled outside the US for the last 12 years. Physical examination revealed a cachectic and tachypneic patient in no acute distress with bilateral diffuse crackles and rhonchi. The initial laboratory workup was within normal limits. Computed tomography of the chest () showed diffuse tree-in-bud nodularity, bronchiectasis, and thick-walled cavities in the upper lobes and moderate right simple pleural effusion. The HIV-rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test was reactive. The acid-fast bacilli sputum test was positive, and the patient was started on combination treatment for tuberculosis. The patient improved clinically over the next 3 days. The HIV Western blot test was negative; the viral load was undetectable. The CD4+ and CD8 counts were low (124 and 185, respectively) with a low CD4:CD8 ratio of 0.7. Further workup including immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin G, and immunoglobulin M levels, urine protein electrophoresis, and serum protein electrophoresis was unremarkable. The pleural fluid cytology revealed atypical lymphocytes consistent with the established diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. Further imaging of the abdomen and pelvis showed no abnormalities.
In addition, 8 weeks after discharge the patient was seen in clinic. He was taking his medication to treat tuberculosis and had regular health care follow-up. He was found to be completely asymptomatic with a CD4+ count of 188 cells/mm3. The repeated HIV test was negative, and the viral load was undetectable. After finishing his treatment for tuberculosis, he was evaluated in clinic, had a CD4+ count of 212 cells/mm3, and remained asymptomatic.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"The case we present here is about a 40-year-old man who was referred to our pain clinic with severe ischemic pain of right lower limb. The pain started gradually 10 months back and became very severe for the last 1 month. The intensity of pain was increasing in both the sitting and lying down positions and decreasing in a standing position. Many non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were tried earlier without much benefit. Over the last 1 month, the severity of the pain was so bad that the patient had to stand all the time and sitting or decubitus position was not tolerable even for 1 min. His sleep was so miserable that he had been taking small naps in that standing position leaning onto some support. He had carcinoma rectum for which he underwent abdominoperineal resection 8 years ago. There was history of smoking prior to that. After the surgery, he had been leading a near normal life driving auto rickshaw for a living until he developed the present problem. There were many gangrenous ulcers over his right thigh and leg. A computed tomography-angiogram was done previously that showed a thrombus in the right common iliac artery measuring about 9.5 cm extending up to the right superficial femoral artery with a near total occlusion of the lumen and poorly developed collaterals. He was scheduled for a conventional peripheral angiogram for deciding on the further plan. However, he could not lie down in the catheterization laboratory due to severe pain and was referred to our Department of Pain Management. We initially tried a conservative approach with a combination of oral pregabalin, diclofenac, paracetamol, and tramadol as per the standard dosage protocol for 2 days. When there was no satisfactory pain relief, we planned epidural analgesia. However, the problem here was the positioning. Patient was not able to tolerate either sitting or lateral decubitus position even for 1 min. He was somewhat comfortable only in the standing position. Considering the special situation, though not conventional, we decided to place the epidural catheter in that standing position. An intravenous line was started using an 18G venous cannula. Electrocardiogram, pulse oximeter, and non-invasive blood pressure monitors were connected. Patient was made to stand besides the operating table holding on to it for support. He was also supported by a technician from the front []. After painting and draping the back, L 4-5 inter-space was identified and local anesthesia was given with 2% lidocaine. Epidural space was engaged with 18G Tuohy needle using loss of resistance to air technique. The epidural catheter was carefully threaded and placed such that the length of the catheter was 5 cm in the epidural space. Catheter was gently aspirated to check for blood and cerebro-spinal fluid and was fixed after subcutaneous tunneling for about 5 cm []. Patient was reassured and gently placed on the operating table in the supine position. A quick test dose was given with 3 ml of 2% lidocaine with 15 mcg adrenaline confirming the epidural placement followed by a bolus of 10 ml of 1% lidocaine along with 1 ml of 7.5% sodium bicarbonate. The pain was relieved within 1 min and the vital signs were stable. Epidural infusion was maintained thereafter with a solution of 0.125% bupivacaine and dexmedetomidine 2 mcg/ml at the rate of 5 ml/h. Patient was very comfortable and slept peacefully. Next day peripheral angiogram was performed, which confirmed the findings of CT-angiogram. Balloon angioplasty was attempted after 2 days, but was not successful and an above knee amputation was performed subsequently. Epidural catheter was removed after 2 days and further pain control was achieved satisfactorily with oral medications.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"Post-mortem examination of a 15 + 2 deceased female foetus born to a 39-year-old healthy woman revealed isolated bilateral kidney agenesis. The father of the foetus was diagnosed with kidney hypoplasia and minimal change nephropathy at the age of 36 years due to persistent proteinuria. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperuricaemia, both requiring medical therapy. However, at the age of 53 years, kidney function was only mildly impaired. The father has a strong family history of kidney disease ().
DNA extracted from foetal tissue was analysed using array comparative genomic hybridization. No pathogenic genomic copy number variants were identified. Subsequently, a gene panel (including CAKUT genes BMP7, CDC5L, CHD1L, EYA1, FRAS1, FREM1, FREM2, GATA3, GREM1, GRIP1, HNF1B, ITGA8, PAX2, RET, ROBO2, SALL1, SIX2, SIX5 and TBX18) was targeted for sequencing to identify putative disease-associated variants using next-generation sequencing. Smaller indels, up to 50 bp, were called in the variant analysis pipeline, whereas exon deletion/duplications were analysed using a copy number variation tool. These analyses only identified a heterozygous PAX2 missense variant c.68T>C [p.(Leu23Pro)].
Subsequently, the PAX2 candidate variant was assessed for cosegregation with kidney phenotypes in the family under study. The variant was identified in all family members affected by kidney disease for which DNA was available (). The kidney phenotypes seen in the family were remarkably heterogeneous, including bilateral kidney agenesis, minimal change nephropathy, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, duplex kidney with hydronephrosis of upper pole system and bilateral kidney hypoplasia with end-stage renal failure in early adult life or with only moderate chronic kidney failure in late adult life.
To study whether the severe foetal phenotype was exacerbated by additional variants in modifier genes, an additional 138 genes previously associated with kidney disease were analysed, including GREB1L, FGF20 and LMX1B. No additional candidate variants were identified.

"A 7-year-old girl presented with a 1-week history of swelling in the right anterior neck and submandibular area. Her past history and family history were noncontributary. Her growth pattern and development were also normal. Inspection of the neck revealed swellings in the right upper and left submandibular areas with no distortion of the overlying skin (). Physical examination revealed a fixed, hard, mildly tender pretracheal mass, 1.5x2.0 cm in size and another fixed, hard submandibular mass, 0.5x0.5 cm in size. There was no enlargement of the cervical lymph nodes. The remaining findings of the physical examination were unremarkable.
The masses were evaluated using ultrasonography (USG) and computed tomography (CT). USG examination revealed well-defined masses with heterogeneous echogenicity and the thyroid gland was not in the expected cervical location. Neck CT revealed aberrant thyroid tissue as a 1.3x2.3 cm, round-shaped, high-density mass in the right pretracheal area and another 1.4x1.6 cm mass with the same characteristics in the region of the tongue base (). A 99m-technetium pertechnetate thyroid scintigraphy was performed, which demonstrated two ectopic areas of uptake (upper anterior neck and lingual areas), confirming dual thyroid ectopia (). There was no uptake in the normal anatomical location of the thyroid gland. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of dual ectopic thyroid was made. Biochemical determinations were consistent with a state of subclinical hypothyroidism. Serum triiodothyronine level was 1.7 ng/mL (normal, 0.9-2.4 ng/mL); free thyroxine (fT4), 17.2 pmol/L (normal, 10-28 pmol/L) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level was 9.49 mIU/L (normal, 0.7-6.4 mIU/L).
Following the diagnosis, the patient was treated conservatively with oral levothyroxine, 0.05 mg per day. After treatment, she remained asymptomatic, the masses slightly decreased in size and repeated thyroid function tests were found to be within the normal limits.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission. Exclusion Criteria: Individuals under 18 years of age, COVID-19 infection, Infection of the skin at the CGM site requiring removal of the sensor, Patients with altered Mental Status, Patients unable to scan their flash CGMs at least every 8 hours, Inability to provide written consent, Hospitalized for less than 24 hours.",0.5
"A 19-year-old female with no significant past medical history was referred to the emergency department from her antenatal clinic for further evaluation of fever 102 F, headache, malaise, nausea, and vomiting of 4-days duration following mild sore throat. She was in her 28th week of gestation on presentation. Physical examination showed an obese and anxious-appearing lady in mild respiratory distress with gravid abdomen. She weighed 142 kilograms (kg) with a BMI of 44.3. Her blood pressure was 111/60 mmHg, respiratory rate 24, heart rate 111, temperature 101.8 F, and oxygen saturation 96% on 2 liters (L) nasal cannula oxygen. She had dry mucous membranes, with no oral thrush or ulcers. Her abdomen was gravid with focal areas of tenderness, bowel sounds were heard, and fetal movement was detected. Pulmonary and cardiovascular examinations were unremarkable.
Her initial laboratory tests were significant for white blood cell (WBC) count of 11.8 K/uL with 78% neutrophil predominance and lymphopenia (0.77 K/uL). Although she had no urinary symptoms, urinalysis showed bacteriuria, confirmed as group B streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) with cultures. Initial chest X-ray and liver enzymes on admission were unremarkable. She was started on intravenous fluids for suspected gastroenteritis and oral cephalexin for asymptomatic GBS infection. Stool studies for clostridium difficile, comprehensive panel, ova, and parasites were ordered which all returned negative. However, she continued to spike fever through the third day of hospitalization prompting expansion of antibiotic coverage to Vancomycin and Zosyn (). Liver transaminases which had been normal began to spike. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 190, alanine aminotransferase (AST) was 135, and alkaline phosphatase was 110 while bilirubin remained normal. Serum Tylenol and hepatitis A, B, and C serologies were negative. Infectious Disease (ID) consultation was requested who recommended further infectious work-up with CMV, EBV, HIV, HSV, Rickettsia, and Leptospira serologies.
The patient continued to spike high grade fever reaching 103 F on day 4 of admission despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics and negative infectious work-up including the aforementioned serologies. She also developed bloody diarrhea and acute kidney injury (AKI) prompting evaluation for possible Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and autoimmune diseases which all returned negative as well. Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed normal liver and gallbladder morphologies. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed diffuse T2 hyperintensity throughout the liver compatible with acute liver injury but was negative for any focal intra-abdominal or pelvic abscess.
One week into her hospitalization, her AST and ALT kept trending up reaching a peak of 1712 U/L and 845 U/L, respectively (), mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase 140, INR 1.6, normal total bilirubin, absolute lymphocyte count of 0.11 K/uL, persistently negative blood cultures, and serum creatinine increased to 2.9 mg/dL, all concerning for a disseminated process. She became increasingly lethargic, tachycardic, and tachypneic necessitating care in the intensive care unit. With uprising liver enzymes and negative extensive infectious and rheumatologic work-up including Hep A, B, C serologies and PCR, EBV, CMV, Parvovirus, Rickettsia, and Leptospiral serologies, as well as negative HSV 1 and 2 IgM and IgG antibodies, antinuclear, and anti-liver-kidney microsomal antibodies, normal cryoglobulins, ceruloplasmin, alpha 1 antitrypsin and serum copper levels, and largely unremarkable imaging and stool studies, a decision was made to proceed with a liver biopsy. At this time, empiric acyclovir was started while other antibiotics were discontinued per ID recommendations.
Within the first 24 hours of starting acyclovir, AST and ALT began to downtrend while fever and diarrhea improved (). Despite negative HSV-2 serologies, the PCR was reported on hospital day-8 with a very high viral load >100 million DNA copies/ml following which she reported a remote history of cold sores but denied a history of genital ulcers. A diagnosis of HSV hepatitis was made and she was transitioned to Val-acyclovir 1 gram three times daily to complete 14 days of therapy, then to resume acyclovir 400 mg three times daily until delivery to prevent recurrence. On the 12th day of hospitalization, she was discharged home without needing a biopsy anymore and with complete resolution of symptoms and improvement of liver enzymes and AKI; AST 72, ALT 208, alkaline phosphatase 150, total bilirubin 0.5 and creatinine 0.5. She remained symptom-free with complete normalization of creatinine and liver enzymes at outpatient follow-up two weeks after discharge. She was eventually delivered of a healthy baby boy via cesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation with no peripartum complications.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 60-year-old man presented to the emergency department with chest pain lasting for 2 days. Electrocardiography revealed ST-segment elevation in leads V1–V4 as well as elevated levels of serum troponin T (5.68 ng/mL; normal range, <0.14 ng/mL) and a creatine kinase-myocardial band (33.73 U/L; normal range, <25 U/L), indicating AMI. Routine blood tests showed a mildly increased erythrocyte level (6.05 × 109/L; normal range, 3.5–9.5 × 109/L) and a significantly increased leukocyte level (20.56 × 109/L; normal range, 3.5–9.5 × 109/L) and platelet count (643 × 109/L; normal range, 100–300 × 109/L). However, his hemoglobin level was normal (171 g/L; normal range, 130–175 g/L) (). Emergency coronary angiography showed total obstruction of the middle of the left anterior descending coronary artery (). Therefore, leukocyte elevation was initially considered to be caused by stress after myocardial ischemia. After receiving 300 mg aspirin and 180 mg ticagrelor, a stent was successfully placed, and antiplatelet therapy with oral aspirin (100 mg per day) and ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily) was administered. He had no conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Twelve days later, the patient suddenly developed dizziness, diplopia, and visual distortion. Cerebral computed tomography (CT) revealed a hemorrhagic infarction in the right parieto-occipital lobe (). The craniocervical CT angiogram (CTA) was normal. Blood routine test indicated mildly increased levels of hematocrit (55.4%; normal range, 40–50%), leukocytes (12.12 × 109/L; normal range, 3.5–9.5 × 109/L), and hemoglobin (183 g/L; normal range, 130–175 g/L) and significantly increased platelet count (1,128 × 109/L; normal range, 100–300 × 109/L). A blood electrolyte test showed an elevated potassium concentration (5.9 mmol/L; normal range, 3.5–5.5 mmol/L), and intravenous calcium gluconate was used to reduce blood potassium. However, in the next few days, blood routine examinations showed significantly increased levels of erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and leukocyte and platelet count (). Thus, bone marrow biopsy was performed, which demonstrated the proliferation of all three cell lineages. Bone marrow aspirate smears revealed active hyperplasia of bone marrow, and the ratio of G/E (granulocytes to erythrocytes) was 1.65. The proportion of granulocyte was increased, accounting for 56%, and granulocytes account for 34%. There were > 200 megakaryocytes. There were no common risk factors of atherosclerotic vascular diseases for the patient, including smoking, hypertension, diabetes, hyperuricemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation, etc.
Since hematocrit and hemoglobin levels were significantly increased and bone marrow biopsy showed proliferation of all three lineage cells, PV was strongly suspected. Gene testing confirmed a positive JAK2 mutation. The patient refused venous exsanguination. Patients with thrombosis aged >60 years should be treated with either hydroxyurea or interferon for descending cell therapy. He was then treated with hydroxyurea (500 mg) twice daily and interferon (30 μg) once daily. Since the patient was still required to take antiplatelet drugs to prevent thrombosis and myocardial and cerebral infarctions, the patient was only administered ticagrelor every 12 h. After 3 months of treatment, his blood routine returned to normal.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 36-year-old gravida 5 para 3013 was referred to our fetal treatment centre at 24 weeks of gestation with a fetal diagnosis of congenital high airway obstruction syndrome (CHAOS) without additional anomalies (). Fetal imaging revealed a gap in the trachea, but sufficient tracheal length was present to permit access for tracheostomy. Fetal cytogenetics from an amniotic fluid sample revealed a normal karyotype and microarray. In a multidisciplinary conference involving the family, options were discussed to include termination of pregnancy, delivery with neonatal comfort care and an EXIT-to-airway procedure. The family was well informed that without an established airway at the time of delivery, a neonatal demise would be imminent. Fetoscopic laser decompression of CHAOS, feasible in select cases, was not considered in this scenario secondary to the long gap defect noted on fetal imaging, which would result in a low likelihood of a successful procedure, as well as the associated risks of surrounding tissue injury. Prematurity is also higher following fetoscopic procedures, and an EXIT procedure remains necessary regardless of decompression to develop an adequate airway at delivery. The family elected for a re-evaluation in the third trimester and returned at 31 weeks of gestational age for a repeat ultrasound and fetal MRI. She received weekly ultrasounds at the referring centre to determine fetal viability, monitor amniotic fluid volume and assess for signs of premature labour until she relocated to our centre. Findings on follow-up remained stable when compared with her earlier evaluation, with the exception of asymptomatic polyhydramnios.
After follow-up counselling, the family elected to undergo an EXIT-to-airway procedure scheduled for 37 weeks of gestation. At this point, a call tree was established placing all key specialties on 24-hour availability until the procedure was completed. The gestational age chosen for the procedure was established to allow for further fetal growth and to promote fetal lung maturity.
At 34 weeks 5 days of gestation, she presented to labour and delivery at 03:00 on a Sunday morning with the complaint of gross rupture of membranes. On examination, her cervix was noted to be 4 cm dilated; there was gross pooling of amniotic fluid; and the umbilical cord was prolapsed through the cervix up to the level of the introitus (). The fetus was in the breech presentation. Contractions were occurring regularly at 4 min intervals with persistent variable fetal heart rate decelerations down to 80 beats/min. The call tree was activated. The patient was taken to the operating room and underwent general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation, while the multidisciplinary team congregated to discuss adjustments to the procedure. The time from patient presentation in labour and delivery triage to induction of general anaesthesia was 59 min, with all essential team members present.
The decision was made to make a maternal midline laparotomy to provide sufficient access to completely exteriorise the late-preterm gravid uterus and to make a fundal hysterotomy to deliver the fetal head and neck first. The placenta was anterior, and the fetus was in the breech presentation in the setting of anhydramnios secondary to rupture of membranes. An attempt at external cephalic version was not deemed safe in the setting of anhydramnios, active labour and existing cord prolapse. For these reasons, the original plan to perform a maternal abdominal transverse skin incision with a low transverse uterine hysterotomy was therefore abandoned. The midline skin incision was made to just below the umbilicus with placement of a large Olexis O retractor (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, Californis, USA) allowing the uterus to be exteriorised. The anaesthesiologist provided maximal halogenated agents with a mean alveolar concentration of 3, along with both nitroglycerin and terbutaline. Unfortunately, uterine relaxation was not sufficient to maintain optimal placental perfusion to the fetus. In an effort to expedite the procedure, the surgical team proceeded by placing a haemostatic myometrial box stitch at the fundus placed well away from the placental edge. The uterus was incised within the box stitch with electrocautery, and the amniotic sac was entered. Bainbridge clamps were used to compress the myometrium prior to placing uterine haemostatic staplers. Due to inadequate uterine relaxation, the thickened myometrium prohibited sufficient compression of tissue to allow for stapling. At this point, the uterine entry point was extended with electrocautery, and Allis clamps were used along the length of the hysterotomy to provide haemostasis. The fetal head and neck were then delivered followed immediately by an intramuscular injection of a cocktail containing atropine, rocuronium and fentanyl. A rapid intravenous infusion device was used to infuse warm lactated Ringer’s solution through the hysterotomy to assist in maintaining uterine volume. Fetal monitoring performed throughout the procedure by fetal cardiology demonstrated intermittent bradycardia with rate as low as 88 beats/min and as high as 129 beats/min with depressed biventricular function. At this time, the paediatric surgeon and paediatric otolaryngologist worked in concert and established an airway via an endotracheal tube through a tracheostomy incision. The time from delivery of the head and neck until airway establishment was 3 min. The remainder of the baby was delivered; the umbilical cord was clamped and cut; and the infant was passed off to the neonatology team.
The neonatal response to initial resuscitation was an immediate return to a heart rate in the 150’s bpm with an oxygen saturation of 100%. After stabilisation, bronchoscopy revealed laryngeal atresia below the level of the vocal cords with an intact trachea ().
The parturient was extubated after the placement of bilateral transversus abdominus plane blocks for postoperative pain control. Unfortunately, during the first 24 hours postpartum, the mother developed uterine atony necessitating the use of uterotonics and uterine balloon tamponade. She received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells. Subsequently, the mother remained inpatient for three postoperative days and was discharged in good condition without further complications from the surgical procedure.
The infant is doing well and remains with a tracheostomy awaiting definitive repair of the laryngeal atresia.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 62-year-old male with past medical history of type 2 DM (DM-2) and hypertension of 20 years presented to our emergency room with progressive dyspnea that had worsened gradually over the last three months. He was being treated in another facility with questionable diagnosis of congestive heart failure with incomplete response to diuretic therapy. There was no history of chest pain, cough, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He was a nonsmoker and had used alcohol occasionally. There was no recent viral or flu-like illness. On careful questioning, he complained of difficulty in walking and weakness in his legs. The patient denied any back pain, fever, weight loss, bladder involvement, or pain and paresthesias in his extremities. Neurological examination revealed bilateral symmetric muscle weakness with power of 4/5 in upper proximal and distal extremities and 3/5 in lower proximal and distal extremities. There was no ptosis or gaze paresis. Cranial nerves I–XII were grossly intact. There was no evidence of atrophy of the hand muscles and fasciculations. Sensory exam revealed decreased pinprick sensation distal part of extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were graded one in both upper and lower extremities. His blood pressure on admission was 161/106 mm Hg. A fasting blood glucose done at emergency room triage was 229 mg/dL. The clinical and functional examinations did not correlate with the severity of dyspnea. Arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed respiratory insufficiency (pO2 of 60 mm Hg, pCO2 of 58 mm Hg, and SaO2 of 89%).
Initially, chest radiograph was obtained which revealed normal lung fields with no evidence of fluid overload. Serum electrolytes and thyroid panel were found to be normal. β-natriuretic peptide level and 2-D echocardiogram results were inconsistent with heart failure. Adequate glycemic control was achieved with insulin, and serial ABGs remained unchanged on day 1. As the diagnosis leaned towards neuromuscular involvement, bilevel positive alveolar pressure (BiPAP) was started which was followed by serial vital capacities and negative inspiratory pressure (NIP). CSF analysis narrowed the differential to demyelinating neuropathy, which proved to be inconsistent with Gullian-Barré syndrome. EMG analysis revealed sensorimotor polyneuropathy that was predominantly axonal and demyelinating in nature (). In the meantime, the patient's vital capacity dropped to 0.7 liters with NIP of −26 cm H2O. Anti-paraneoplastic antibody screening with ANA and anti-MAG levels were noncontributory. On day 4, the CSF culture was negative. As diabetic polyradiculopathy was considered the most likely diagnosis, intravenous immunoglobulin IVIg 0.4 g/kg/day was started for five days. The patient tolerated the treatment well and showed both subjective and objective improvement as assessed by serial ABGs, vital capacity, and NIP assessment (). The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center in stable respiratory condition with intermittent nasal oxygen insufflation and overnight BiPAP ventilation.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A female patient aged 60 years (with skin type III according to Fitzpatrick), with moderate chronic plaque psoriasis (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] =7.7), came to the dermatological clinic to receive phototherapy. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee at the University of Gothenburg and the National Data Inspection Board (approval number DNR:089–12, T285-16). The patient´s written informed consent was obtained for case details and publishing accompanying images. The patient was treated with NBUVB therapy (311 nm, according to standard protocol, 28 sessions, total dose 3.0 J/cm2 (increasing from 0.3 to 3.0 J/cm2) and psoriasis significantly improved (PASI =0.6). Four 4 mm punch biopsies were taken, one from intralesional psoriatic skin and one from perilesional healthy skin (about 2 cm from the psoriasis plaque) before and 24 hours after the last NBUVB session (). The biopsies were wrapped in aluminum foil and frozen at −70°C. Each sample was sectioned into 10 μm thin slices and placed on conductive glass slides. The whole process is illustrated in . The sections on the slides were used as they were for NLM and ToF-SIMS measurements; no treatment was done before the measurements.

"A 40-year-old male was admitted to hospital because of chest discomfort and dyspnea. The patient had been well until 2 weeks before admission, when chest pain, cough, and dyspnea had developed. Two days before admission, he could not lie down because of dyspnea. He went to another hospital and a chest X-ray (CXR) was performed. A CXR revealed a widened mediastinum and he was referred to the emergency department of our hospital.
On examination, he appeared dyspneic and presented with orthopnea. His vital signs were normal. He had no peripheral lymphadenopathy. Laboratory tests on admission showed elevated lactate dehydrogenase level of 744 IU/L. The result of arterial blood gas was normal (). A CXR revealed a widened mediastinum and left pleural effusion () and contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed a mediastinal mass of 12 cm by 7 cm, compressing the trachea (). A CT revealed no lymphadenopathy other than the mediastinal lesion.
On hospital day 2, tracheal intubation was performed by an anesthesiologist as the patient was considered to have high risk of suffocation. During the tracheal intubation, the left main bronchus was obstructed completely by a mediastinal tumor and the patient suddenly developed hypoxia. Oxygen was administered through a tracheal tube but the oxygen saturation was approximately 80 percent. ECMO was introduced immediately to recover oxygenation, placing a venous cannula in the right common femoral vein and an arterial cannula in the jugular vein. A CXR after intubation revealed atelectasis of the left lung (). After introducing ECMO, oxygen saturation was maintained at about 98 percent and PaO2 was 96 mmHg (). Percutaneous fine needle biopsy of the mediastinal tumor was performed and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. A provisional pathological diagnosis was LBL. On hospital day 3, chemotherapy, comprised of adriamycin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisolone (CHOP), was started to debulk the mediastinal lesion.
After chemotherapy was started, the mediastinal mass shrank rapidly and oxygenation gradually improved. He was weaned from ECMO on hospital day 8 and weaned from the mechanical ventilation and was extubated on hospital day 28. He did not have any respiratory sequelae after extubation. The final pathological diagnosis was T-LBL. Chromosomal analysis did not reveal any abnormalities and an FISH of the BCR-ABL was negative. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 202 protocol without imatinib (Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group) [] was started on hospital day 23 followed by subsequent consolidation chemotherapy. A CXR performed on day 71 shows disappearance of atelectasis and shrinkage of the mediastinal tumor (). A contrast enhanced CT of the chest performed on hospital day 87 confirmed partial remission of the tumor (). The patient's sister was confirmed as having full-matching HLA and the patient was referred to another hospital to receive allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation.
Adverse reactions during clinical courses were febrile neutropenia, acute kidney injury, which did not require renal replacement therapy, and right femoral subcutaneous abscess caused by cannulation for ECMO. He did not develop bleeding or thromboembolism as complications of ECMO.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 35 years-old male with left distal radius and ulna fracture was scheduled for closed reduction and percutaneous pinning. His Physical examination was normal. The patient did not have any past surgeries and didn’t take any medication. The patient was somewhat anxious about having surgery under general anesthesia and requested the regional anesthesia. Standard monitoring including non-invasive blood pressure recording, pulse oximetery and electrocardiography were applied and a single injection ultrasound guided infraclavicular block was implemented for the procedure. Midazolam 2 mg was given intravenously 10 minutes before the start of the block, and IV fentanyl (75 micg) before insertion of the needle was administered. We used a Honda HS – 2100 System and a 7.5-10 MHz linear ultrasound probe. The patient assumed a supine position and turned his head to the opposite side.
With the probe placed in a parasagital plane medial and inferior to the coracoids process, we obtained a clear short-axis image of the axillary artery. The entry point of the needle was anesthetized with lidocaine (3 mL, 1%). Then, using an in-plane approach, a 22 gauge, 100-mm short bevel insulated needle (pajunk, UniPlex NanoLine) was advanced and placed posterior to the axillary artery, next to the posterior cord. After reassuring that the needle tip is in correct location, and confirming a negative aspiration for blood, we slowly injected bupivacaine (30 mL, 0.25%) and dexamethasone (8 mg), and then withdrew the needle. During the injection no adverse effect was noticed. Five minutes after the injection muscle coordination in the extremity was lost and the pain diminished substantially. These were indicative of an impending successful block. After 15 minutes the surgery was allowed to start. The surgical procedure (closed reduction and percutaneous pinning) lasted 40 minutes. After the end of surgery, the patient was monitored for half an hour in the PACU and then transferred to ward.
The next morning, we were informed that the patient had not recovered completely from the motor and sensory blockade. Examination of the patient proved the same. The patient’s condition was reassessed once more 24 hours after the performance of the block. No significant change in the patient’s condition was found; complete motor and sensory blockade was persistent. Despite that the patient had no complaint about pain or paresthesia during injection of the local anesthetic and that we did not notice any unusual resistance to injection, a complete motor and sensory block in C6, C7, and C8 had remained, and the possibility of damage to nerves emerged. A nerve conduction study was requested and until then a trained nurse from acute pain service was put in charge of evaluating the patient every hour. It was approximately thirty hours after the original injection that the nurse reported the patient had felt occasional stabbing pain in his fingers. Expecting that recovery would gradually come about, the nerve conduction study was postponed to a later time in the next morning. Complete recovery of motor and sensory functions required 42 hours. Second examination of the brachial plexus 24 hours later did not reveal any residual motor or sensory blockade.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 29-year-old Japanese woman was admitted with lowered consciousness and a high fever (>39°C), arthralgia, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy that had persisted for a week. She had a history of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and macrophage activation syndrome when she was 9 years old and was treated with oral prednisolone until she was 15 years old. Brain MRI showed bilateral swelling and high signal intensity in the basal ganglia and thalamus according to T2-weighted images and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (shown in Fig. , b). Blood examinations revealed the following: leukocyte count, 5,100/μL (88% neutrophils); hemoglobin, 14.3 g/dL; platelets, 110,000/μL; C-reactive protein, 5.36 mg/dL; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 29 mm/h; slightly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, 84 U/L, and alanine aminotransferase, 16 U/L), elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor, 1,261 U/mL, and an elevated serum ferritin level of 4,088 ng/mL (reference range, 5–152 ng/mL). The kidney function test results were within normal limits, the antinuclear antigen was at the borderline level, and the rheumatoid factor and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody tests were negative. Her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on admission showed an opening pressure of 7 cm H2O, 7 cells/mm3 (71% lymphocytes), increased protein levels (265 mg/dL; normal, <40 mg/dL), and a slightly low glucose level (48 mg/dL; normal, >50 mg/dL). Blood, urine, and CSF cultures were negative. Viral meningitis (human herpesvirus 1–6) was excluded using CSF in a polymerase chain reaction assay. An extensive infectious disease evaluation was negative. Her consciousness disorder improved without treatment, and her brain MRI also showed an improvement 3 weeks after admission (shown in Fig. , d). Nevertheless, a high fever, arthritis, and salmon-colored rash on her trunk and limbs persisted (shown in Fig. ). Abdominal CT revealed splenomegaly.
After excluding infections, malignancies, and other rheumatic diseases, ASD was diagnosed based on the presence of fever, arthritis, rash, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and hepatic dysfunction, according to the Yamaguchi criteria []. Her schistocytosis and worsening of anemia (hemoglobin, 8.7 g/dL) became clinically evident, and oral prednisolone of 45 mg (1 mg/day/kg) was administered. TMA was ruled out because of her normal platelet count (162,000/μL), normal kidney function (creatinine, 0.60), and normalized fever without any neurological signs. After administering oral prednisone for 2 days, the patient presented with blurred vision in the left eye and was referred to the ophthalmology department. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/17 in each eye, and her intraocular pressure was normal at the initial visit. A slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment of the eye was unremarkable. A funduscopic examination revealed bilateral cotton-wool spots, Purtscher flecken, and a small number of intraretinal hemorrhages around the optic nerve and in the posterior pole (shown in Fig. ), which were compatible with Purtscher-like retinopathy []. Optical coherence tomography showed inner retinal thickening consistent with cotton-wool spots in both eyes (shown in Fig. ). Fundus fluorescein angiography showed hypofluorescence in the early phase and increased permeability in the late phase, consistent with the lesions (shown in Fig. ). There was no apparent nonperfusion area in either eye.
Despite treatment with high-dose oral prednisolone for 2 weeks, her laboratory data gradually worsened, showing elevated serum ferritin levels (5,663 ng/mL) and developed macrophage activation syndrome []. Therefore, intravenous pulse methylprednisolone therapy was initiated at 1,000 mg/day for 5 days, followed by oral prednisolone of 90 mg (2 mg/kg/day). Nine days after the administration of intravenous pulse methylprednisolone therapy, the patient's serum ferritin levels dropped to 462 ng/mL, and aspartate aminotransferase levels and the platelet count fell within normal limits. TCZ (8 mg/kg every week during hospitalization and 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks after discharge) was administered considering the severity of ASD (shown in Fig. ). The patient visited the ophthalmology department again 15 days after the administration of intravenous pulse methylprednisolone therapy, and her funduscopic examination revealed reduced bilateral cotton-wool spots and Purtscher flecken (shown in Fig. ). Her ASD was successfully treated, and the oral prednisolone treatment was tapered. Although her Purtscher-like retinopathy improved as her ASD activity decreased, nerve fiber layer defect (NFLD) in both eyes appeared 7 months after initial visit (shown in Fig. ). Humphrey visual field testing showed visual field defect corresponding to NFLD (shown in Fig. ). At her last visit, that was 1 year after the administration of intravenous pulse methylprednisolone therapy, the patient was taking prednisolone (5 mg/day) and continuing TCZ, and she remained in good health without a major ASD flare.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"An 86-year-old male was referred to Saitama Medical University Hospital (Moroyama, Saitama, Japan) from a local dentist in July 2015 due to the presence of an intraoral mass. The patient had not noticed the mass until the dentist brought it to his attention. His previous history included transitional cell cancer of the bladder, but his family history was unremarkable. The round mass, measuring 12 mm in diameter, was located in the left buccal mucosa (). The mass was soft, nontender, and nonadherent to the surrounding tissue, and the surface exhibited normal mucosa. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left buccal region showed a mass with intensity lower than that of skeletal muscle tissue on T1-weighted imaging () and with intensity higher than that of adipose tissue on T2-weighted imaging (). This was diagnosed as a benign buccal tumor and was subsequently resected under local anesthesia. The tumor was easily dissected from the surrounding tissue and appeared to be covered with a thin fibrotic capsule. The resected specimen measured 2 cm at its largest diameter () and was filled with glossy, mucoid, and milky white materials (). Microscopically, the tumor cells in the sparse mucoid matrix () exhibited a spindle or stellate shape without nuclear atypia (data not shown). The tumor matrix had abundant collagen fibers and was strongly stained with alcian blue, indicating the presence of acidic polysaccharides (data not shown). On immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells were negative for S-100 protein, ASMA, and CD3 (data not shown). The final histopathological diagnosis was a myxoma. The tumor was completely resected, and five years later, the patient exhibited no recurrence or distant metastasis.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 3-year-old girl was admitted for fever and cough. She was diagnosed as having pleuresia and pleural drainage along with broad spectrum antibiotics was prescribed. Lack of improvement after a few days led to complete the work-up with a CT scan (Fig. a, b). The scan showed a tissular lesion of the left lower pulmonary lobe associated with a tumor of the right kidney. Lung biopsy showed blastema, without being able to distinguish whether its origin was WT or PPB despite multiple analyses by various pathological experts. Following the recommendations of the national panel of expert of both tumors, we decided to treat the patient as a metastatic WT following the International Society of Paediatric Oncology protocol (SIOP WT2001) []. A nephrectomy was thus performed after 6 weeks of chemotherapy (vincristine and actinomycin), with a good response in both sites (Fig. ).
Histologic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of WT with an intermediate risk (epithelial type) which was classified as a stage IV. Lung surgery was scheduled several weeks later. During this period, using high-throughput sequencing of a panel of genes involved in endocrine tumor development, we identified a heterozygous pathogenic variant in exon 23 of the DICER1 gene (LRG_492). This variant c.4407_4410del, p.Ser1470Leufs*19, leading to loss of the RNase III active site, has been previously associated with pleuropulmonary blastoma [].The mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Fig. ). This led to a high suspicion of associated PPB. Pre-operative workup showed increase in tumor size, and chemotherapy was modified (by adding ifosfamide and doxorubicin) to try to reduce tumor volume and vascularization. After the first course of chemotherapy, the patient developed respiratory distress due to a massive increase in tumor size, leading to mediastinal compression. It was then decided to remove the left lung (Fig. e, f).
A left pleuro-pneumonectomy with intra-pericardic ligature of the vessels and without cardiac assistance was performed. The early postoperative course was uneventful. The pathologist confirmed the diagnosis of type 3 PPB with R0 resection. Postoperative chemotherapy consisted of eight courses (27 weeks) of vincristine, actinomycin, and doxorubicin. After 1-year follow-up, the patient remains asymptomatic and is considered to be in remission.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 49-year-old male presented with a history of bomb blast injury to his left elbow 25 years back, when he had sustained an open and comminuted fracture of left distal humerus with extension into the elbow joint. The injury was treated with wound debridement and cast application for 6 weeks. Distal humerus progressed to atrophic non-union, with severe deformity and stiffness of the elbow. He also had partial involvement of radial and ulnar nerves with stiffness and deformities of the fingers of the left hand. He presented to us for correction of the elbow deformity and to gain reasonable elbow and hand function.
On local examination, there were multiple scars present medially, laterally and posteriorly around his left elbow suggestive of healed wounds by secondary intention after compound injury. There was fixed flexion deformity of the elbow of 900 with further flexion up to 120 degree was possible (, ). There was partial sensory loss in the little and ring fingers and the muscle power (as per MRC grading) of the finger flexors was 3/5; wrist and those of elbow flexors was 2/5. The motor power of left fingers, wrist and elbow extensors were 1/5.
Plain radiographs revealed atrophic non-union of the supracondylar fracture along with the deformity at the distal humerus due to malunited distal humeral fracture (, ). CT scan confirmed these radiographic findings and demonstrated a significant gap at the fracture site with grossly rotated distal humeral condylar fragments and marked disuse osteopenia.
In view of grossly distorted anatomy of the distal humerus, poor bone stock, bone gap at the non-united fracture, severe elbow deformity and stiffness we preferred to go for a mega prosthetic replacement of the left elbow. Under general anaesthesia, elbow was approached posteriorly by ’Wadsworth approach’ and the fracture site was exposed. Severe fibrosis was encountered between the fractured ends of the bone, which was excised. The distal humeral condylar fragments were found to be grossly mal-positioned, osteoporosed, destructed and were not amenable to osteosynthesis or conventional total elbow replacement. Hence, the distal humeral bone fragments were excised, leading to a large bone gap at the elbow. This gap was reconstructed by using elbow mega prosthesis. Preparation for mega prosthetic replacement was done by reaming the humeral and ulnar shafts. Cemented titanium prosthesis (XLO Tm) was used for reconstruction, with ulnar stem of 132 mm and humeral stem of 175 mm length. The implant had eyes in the ulnar component for the attachment of the triceps tendon. Common flexor tendons were attached on the medial side and the common extensor tendons were attached on lateral side of triceps tendon and finally the combined tendinous complex was attached at the eye of the prosthesis with the help of non-absorbable polyester suture (Ethibond™ No. 5). Intra operatively, we could achieve good correction of the elbow deformity (with ROM of 10-1500) with stable elbow joint.
The patient was given i.v. third generation cephalosporin and aminoglycoside for a period of three days post operatively. The antibiotics were shifted to oral at the time of discharge and were continued for a period of two weeks till suture removal. The limb was kept in a splint for 2 weeks followed by physical therapy to regain the movements and function of the elbow and hand (, ). The post-operative recovery was satisfactory and uneventful. Post-operative X-ray showed good placement of the prosthesis with adequate cementation (, ).
At 12 months follow up, the the patient had significant improvement in the post-operative Mayo elbow score of 80 compared to pre-operative score of only 50. The patient could now do many of his activities of daily living with left hand, which were not possible before, apart from significant improvement in the cosmetic appearance.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 49-year-old woman hospitalized at the Department of Plastic and Maxillofacial Surgery, presented with a growing mass in her left maxillary hard palate dating 2 months back. She was diagnosed with an oral ulcer at a local clinic, and received antibiotics. However, the symptoms did not improve; the mass became bigger and painful. Her past medical history was unremarkable without any systemic disease. No obvious physical findings were noted during general examination. She had no bouts of fever, chills, night sweats, vomiting, or weight loss. The intraoral examination revealed that there was a mass measuring 3.0 cm × 2.0 cm in size, with ulcerated surface mucosa in the left maxillary hard palate (Fig. ).
To obtain a definitive diagnosis, an incisional biopsy of the oral mass was performed under local anesthesia. Histologic examination using hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed that there was diffuse cell infiltration growth. Most cells were large, with vacuolated nuclei, obvious nucleoli and a basophilic cytoplasm containing granules (Fig. ). For the final diagnosis, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed, and the tumor cells tested positive for MPO, CD4, BCL-2, KI-67 (Fig. ), and CD117 and negative for CD3, CD5, CD20, CD56, bcl-6, Mum-1, CD123, MUM-1, TdT, Syn, SOX11, and C-myc. These results supported the diagnosis of GS.
The patient was then referred to the Hematology Department. Bone marrow aspiration was negative for malignant cells, and the laboratory test results revealed only monocytosis. Standard bone marrow cytogenetic analysis showed a normal karyotype and leukemia-related fusion gene detection was normal. Therefore, according to IHC and bone marrow aspiration results in combination with morphological features, the final diagnosis was intraoral primary GS.
A chemotherapy regimen comprising idarubicin 8 mg VD d1–3 and cytarabine arabinoside 150 mg VD d1–7 idarubicin and cytarabine arabinoside was initiated. During chemotherapy, the patient only appeared mild nausea, vomiting and canker sores (grade II). These symptoms gradually eased without special therapy. After 2 cycles of idarubicin and cytarabine arabinoside regimen chemotherapy, the patient achieved complete remission. The tumor was barely visible in the left maxillary hard palate (Fig. ). The patient denied consolidation therapy or bone marrow transplant. Nevertheless, there has been no evidence of disease spread and progression after 1 year of follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"The patient, a 26-year-old male, with a history of acid injury in the right eye 3 months prior had been variously treated with symblepharon release, hAM transplantation, and BCL insertion in the acute phase followed by lid reconstruction, symblepharon release, and an Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) for uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP). At presentation, he had a total LSCD with total conjunctivalization of the cornea []. There were symblephara of the upper and lower lids [Fig. and ]. Vision was perception of light with inaccurate projection of rays. Digital tension was higher than normal. The left, unaffected eye was within normal limits with a healthy limbus. B-scan ultrasound of the affected eye revealed an attached retina. The technique of SLET used was as described by Sangwan et al.[] – blunt dissection of the pannus from the corneal surface, release of all symblephara, gluing of an hAM (non-cryopreserved, fresh), and fixation of limbal explants from the contralateral eye with fibrin glue (Tisseel Kit from Baxter AG, Vienna, Austria). At the end of the procedure, a BCL was placed. Tissue harvested from the healthy eye was approximately 2 mm wide and was divided into 11 bits which were placed in two concentric circles on the right eye []. shows the slitlamp photograph of the operated eye on post-operative day 2.
The patient was followed up daily for the first 6 days and subsequently on days 8, 10, and 14. At each visit, besides a full clinical evaluation, slit lamp photographs were taken and anterior segment OCT was done on a Cirrus™ HD-OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Goeschwitzer Strasse 51–52, 07745 Jena, Germany), spectral-domain OCT with an axial resolution of 5 μm and a transverse resolution of 15 μm.
For the purpose of the study, three explants were identified on a clinical photograph [] and labelled as 1, 2, and 3. Serial OCT was done along a radial axis for each explant reaching up to the limbus, as shown in by a single investigator (MS) at each follow up day on each of the three explants. Quality of all OCT images achieved was satisfactory. The best images were obtained for explant 2 and are reproduced here.
Postoperative regime followed was prednisolone acetate drops 6 times a day, moxifloxacin drops 6 times a day, and carboxy-methyl cellulose drops 2 hourly. The BCL was retained in the operated eye for the entire duration of the study.
There was rapid resolution of conjunctival congestion and good mobility of the globe with release of the symblephara. Lid closure was good. Digital IOP was normal. Anterior chamber details could be made out hazily through the translucent cornea, with the pannus removed. Vision remained perception of light with inaccurate projection of rays. The donor fellow eye had rapid closure of the epithelial defect at the donor site.
The hAM remained of even density (OCT reflectivity) and thickness throughout the study duration []. Sub-hAM space increased from day 3 and resolved completely by day 10. There was thinning of the explants from day 3 which corresponded to the sub-hAM space expansion, which may have been compressing the explants against the BCL. Fibrin around the explants started decreasing from day 2 onwards and disappeared by day 4. The hAm, even though glued to the corneal surface with fibrin glue, was not absolutely stable in the early days after SLET. The fibrin glue beneath the hAM appeared to swell, displacing the hAM anteriorly. However, this settled by day 10, and thereafter the hAM was adherent to the cornea. There were no changes in the consistency (reflectivity) and thickness of the hAM. The fibrin around the explants developed optically hollow spaces immediately adjacent the explants and started decreasing from day 2 and disappeared by day 4. Comment regarding the thinning rate of the explants is difficult as it is impossible to ensure that the OCT section is being taken at exactly the same site of the explants on each occasion. Further, the thinning of the explants appear to correlate with the initial bulging of the sub-hAM space and continued even as the hAM settled down and adhered to the cornea. There was no evidence of epithelialization up to day 8. By day 14, there was complete epithelialization on the limbal side, in contrast centripetally directed epithelialization was poor extending only about 0.24 mm on day 14. The nature of the epithelium was boggy and not the crisp reflective layer that is seen in OCT of normal corneas. There was little change in the corneal stromal thickness and lucidity on OCT.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 45-year-old male patient underwent partial penectomy and distal urethrostomy for erythroplasia of Queyrat (i.e. carcinoma in situ of squamous cell carcinoma) in 2008. Since he was extremely dissatisfied with the remaining penile stump, he consulted our center about the option of phallic reconstruction. On June 14, 2010, phallic reconstruction was performed. The native urethra was lengthened by means of a radial forearm free flap. The phallus was reconstructed with an anterolateral thigh flap. The urethra was positioned inside the phallus according to the ‘tube-in-a-tube’ principle. In October 2012, the patient presented with obstructive voiding symptoms. A diagnostic urethroscopy showed a suspicious lesion in the remaining native, bulbar urethra, and biopsy confirmed the recurrence of a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the urethra. On December 13, 2012, he underwent excision of the remaining native, bulbar urethra with the creation of a perineal urethrostomy at the membranous urethra. The perineal urethrostomy was performed using the technique as described by Blandy et al. []. Unfortunately, the postoperative period was complicated by bleeding, wound dehiscence and infection (fig. ). Finally, the perineal urethrostomy became completely obliterated and a suprapubic catheter was placed (fig. ). As the patient accepted this only as a temporary solution, we proposed the revision of the perineal urethrostomy using a meshed split-thickness skin graft. This procedure was performed on April 23, 2013. The patient was placed in the lithotomy position and a midline perineal incision was made. Dissection was continued up to the level of the urogenital diaphragm. A flexible cystoscope was inserted along the suprapubic tract and brought through the bladder neck into the posterior urethra. This marked the place of obliteration as the light of the cystoscope could be seen through the perineal incision. The urethra was opened on the tip of the cystoscope. All fibrotic tissue was further excised until only healthy urethral mucosa remained. The urethral stump was spatulated over 1.5 cm. Vicryl 4.0 stay sutures were placed at the mucosa to facilitate identification and to prepare the anastomosis for the graft (fig. ). A split-thickness graft (10 × 15 cm) was harvested from the skin of the left thigh and meshed 1:1. In the middle of the graft, an opening was made to anastomose with the urethral opening. The edges of the graft were further tailored and anastomosed with the perineal skin edges. Several additional quilting sutures were placed to fix the graft against the perineal graft bed (fig. ). A compressive dressing and a 20-Fr urethral catheter were left in place for 5 days. After 5 days, the dressing was removed with satisfactory graft take. Subsequently, the catheter was also removed. At present (6 months of follow-up), the patient is voiding well. Maximum and average urinary flow are 22 and 13 ml/s, respectively. His International Prostate Symptom score is 5/35. The perineal wound has healed well, with minimal contraction of the grafted area (fig. ). Through the neomeatus, a 20-Fr catheter can be passed without any difficulties, indicating a sufficient diameter.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"We report the case of a 25-year-old male, right handed, who suffered from a fracture-dislocation of the left radial head (Mason IV) after a motorcycle incident (). The patient underwent acute surgery for one attempt of open reduction and internal fixation. It resulted impossible for the comminution of the fracture and the surgeons proceeded to resection of the radial head followed by the implant of a press-fit radial head prosthesis (MoPyC, Tornier SAS Etablissement Bioprofile, Grenoble, France), through a postero-lateral access using the Kocher muscular interval. An insufficient intra-operatively stability requested a reinsertion of collateral lateral ligament performed by a Mytec anchor 2.0. The ligament reinsertion and the implant was initially protected and stabilized with an articulated external fixator, maintained for 40 days after surgery (). The intra-operatively evaluation of flex-extension was complete (0–140°). The patient was dismissed without any major complications.
One year after surgery, the patient underwent a clinical, functional and radiological evaluation, under the control of clinicians not involved in the surgery. The patient was also asked to answer the following questionnaires: VAS (visual analogic scale), DASH (disability of the arm, shoulder and hand), MEPS (Mayo elbow performance score) and the Oxford elbow score.
The ROM showed a flexion of the elbow of 140° with a lag extension of 25°, reducible to 20° passively and a complete prono-supination. The elbow was stable on both studied plane. An area of paresthesia was evidenced on the ulnar nerve territory, and the strength showed physiological values. The average results of the scores were the following: VAS 3, DASH 12.5, MEPS 85 and an Oxford Elbow score of 34.
The same patient, at a distance of about 2.5 years from the first traumatic episode, came again to our attention with pain in the left elbow, which appeared after a movement of prono-supination in extension. A rupture of the prosthetic stem was shown on the radiographs (). The patient underwent, as a result, a new surgical procedure. During surgery, after the prosthetic removal, stability tests were performed under anesthesia showing an acceptable stability of the elbow. Based on this evaluation, it was decided not to implant a new radial head prosthesis (). The patient was dismissed without any further complication.
Twenty-seven months after the second surgery, the patient was evaluated investigating all the same parameters listed above. ROM, sensibility and strength showed values similar to those of the previous evaluation (); the paresthesias on the ulnar nerve territory persisted. The varus and valgus stability, evaluated with the elbow in extension, and in 30° and 70° of flexion, appeared similar to the opposite elbow. The new scores showed average results of: VAS 1, DASH 4.2, MEPS 100 e Oxford Elbow Score 46. The scores showed better results than the previous one, and the patient reported a subjective improvement, compared to the time spent with the prosthesis.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 16 days old newborn female from Saudi Arabia was presented to the clinic with a skin defect localized on the scalp since birth. The baby did not suffer from any ailments, and her medical history was unremarkable. Her mother, 32 years old, denied any history of illnesses during her pregnancy, infection or drug intake taking including Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID) or methimazole. She completed 38 weeks of gestation, and delivered her baby via a normal vaginal delivery.
The newborn did not sustain any birth injury and did not suffer from any other abnormalities or feeding difficulties. She did not require any intensive care, and went home from hospital with her mother. Upon local examination, the defect was solitary, localized with an irregular shape and approximately 6×6 cm in size (). The lesion involved the epidermis and the upper dermis only. Neurosurgical team was involved in the care of this patient. A CT Scan of the head was performed, and no deep tissue involvement was noted.
Reconstruction solutions were offered to the parents but they insisted on non-surgical intervention. Therefore, the patient was treated with non-invasive debridement of the lesion and local therapy, including gentle water cleansing and the application of topical antibiotic ointment. 6 months later, the patient has returned for a follow up. Scar tissue has formed over the defect (). Family history revealed that none of her parents had the same condition; however, two of her sisters did, and were diagnosed with cutis aplasia. The elder one is currently 4 years of age, with right unilateral terminal reduction of the first and second toes (). The other sister was born prematurely and died shortly after birth due to cardiac anomalies.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 72-year-old Chinese man with chronic nuchal pain complained of progressive difficulty in lifting the head over the last 2 years. He also developed difficulty walking due to the loss of horizontal gaze. Past history was notable for hypertension under control. The patient reported no history of trauma and no known neurological deficits. Prior workup by an orthopedic surgeon and a neurologist excluded the diagnosis of any cranial, neurological or autoimmune diseases. A muscle biopsy from the left trapezius muscle demonstrated nonspecific myopathic features. Cervical collar, oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication and exercise rehabilitation were ineffective in correcting his posture for the past 1 year. The patient then sought chiropractic care for his condition.
Upon examination, the patient ambulated with a cane to maintain balance. Gaze was down at the floor, instead of forward. Pronounced head drop with neck flexion caused the chin to rest on the chest in standing or sitting. The center of gravity plumb line (COG PL, red dashed line) is considered a virtual gravity line of the entire body (). Measurements of cervical range of motion (ROM) showed restriction of active motions, where active versus passive extension ROM (normal range: 70°) was 10°/54°, and active versus passive rotation ROM (normal range: 90° to both sides) was 58°/72° each side. The head was able to be passively raised up by hands and the neck deformity resolved when lying supine. Pain intensity of the neck was rated 3-4/10 on an 11-point numeric pain rating scale, where 0 means no pain and 10 means the worst imaginable pain. Motor strength measurement of the cervical extensors with a handheld dynamometer was graded at 4+/5. The patient could maintain the head up with extreme effort only for a couple of minutes. EOS® radiographies ( and ) revealed reverse lordosis (CobbC2-C7 −16°), cervical disc space narrowing with grade 1 anterolisthesis at C3/4 and C4/5 levels (red arrows), and C5-C6 ankylosis (hollow arrow). COG-C7 sagittal vertical axis (SVACOG-C7) ⩾30 mm (red solid line) is regarded as occiput-trunk discordance and SVAC2-C7 ⩾40 mm (purple solid line) is considered to be cervical sagittal imbalance. Needle electromyography revealed myopathic changes in the cervical muscles. Clinical pictures and histological findings were consistent with INEM associated with cervical spondylosis.
The chiropractic regimen consisted of upper thoracic spine manipulation, electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), cervical extension exercises and cervical collar. The splenius capitis, semispinalis capitis, semispinalis cervicis, and trapezius are the key muscles for cervical extension. In order to correct dropped head posture and relieve neck pain, these muscles need to be strengthened specifically. In the presence of instability at C3/4 and C4/5 levels, cervical manipulation was contraindicated. An upper thoracic manipulation was cautiously delivered instead. An inflatable air pump cervical collar was prescribed to maintain neck posture and to relieve neural compression when patient was at home. Greater functional range of active cervical motion was obtained after 2 weeks of treatment 5 times per week. Subsequently, in addition to manipulative therapy, EMS of the neck extensors and cervical extension exercises for muscle strengthening were added in each treatment session. Treatments were delivered 3 times weekly for further 3 months. Dropped head state was almost corrected and neck pain was fully resolved near the completion of treatment. The patient resumed normal daily activities and continued monthly follow-ups. At the 6-month follow-up, he regained upright posture of the head and global sagittal balance (). Repeat standing full-spine EOS® ( and ) depicted substantial improving of most of the radiographic parameters except SVAC7-S1. The C7 plumb line (white dashed line) should fall within 30 mm, either anterior or posterior, to the posterosuperior endplate of the S1.

"A 28-year-old male presented with raised intracranial pressure for two months. Neurological examination of the patient revealed bilateral papilledema. However, there were no focal deficits. MR of the patient revealed T1 hypointense, T2 hyperintense intraventricular lesion filling the bilateral lateral ventricle with avid contrast uptake and central non-enhancing area [Figure –]. There was a non-enhancing area in the right frontal lobe contiguous with the intraventricular lesion as apparent on T2 and FLAIR images []. Patient underwent a parasagittal craniotomy and near total excision of the tumor. The tumor was pinkish gray, very vascular and had areas of necrosis along with thrombosed vessels within. Septum pellucidum was involved and was resected partly along with the tumor. The floor of both lateral ventricles could be appreciated after resection. The right frontal lobe appeared normal intraoperatively. Histopathological evaluation of the resected specimen revealed features of a high-grade tumor comprising of biphasic population of malignant cells. Tumor cells were highly pleomorphic comprising of malignant glial cells including many bizarre tumor giant cells intermixed with bundles of malignant spindle cells. Mitosis was brisk. There was intense endothelial cell proliferation and large areas of palisaded necrosis. Tumor cells showed immunoreactivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin [Figure –]. The patient had a prolonged post-op course due to venous edema which gradually resolved, and he has been subjected to radiotherapy.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 25-year-old man with no past medical or drug history, presented to the emergency room with an acute pain of the right upper quadrant and flank evolving for three days associated with fever. The patient reported no chronic abdominal pain or transit disorders.
Physical examination showed that the patient had fever 39 °c. The abdominal examination revealed the presence of a 10 cm - regularly shaped, soft, and fixed mass in the right hypochondria and flank. The rest of the abdomen revealed no remarkable abnormalities.
Laboratory tests showed a high c-reactive protein level (173.5mg/l) but a normal white blood cell count (7553/μl). No anemia nor hemostasis disorders were noticed. Furthermore, urine culture was normal.
Firstly, we decided to perform an abdominal ultrasound that showed a cystic formation of the right pericolic gutter with a thick wall and several septa within. The mass had close relationships with the sixth liver segment and the ascending colon. At first, we suspected a hydatid cyst of the liver because Tunisia is an hydatid endemic area. However, a malignant tumor of the colon could not be ruled out.
Therefore, we indicated an abdominal CT scan to characterize the mass and determine its exact location. It revealed a regular 10-cm- intraperitoneal cystic mass independent from the liver but repressing the ascending colon with heterogonous internal density. Moreover, the mass was multilocular edged by thick walls showing low contrast enhancement after intravenous injection. Peritoneal effusion was detected on CT scan in the pericolic gutter and douglas pouch, to boot (, ).
An infected cystic lymphangioma was then suspected besides the diagnosis of intraperitoneal hydatid disease or infected malignant tumor of the colon. We decided then to perform open surgery for diagnostic and therapeutic purpose.
We found a 10-cm-cystic-mass containing a serous bloody fluid in the right pericolic gutter depending from the ascending colon. The colon was not distended. No liver metastasis nor peritoneal carcinosis were noticed. An ileocolic en bloc -resection was performed with an immediate ileocolic anastomosis. ().
Macroscopically, the 10 –cm colonic cystic mass had many septas and contained serous fluid. It was obviously arising from the ascending colon. In addition, histopathological examination revealed dilated lymphatic and vascular components lined with attenuated endothelial cells. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of a cystic lymphangioma. The patient's post-operative course was uneventful. He was discharged on the 5th post-operative day. A 6-months clinical and radiological follow-up showed no symptoms or recurrence with good tolerance to regular diet.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 33-year-old Turkish woman patient was admitted with complaints of waist pain that extended down her left leg. She was diagnosed with left L5-S1 paramedian disc herniation and admitted for operation (). In her preoperative neurological examination, she showed a left laseque of 45 degree +, hypoesthesia in left L5, S1 dermatomes and left foot dorsiflexion (DF) strength of 4/5. Left L5 hemipartial laminectomy, L5-S1 discectomy, and foraminotomy were performed. No complication occurred during the operation. Postoperative early neurological examination did not determine any new neurologic deficit. At the postoperative 12th hour, neurological deficiency was observed. Upon neurological evaluation, left foot DF strength was 0/5, plantar flexion (PF) strength was 2/5, and urine incontinence and hypoesthesia in left L4, L5, S1 dermatomes were determined. Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed acute SEH at the surgical site (), and the patient underwent reoperation. Blood clots were evacuated and decompression was performed. There was no active bleeding at the site (). Early clinical recovery was observed after reoperation, On postoperative 5th day neurological examination showed left foot DF strength 2/5, PF strength 5/5 and there was no urine incontinence.

"A 40-year-old woman on treatment for bipolar depression attended the psychiatry outpatient department on May 10, 2014. She complained of excessive tiredness for the past few days and was admitted for evaluation in view of her multiple admissions in the past. She was afebrile with normal vitals and Glasgow Coma Scale of 15. Her psychiatric history revealed bipolar depression for the past 5 years with an episode of depression in 2013. She was on tablet quetiapine 400 mg and tablet valproate 500 mg for July 15, 2013. There was no medical history of diabetes in her or her first-degree relatives. Ten months after the initiation of medication, her weight was 231 lbs (105 kg) with body mass index of 40.92 kg/m2 (height 5 feet 3 inches) indicating class III obesity.
Laboratory investigations revealed an elevated random blood sugar (RBS) value of 443 mg/dl. Urine acetone was positive (+++). Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.1 and bicarbonate 10.54 mEq/L (normal 22–26 mEq/L) and PaCO230 (normal 35–45) revealing a picture of uncompensated metabolic acidosis. Next day fasting lipid profile was done which showed elevated total cholesterol 509 mg/dl (normal <190 mg%) and triglyceride 2871 mg/dl (normal <150 mg/dl). Glycated hemoglobin was 9.2% (normal 4–6.4%) indicating poor glycemic control. Serum pancreatic amylase was 104 U/L (normal 0–137 U/L), and lipase was 114U/L (normal 0–160 U/L). Other investigations such as hemoglobin, total and differential count, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation, renal and liver function tests, lipid profile, serum sodium, and potassium were within the normal limits.
Diagnosis of DKA was made. After consultation with the physician, the patient was aggressively managed with 10 units regular insulin as bolus injection followed by 15 units plain insulin in 500 ml of 0.9% saline given as intravenous infusion at the rate of 15 drops per minute. She was also given intensive fluid management with normal saline and dextrose normal saline. When her blood glucose became 261 mg/dl, the insulin infusion was stopped, and plain insulin 8 units was given eighth hourly subcutaneously. Her fasting and postprandial blood sugars remained high on the consecutive days, and the insulin therapy was stepped up to 14 units in morning, 14 units in afternoon and 10 units at night(14-14-10) on May 17, 2014. Tablet atorvastatin 20 mg once daily was initiated in view of her deranged lipid profile. The dose of quetiapine was stepped down (18th - 300 mg, 20th - 250 mg, and 21st - 100 mg) and stopped on May 22, 2014. The RBS values on 22nd and 23rd were 76 and 90 mg%, respectively, and the patient was discharged with tablet amisulpride 200 mg twice daily and tablet metformin 1000 mg once daily.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"About 6 months before at 22 weeks of gestation, a cystic lesion was identified during a routine obstetric ultrasound examination of the pelvic area in a 23-year-old female patient without any previous discomfort. Due to the compression of the cyst on the cervix, the delivery was achieved by caesarean section. Postpartum ultrasonographic examination showed that there was a 7.5 × 8.5 cm sized thin-walled cystic lesion in the midline of the pelvic region compressing the rectum, uterus and bladder (). The origin of the lesion could not be determined during the ultrasonographic examination. The T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a thin-walled hyperintensity in the uterus, and the rectum posterior while T1-weighted images revealed a hypointense cystic lesion. The cyst was not associated with the ovaries. The fourth and fifth sacral bones were not seen. In the posterior, the cyst was communicating with the spinal subarachnoid space (). Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with sacral agenesis and anterior sacral meningocele. In addition, MRI showed that the conus medullaris ended at the 4th lumbar spine level and a distinct arcuate uterus was observed. The patient's neurological examination was normal. Complete blood count and serum biochemical tests were within normal limits.
Because she planned another pregnancy, gynecological surgeons and neurosurgeons suggested to the patient a surgical management. But she denied.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 55-year-old man with a weight of 76 kg and height of 178 cm, suddenly experienced a nontraumatic loss of consciousness after a cough attack at an upright position as reported by a witness. Two months prior, he was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and had been receiving antituberculosis treatment. On arrival, the patient was unconscious with a Glasgow coma scale score of 6, blood pressure of 169/89 mm Hg, regular heart rate of 85 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 18/minute, body temperature of 36.5°C, SaO2 of 82% at room air, and capillary blood sugar of 110 mg/dL. Auscultation of the lungs revealed an inspiratory crackle at the left lung field. After rapid intravenous access and oxygenation, the patient was sedated, the trachea was intubated, mechanical ventilation was initiated, and conservative treatment was maintained in the intensive care unit. Urgent computed tomography (CT) of the brain was performed and showed multiple air shadows in both hemispheres and the right cerebral vessels (). These lesions suggest air embolism. Twelve hours later, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed and showed a diffuse ischemic stroke in the right and left frontoparietal cortical areas and multiple hypointense signals, which were consistent with cerebral air embolism ().
The brain perfusion images were normal. The chest CT performed at the emergency department showed pulmonary tuberculosis cavity associated with the destruction of parenchyma in the left upper lobe (). There was no evidence of cerebral hemorrhage. The diagnosis of cerebral gas embolism after sudden cough was retained, and immediate treatment was started including 100% oxygen and cardiovascular support while the patient was placed in a supine position. The transthoracic echocardiography was performed, and no patent foramen ovale was found. A lumbar puncture was performed to seek for tuberculous meningoencephalitis. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was considered, but the patient’s condition was too unstable to support transfer to the hyperbaric oxygen center. One day later, his neurological status deteriorated. The patient died on the fourth day with multiple organ failure. No autopsy was performed based on his family’s wishes.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"Twenty three year-old female was complained of mouth opening limitation, TMJ pain and sound. The mouth opening at initial examination was 32 mm (Fig. ). The patient has suffered from this problem, and experienced arthrocentesis before. Under diagnosing to chronic closed lock on both TMJ and anterior disk displacement without reduction in MRI (Fig. ), ultra-thin arthroscopic diagnosis and arthrocentesis was performed, and the adhesion was removed with trocar through the portal of Chung's needle (Figs. , ).

"A 68-year-old male was diagnosed with severe HEMA in early childhood, with less than 0.001% factor VIII activity. The brother of the proband also suffered from severe HEMA, thus the mother must have been carrier of the causative mutation. The children of the proband were male, and consequently, in this part of the family the mutation has not been passed on. Due to the distant past of the diagnosis, no genetic tests had been performed to identify the causative mutation. Around 30% of patients with severe HEMA develop inhibitors during their treatment with factor VIII, especially patients with large deletions and intron inversions. Thus, genetic factors can influence inhibitor development, and different treatment approaches are chosen according to risk of inhibitor development []. However, the proband never developed factor VIII inhibitors, possibly suggesting a smaller and less frequent mutation in F8 than the large intron inversion. Following blood transfusion, the proband was tested positive for HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus in the late 1980s and early 1990s, respectively. The patient was cured for his Hepatitis C infection, but never received any treatment for his HIV-1 infection, since he remained with normal CD4 T cell count over time and was considered an HIV long-term non-progressor (LTNP).
To identify the HEMA causative mutation (as well as possible mutations explanatory for his HIV LTNP phenotype), a blood sample was drawn in EDTA tubes (FLUKA), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated over ficoll gradient (GE-healthcare). Integrating HIV DNA in CD4 T cells might result in false positive (somatic mosaic) mutations, or disturb the quality of sequencing. Therefore, CD4 T cells were depleted by magnetic purification (miltenyi biotec). DNA from non-CD4 T cells was purified using allprep DNA/RNA mini kit (Qiagen). Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed employing Kapa HTP Library preparation and Nimblegen SeqCap EZ MedExome Plus kit and analysed using Nextseq v2 chemistry (2 × 150 bp). SNPs were called relative to hg19. Variant call files (VCF) were uploaded to Ingenuity Variant Analysis (IVA, Qiagen) and variants were compared to population frequencies of variants in the Allele Frequency Community (AFC) database and to frequencies in the 1000 Geneomes project. One hundred thirty thousand six hundred eighty-seven variants were identified in 16,957 genes in the patient, of which seven were located in the F8 gene. Two variants did not pass quality control, thus five variants could be possibly causative (see Table ). Four of the remaining variants had an allele frequency much higher than the disease frequency and were therefore judged as being irrelevant. Therefore, one variant (c.5411_5412delTCT, p.F1804del) remained a potential cause of disease (Fig. ). The mutation was verified in the raw BAM file (Additional file : Figure S1). Ingenuity did not provide any dbSNP ID or frequency for this variant, which is thus denoted as novel. Moreover, the variant was not reported in Coagulation Factor Variant Databases EAHAD.CFDB (), which provides all 5418 known transcript variants in the F8 gene, confirming that the c.5411_5413delTCT, p.F1804del must indeed be novel.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 29-year-old female in her second pregnancy, with a history of tetralogy of Fallot or ventricular septal defect with pulmonary atresia, had undergone 4 surgeries during her childhood, including a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt, patch repair of ventricular septal defect, and a right ventricle (RV) to pulmonary artery (PA) conduit. At 20 weeks’ gestation during her first pregnancy, she developed severe symptomatic stenosis of the RV to PA conduit with a Doppler gradient of 98 mmHg, thus requiring a 22-mm balloon dilatation and Genesis XD stent as a temporizing measure until definitive repair could be undertaken postpartum. However, she was lost to follow-up after delivery of her first child and did not undergo postpartum repair of her RV to PA conduit stenosis.
The patient presented to our clinic during her second pregnancy at 21 weeks of gestation. Thus far, her pregnancy had been uncomplicated and prenatal testing to date had found no abnormalities in fetal development. On presentation, she admitted to mild dyspnea on exertion at a distance of 20 yards. On examination, the patient was tachycardic and normotensive with normal oxygenation. She was euvolemic with hemoglobin of 13.5 g/dL and creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL. Echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60% to 65%, with mild right atrial (RA) dilatation, evidence of RV hypertrophy, and an estimated RV pressure of 82 mmHg. The PA conduit was severely stenosed, with a mean gradient of 52 mmHg and unrestricted pulmonic valve insufficiency. Our assessment determined her modified World Health Organization (WHO) pregnancy risk classification to be II-III (moderately increased risk of maternal mortality and moderate morbidity).
She was seen again in clinic at 34 weeks’ gestation. Her symptoms and repeat echocardiogram were unchanged from the previous visit. However, at 36.5 weeks’ gestation, 2-dimensional echocardiogram done in preparation for delivery identified severe conduit stenosis with a mean gradient of >75 mmHg, peak gradient of 98 mmHg with a peak velocity of 5 m/s, and unrestricted pulmonic valve insufficiency. The patient's RV pressures at the time also exceeded 71 mmHg. Despite the severe restenosis and unrestricted insufficiency of her PA conduit, her symptoms remained New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II. The plan was to admit the patient prior to cesarean section for assessment of heart failure and bilateral tubal ligation at 37 weeks’ gestation.
As planned, she was admitted at 37 weeks for delivery and was cared for by a multidisciplinary team involving obstetrics, ACHD specialists, heart failure specialists, obstetric anesthesia, maternal fetal medicine, and the neonatal intensive care unit.
The patient underwent a successful low transverse cesarean section and bilateral tubal ligation under epidural block with an estimated blood loss of 1,100 mL. Postdelivery echocardiogram showed normal LVEF of 55% to 60%, RA and RV dilatation with RV hypertrophy, and no change in RV pressure or valve gradient. The RV to PA conduit stenosis had decreased to a peak velocity of <4.8 m/s and a mean gradient of <56 mmHg with unrestricted insufficiency.
The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course, only requiring some gentle hydration, and was discharged 3 days postpartum. She was scheduled for follow-up for severe conduit stenosis at 6 weeks postpartum to discuss management options.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 45-year-old African American female presented for evaluation of a left renal mass. She did not complain of any urinary symptoms such as flank pain or hematuria, and her past medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, gastric bypass surgery, and thyroid cancer diagnosed at an outside hospital 20 years previously, which was treated by total thyroidectomy. However, the histologic type of the thyroid tumor was unknown, and neither the outside medical records nor histologic sections of the thyroid tumor were available for review. The patient's primary care physician had told her that imaging studies of her left kidney were suspicious for renal cell carcinoma and had suggested that she undergo nephrectomy. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a 7.5 × 6.8 cm, exophytic, homogeneously enhancing mass in the inferior pole of the left kidney. There was no evidence of hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis, and the urinary bladder, ureters, and adrenal glands were all unremarkable. A percutaneous CT-guided core biopsy of the mass was performed (), and imprints and histologic sections of the biopsy specimen were evaluated and deemed positive for metastatic FTC.
Nine months following biopsy, the patient underwent left radical nephrectomy, and examination of histologic sections of the resection specimen confirmed the cytologic diagnosis made on the core biopsy specimen. She did well in the immediate postoperative period, with no evidence of wound infection, and was discharged. Three years later, she was admitted for malnutrition and dehydration due to an anastomotic leak from her previous gastric bypass surgery. She was discharged after a 2-month inpatient stay, during which she underwent gastrostomy tube placement, and has not been hospitalized since. A repeat CT at that time showed several hypodense lesions in the right kidney, as well as one of intermediate density measuring up to 1 cm in greatest dimension that had remained stable since the previous CT, 3 years earlier. The patient was subsequently lost to follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 26-year-old female with NYHA class III dyspnea on exertion and easy fatigability was referred for surgery with the diagnosis of congenitally corrected transposition of great arteries (CCTGA), restrictive subaortic ventricular septal defect (VSD) and severe subpulmonic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. She was on Propranolol. Clinical examination showed an acyanotic patient with low volume pulses and a grade 3/6 ejection systolic murmur over the left sternal border. Chest X-ray revealed normal heart size, left ventricular (LV) type of apex, right aortic arch, and convex left upper border, suggestive of dilated ascending aorta and normal lung vascularity.
Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed situs solitus, levocardia, AV concordance, side by side orientation of the ventricles, and an anterior leftward aorta. The aorta appeared to override the interventricular septum but no definite VSD could be seen probably because of poor echo window. The pulmonary artery was seen to arise from the right ventricle with no evidence of pulmonary stenosis. A high velocity jet was seen in the subaortic region with a gradient of 100 mmHg. Double outlet right ventricle (DORV) with severely restrictive VSD, L-malposed aorta and unrestricted pulmonary blood flow was suspected on echo.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus rhythm, right axis deviation and LV dominance. The right axis deviation in the ECG was probably due to the side by side orientation of the ventricles. Catheterization showed situs solitus, atrioventricular (AV) and ventriculoarterial (VA) concordance with L-malposed aorta, LV pressure of 215 mmHg and RV pressure of 25 mmHg. There was a gradient of 140 mmHg during pullback from LV to aorta, suggesting severe subaortic LVOT obstruction. LV angiogram [] showed severe hypertrophy of LV, long tunnel-like fixed subaortic stenosis and mid-ventricular systolic narrowing. A diagnosis of ACMGA with severe tunnel-like obstruction of the LVOT was made after catheterization. She underwent LVOT resection and LVOT enlargement with modified Konno technique (ventricular septum opened below the subaortic area with resection of hypertrophied septum, followed by closure of iatrogenic VSD with bovine pericardial patch). The abnormal segmental relationship [] necessitated a combined transaortic and transatrial approach. She had an uneventful postoperative period. Postoperative echocardiogram revealed good relief of LVOT obstruction with residual gradient of 45 mmHg, mainly at mid cavity region []. On 6 months follow up, she was asymptomatic with mild to moderate AR and LVOT turbulence with a gradient of 20 mmHg.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"Our patient was a 44-year-old woman who underwent proximal gastrectomy and bilateral truncal vagotomy for a gastric neuroendocrine tumor. Her immediate postoperative course was uneventful, and no surgical complications, such as anastomotic fistula, were observed. On the third postoperative day, she presented with abdominal discomfort and bloating, nausea and vomiting (Figure ). On the fourth postoperative day, the patient developed severe, watery diarrhea. Her blood pressure suddenly decreased to 60/38 mmHg for unknown reason. An examination revealed that her body temperature was 37.2°C, her pulse was increased at 126 beats/minute, her respiratory rate was 28 breaths/minute and her blood oxygen saturation was 86%. A complete blood count was obtained, and the results revealed a white blood cell count of 2.9 × 109/L with 83% neutrophils and 13% lymphocytes. Analysis of blood gas showed that the patient’s blood lactate level was 8.2 mmol/L and base excess was −9.2. Serum level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was 143.4 mg/L. Blood and urine were collected for bacterial culture, and both test results were negative. The patient was urgently transferred to the ICU. On the fifth postoperative day, her temperature rose to 39.6°C and her pulse rate was 145 beats/minute, and she developed respiratory distress (Additional file ). Endotracheal intubation was performed to allow mechanical ventilation (Figure ). Her degree of diarrhea was aggravated, with a passage of greenish, watery liquid exceeding 1,800 ml. Her white blood cell count had increased to 7.9 × 109/L, and the proportion of neutrophils had risen to 98%. Her platelet count had decreased, and a coagulation test showed a prolonged time to coagulation. Sulbactam, ornidazole, vecuronium, norepinephrine, hydrocortisone and intensive intravenous fluids were administered, owing to concern about septic shock []. The patient was then treated with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) via percutaneous access and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). During the following days, the patient’s vital signs and clinical condition gradually stabilized. VV-ECMO and CRRT were stopped on the 12th postoperative day, but the patient’s diarrhea did not shown any improvement. On the next day, her fever reoccurred, with a peak temperature of 38.7°C (Additional file ). Her white blood cell count rose further to 18.0 × 109/L with 89% neutrophils and 10% lymphocytes. Her blood cultures now yielded Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterococcus faecalis, revealing a polymicrobial sepsis. Multiple antibiotics, including imipenem, caspofungin, penicillin and/or linezolid, and even probiotic bifidobacteria, were administered. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) was performed on days 15 and 22 postsurgery, and no intraabdominal free fluid or abscesses was noted (Additional file and Additional file ). The therapeutic strategies with antibiotics and probiotic were continued until 28 days, when the patient still had a fever (38.3°C) and the volume of watery stools reached 2,855 ml. On that day, the patient’s blood culture grew Propionibacterium acnes. Her white blood cell count returned to normal, but her CRP level remained as high as 103.3 mg/L.

"The patient was a 40-year-old man who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria for schizophrenia. Onset of schizophrenia occurred in his early twenties. The typical antipsychotic drug haloperidol was administered for some time. After he stopped the medication (haloperidol 2 mg) because of tremor, he jumped from a second floor window due to delusions and hallucinations. He was then admitted to the hospital's emergency medical center with a right calcaneal fracture. His right leg joint was fixed in a plastic cast, and he was admitted. Treatment with blonanserin (8 mg) and flunitrazepam (2 mg, at night) was initiated for auditory hallucination. At 1 week later, the blonanserin was increased to 16 mg because his persecutory delusions and auditory hallucinations persisted. After the increase in dose (16 mg), the patient complained of leg restlessness. His global score on the Barnes Akathisia Scale [] was 3 ('moderate akathisia'). Substantial relief of akathisia was noted on the next day of fluvoxamine (50 mg) treatment, at which point his global score on the Barnes Akathisia Scale was 0. At 1 week later, the dose of blonanserin was increased to 24 mg since he still had psychotic symptoms. Fluvoxamine (50 mg) continued to be administered. He had no recurrence of the akathisia. After 1 month, he was discharged home because his psychotic symptoms were improved.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 35-year-old mentally disabled woman with a psychiatric history of obsessive behavior in childhood and anxiety disorder consulted the dermatology department for generalized pruritus. She was diagnosed with atopic dermatitis which resolved after corticoid-based therapy. In 2005, she was referred to our department because of laterocervical lymphadenopathies and night fever with intense sweating. Body computed tomography (CT) showed supra- and infra-diaphragmatic lymphadenopathies with various abdominal masses, the most relevant being 8×6×8 cm3. A biopsy of a lymphadenopathy revealed NS classic HL. With a final diagnosis of NS HL stage IIIB with an International Prognostic Score 2, she received six cycles of ABVD chemotherapy regimen with partial response and an early relapse in March 2006 (primary refractory to ABVD). This was followed by a salvage chemotherapy regimen (two cycles of ESHAP) with no response. In September 2006, a third chemotherapy regimen (four cycles of GemOx) was initiated with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia grade 4, which led to dose-intensity failures followed by chemotherapy discontinuation and radiotherapy consolidation. One month after the last radiotherapy session, the HL progressed; so, two cycles of IFE regimen were given with stable disease. Considering the basal comorbidities of the patient, we decided to pursue a watch-and-wait policy from 2008 to 2010, treating localized areas of progression with radiotherapy and obtaining transient partial responses (). In October 2010, a new mass appeared in D8–D9, presenting with a medullar compression syndrome. After a biopsy that confirmed HL relapse, it was treated with radiotherapy and six cycles of GemOx, which led to a partial response. However, a new progression occurred in the left cervical and axillary nodes within 1 month, which was observed with a watch-and-wait policy with the consent of the family.
In May 2012, our patient presented a new clinically symptomatic disease progression confirmed by positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, requiring bendamustine 90 mg/m2 and finally reaching disease stability. In August 2014, the HL progressed again with significant B symptoms and worsening clinical status (). At this point, based on our experience of the potential role of COX-2 expression in HL, and that the patient was not a candidate for intensive chemotherapy and brentuximab was still not available in our center, we decided to start an experimental treatment with celecoxib 200 mg every 12 hours and lenalidomide 20 mg (for 3 of every 4 weeks). This regimen was obtained through a compassionate use request. Our patient received this treatment from August 2014 to January 2015 (six cycles) with unremarkable toxicity and excellent tolerance, finally showing a CR for the first time in both the interim after three cycles and the final CT/PET after six cycles (). This response was maintained in a new CT scan in August 2015. After this induction, we started 1 year of celecoxib maintenance (200 mg/12 hours) that had to be stopped because of anemia due to gastrointestinal bleeding in March 2016.
In July 2016, with the most durable response until that moment being 22 months, our patient presented a new disease relapse. CT/PET showed supra- and infra-abdominal adenopathies with associated hepatic and splenic lesions. As two different biopsies of hypermetabolic locations resulted negative and keeping in mind the asymptomatic situation of our patient, we decided to restart celecoxib 200 mg every 12 hours. In this context, the disease progressed to ascites requiring paracentesis. Biopsies were constantly negative until February 2017, when a final biopsy confirmed the persistence of HL. At that point, we decided to start brentuximab vedotin (two cycles). During the second cycle of brentuximab, the patient required intensive care admission due to a sepsis with a fatal outcome.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"This is a 14-year-old boy with an extensive family history of HeFH and a brother with HoFH. The boy has a compound heterozygous for the LDLR mutations c.1846-? 2311+?del and c.1895A>T (variant of unknown significance). The boy presented with xanthomas and hypercholesterolemia at 4.8 years of age. High dose (for age) statins and ezetimibe were started (atorvastatin 20–30 mg/day; ezetimibe 10 mg/day). At the age of 8 years, mild aortic regurgitation was evident. Treatment with plasma exchange (PE) was commenced every 15–20 days. Three years later, the patient required composite graft replacement of the aortic valve, aortic root and ascending aorta, with re-implantation of the coronary arteries (Bentall procedure).
At this point, lomitapide was initiated as add-on to the previous treatment regimen, escalating from 5 to 10 mg/day. LDL-C levels decreased to almost 100 mg/dL (Fig. ). Lomitapide dose was increased to 15 mg/day and then briefly escalated to 20 mg, but the patient experienced elevated transaminases, so the dose was reverted with consequent normalization of LFTs. The LA frequency was altered a number of times in this patient (Q2W–Q6W), and was eventually stopped once the patient was on the 15 mg dose of lomitapide. The response to lomitapide was a 66.4% reduction, and apheresis has been discontinued, apart from two emergency sessions when an insurance issue interrupted the lomitapide dosing (Fig. ).","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 54-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for occipital soft tissue swelling and headache. The patient’s history was remarkable for resection and radiation therapy for a hemangiopericytoma (HPC) in the left gluteal musculature 10 years previously. The patient had also undergone multiple pulmonary metastases resections. An ultrasound of the occipital region revealed a heterogeneous soft tissue mass with destruction of the occipital bone of up to 6 cm (Figure ). Computed tomography (CT) of the brain showed an extra-axial mass in the fossa posterior extending through the tentorium and lysis of the overlying occipital bone (Figure ). On MRI the mass was isointense to grey matter on both T1- and T2-weighted images (WI), flow voids were noted (Figure , arrowheads). The lesion demonstrated mildly heterogenous, avid contrast enhancement (Figure ). There was no restricted diffusion. The patient underwent selective intra-arterial embolization before surgical resection to minimize blood loss. Afterwards the patient received adjuvant radiotherapy.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 64-year-old female nursing home medical technician presented to the emergency department with fever and nonproductive cough of one-week duration. Her medical history was notable for venous insufficiency, vertigo, migraine headaches, hypothyroidism, and remote tobacco abuse. In the emergency department, she was febrile (38.2℃), with an otherwise preserved heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate. Her oxygen saturation was 92% on ambient air. Initial, basic laboratory diagnostics were unremarkable, and SARS-CoV2 nasopharyngeal PCR was negative. Chest radiograph demonstrated patchy infiltrates in the right mid and lower lung fields. She was discharged home with recommendations for self-isolation. Over the course of the next 48 hours, she noted ongoing fevers and worsening shortness of breath, prompting a return to the emergency department where she was noted to be febrile (39.5℃) and hypoxic (90% on room air) requiring supplemental nasal cannula. Physical examination was unremarkable except for occasional, generalized scattered crackles and wheezes on lung auscultation. Laboratory diagnostics demonstrated a preserved white blood cell count (5.8 k/uL) with neutrophilic predominance (82.6%) and lymphopenia (13.4%), with an absolute neutrophil count (4.8k/uL) to absolute lymphocyte count (0.8 k/uL) ratio of 6, a preserved hemoglobin (14.1 gm/dL), and mild thrombocytopenia (142 k/uL). The metabolic panel demonstrated mild hyponatremia (130 mmol/L), a preserved creatinine (0.90 mg/dL), and mild elevation of the AST (56 units/L) with a preserved ALT (27 units/L). Inflammatory markers were remarkable for an elevated CRP (118 mg/L), LDH (460 units/L), ferritin (1,962.5ng/mL), and D-dimer (3.38 mcg/mL). Repeat SARS-CoV2 testing on re-presentation as well as one additional test during the course of her hospitalization were negative. Computed tomography was ordered in the setting of her worsening hypoxia and elevated D-dimer and demonstrated bilateral ground-glass opacities with crazy paving patterns worse on right than left, consistent with SARS-CoV2 infection, a left upper lobe pulmonary embolism with associated right heart strain, and an enlargement of the main pulmonary artery (Figure ). She was initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Unfortunately, despite continued management of her pulmonary embolism and conservative management for presumed SARS-CoV2 infection, her clinical condition was complicated by progressive tachypnea and associated hypoxia, necessitating endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. She received three doses of hydroxychloroquine and seven days of azithromycin. Antibiotics were discontinued as she had no evidence of secondary superinfection. Intriguingly, despite initially negative nasopharyngeal swabs, endotracheal sampling demonstrated SARS-CoV2 positivity. She remained on mechanical ventilation was subsequently extubated after seven days. She was transferred to the medical service where her clinical course remained stable and subsequently discharged home on apixaban.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"This is a 4-year-old girl with a homozygous c.2043C>A mutation who presented at the age of 3 with an LDL-C level of 739 mg/dL. Her father has a severe form of HeFH. At diagnosis, the patient had normal echocardiography; but, by 2016, she had mild aortic thickening and some mild aortic valve regurgitation. There was evidence of a pedunculated atheroma at the aortic arch that had potentially embolised as it was no longer apparent on a later scan. For this reason, the treating physician decided that the patient was a candidate for aggressive LLT, but low body weight meant that LA was not suitable. LDL-C levels were reduced very slightly to 685 mg/dL with atorvastatin 10 mg/day and ezetimibe 10 mg/day, and the decision was taken to intensify LLT with lomitapide. Doses were escalated gradually from 2.5 mg/day in 2.5-mg increments given the young age of the patient and low body weight, and LDL-C levels became reduced. By the time the dose was escalated to 15 mg/day in August 2018 (patient now 5 years old), LDL-C had reached a nadir of 235 mg/dL (Fig. ). There have been no side effects in this patient apart from one episode of a loose stools when pancakes were eaten. No liver pathology is evident on ultrasound. The patient has recently had a significant reduction in triglycerides to 21 mg/dL, and so the levels of fat-soluble vitamins are being checked prior to any further dose increase given the young age of the child.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 20-year-old Caucasian man was diagnosed with SLE due to polyarthritis, pleuritis, positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA on human epithelial type 2; HEp-2), positive anti-double-stranded DNA, and biopsy-proven class IV glomerulonephritis. Methylprednisolone 1g/day was started for 3 days followed by prednisone 1mg/kg/day. After 1 month, active renal disease persisted and methylprednisolone treatment was repeated. Thereafter, severe pancytopenia and cytomegalovirus infection were identified. Gancyclovir was administered for 21 days with good response. Cyclophosphamide was started (500mg) but after 1 month he presented daily fever and neck pain. At physical examination, an anterior painful cervical prominence was observed; heart rate 122 beats per minute, temperature 37.9°C and oxygen saturation 91%. Piperacillin/tazobactam was started as pulmonary infection was detected. After 2 days, he developed hypoxemia, vascular shock, severe anemia, lymphopenia (300/mm3), and high C-reactive protein (137.5mg/L; normal range, NR, <5). Thyroid ultrasound revealed well-defined hypoechogenic clusters in both lobes. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was suppressed, free thyroxine (T4) >74.6pmol/L (NR 7.7 to 18), total T4 189pmol/dL (NR 90 to 154), total triiodothyronine (T3) 1.15nmol/L (NR 1.23 to 1.85), and high serum thyroglobulin (650.6μg/L). A purulent substance was obtained on fine needle aspiration (FNA) and drained. Cytological analysis showed only pus cells. Thyrotoxicosis due to infectious thyroiditis was established. Fungal culture of thyroid abscess was partial positive. Amphotericin B and fluconazole were introduced. Tracheal and blood cultures were negative. Another thyroid ultrasound revealed persistent small clusters. He underwent drainage again but no secretion was obtained. He died at day 6 of hospital admission with suppressed TSH, lower free T4 but still high (47.6pmol/L) and low total T3 (0.60nmol/L).

"The patient in our case was a 51-year-old man who had been treated 20 years ago with ascending-to-descending EABG using a 22-mm Dacron graft for CoA. Moreover, he had anatomical anomalies of the right aortic arch with Kommerell’s diverticulum. Eight years ago, the patient experienced hemoptysis due to a PA on the distal anastomosis site and was treated by TEVAR using the GORE TAG Stent Graft System (34 mm × 20 cm) (W.L. Gore & Associated, Inc., Flagstaff, AZ, USA). After TEVAR, the size of the PA decreased, and the patient did not experience hemoptysis.
However, due to a recurrence of hemoptysis, the patient was admitted to a hospital. On admission, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed the presence of a PA in the distal anastomotic site of the graft, which appeared to be the cause of hemoptysis (Fig. ). The stent graft was observed in the distal anastomotic site, as was massive blood flow from the descending aorta. Therefore, the patient was transferred to our institution. Blood pressure was normal on examination, and we initially planned to treat the patient using TEVAR. The stent graft is ideally deployed from a site distal to the coarctation to cover the PA, but in this case, it could not be placed proximally to the PA owing to the anatomical form. Thus, we decided to replace the descending aorta and subsequently performed end-to-side anastomosis of the replaced descending aorta with the graft that was surgically constructed 20 years ago.
The patient underwent a right third intercostal thoracotomy. Because large portions of the lung had adhered to the ascending-to-descending EABG and PA, we modified the initial surgical plan to perform replacement of the descending aorta, followed by end-to-side anastomosis of the graft to the newly replaced descending aorta. The native descending aorta proximal to the anastomosis site was accessible; therefore, we decided to completely transect the descending aorta for decompression of the PA (Fig. ). The descending aorta was clamped between the coarctation and PA and transected. Both sides were closed using 4-0 polypropylene with pledget (ETHICON®). Postoperative contrast-enhanced CT showed the complete disappearance of the diseased aortic arch, including the ruptured PA (Fig. ). The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was transferred back to the previous hospital on the 13th postoperative day to continue rehabilitation. The patient is doing very well at 5 months after the surgery.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 52-year-old woman with faithful and mild personality who has never had medical or psychiatric history and drug/alcohol abuse and dependence was admitted to orthopedic hospital for neck pain after a traffic accident. She was diagnosed with contusion of neck and received painkillers. Three days after the traffic accident, she developed delusions, visual and auditory hallucinations, and her speech became incoherent. Although she was voluntarily discharged from the hospital after 5 days of admission, hallucinations and delusions lasted and she became agitated and violent. She was admitted to the psychiatric ward of our hospital due to psychotic state with disorientation and agitation, 6 days after the traffic accident. On admission (day 1), her physical and neurologic examinations (brain computed tomography, usual blood tests including levels of serum electrolytes, fasting blood glucose, and renal and liver function) showed no remarkable findings. But considerable changes were observed in the plasma levels of HVA and MHPG on admission; the level of HVA was 66.5 ng/mL (normal range for 50–60-year-old subjects, 4.0–15 ng/mL) and the level of MHPG level was 41.8 ng/mL (normal range, 4.0–7.0 ng/mL). Brain magnetic resonance imaging and whole-body computed tomography, electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray were all normal. Thyroid stimulating hormone and free T3 were normal, but free T4 was slightly elevated with 1.79 ng/mL (normal range, thyroid stimulating hormone: 0.50–5.00 μIU/mL; free T3: 2.30–4.00 pg/mL; free T4: 0.90–1.70 ng/mL). Thyroid autoantibodies tests indicated normal titrates of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies 7.7 IU/mL (normal range, 0.0–15.9 IU/mL), but elevation in titrates of antithyroglobulin antibodies (anti-TG) 92.3 IU/mL (normal range, 0.0–27.9 IU/mL).
The clinical course after admission is summarized in . A diagnosis of HE was suspected because of the extensive negative work-up, disturbance of consciousness and psychotic symptoms, and positive anti-TG. On day 16, oral prednisolone (PSL) 50 mg/day was administered. Disorientation, hallucinations, and delusions dramatically improved after the administration of PSL, and plasma levels of HVA and MHPG decreased to 7.2 and 9.9 ng/mL, respectively, on day 19. On day 27, hallucinations and delusions appeared again, and plasma levels of HVA and MHPG increased to 33.1 and 22.4 ng/mL, respectively, on day 33. After that, since a diagnosis of steroid psychosis was suspected, the dosage of PSL was decreased to 45 mg/day and risperidone was started at 2 mg/day. Subsequently, her hallucinations and delusions were alleviated. PSL was tapered, and her psychiatric symptoms gradually improved.

"A 12-year-old girl presented to her general pediatrician complaining of asthenia and weight loss in the previous month. Her past medical and family history were unremarkable. Physical examination revealed a painless hepato-splenomegaly without additional clinical signs. Abdominal ultrasound revealed an inhomogeneous liver appearance, abdominal lymphadenopathy and a hypo-echogenic solid neoformation in front of the celiac artery (35 × 13 mm). The patient was admitted to the Department of Pediatrics of the Meyer Children’s Hospital for further diagnostic investigations.
Physical examination revealed palpable spleen and liver, a right inguinal lymph node of 1 cm and a lymph node in supraclavicular location, without any further objective anomaly. She had no fever. Initial laboratory tests found microcytic iron deficiency anemia (Hb = 9.8 g/dl, MCV = 65.5 ft., Ferritin = 4 ng/ml), with normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), normal total protein and protein electrophoresis, a slight increase of lipase and colic acids with normal amylase. Blood biochemistry for kidney and liver function and urinalysis were normal. Primary immunologic work-up including lymphocyte subset and immunoglobulin levels were normal. Tests for malignancies (tumor markers and peripheral blood smear) and infectious investigations, including Mantoux Test and IGRA Assay resulted negative.
Chest X-ray was negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination of the superior and inferior abdomen with contrast medium confirmed increased liver dimensions and its structural inhomogeneity with zones of signal alteration: some nodular, other confluent. It also revealed increased spleen size with zones of nodular signal alteration and multiple nodular formations in the following locations: hepatic hilar, mesenteric, lombo-aortic, at the retrocavity of the epiploon, and the greatest one in front of the celiac artery (diameter > 3.5 cm).
Suspecting a systemic lymphoproliferative disease, we performed liver and lymph node ultrasound-guided biopsy, which showed negativity of Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for potential agents of infectious diseases (including Mycobacteria and Bartonella species) on lymph node material, while it highlighted a non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, resembling sarcoidosis, and aspects of non-specific inflammation of the liver. (Fig. , ).
Subsequently, we carried out measurements of serum and urinary calcium, serum phosphorus, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE), followed by a complete cardiac evaluation, and a complete ophthalmologic evaluation (including slit lamp), all of which resulted within normality.
At this point, given the biopsy results, we performed further lung studies: pulmonary function tests which showed mild restriction and decreased alveolar capillary diffusion. The chest X-Ray revaluation revealed a pattern compatible with mild fibrosis and enlarged lymph nodes. We decided to carry out a high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT), which showed widespread fibrous strands and multiple enlarged lymph nodes (right paratracheal area, at the supraaortic trunk origin, subcarinal, with the largest in this location measuring 30 × 17 mm, pericardiophrenic, bilaterally at axillary level and along the mammary vessels). The bronchoscopic investigation with analysis of the broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid revealed: macrophages 70%, neutrophils 4% and lymphocytes 26% with a CD4/CD8 ratio of 9.2 (pathological value > 3.5).
Based on these results, we carried out further investigations on liver tissue and lymph node with histochemical techniques: CD68 + nodules were found, suggestive of microgranulomas (Fig. and ).
Having ruled out other diagnoses, with suggestive histological findings in two different tissues (liver and lymph nodes) and considering lung involvement, we made the diagnosis of pediatric-onset adult sarcoidosis.
During hospitalization, the condition of the child had always been good and she had always been afebrile. Considering lymph node hypertrophy and the signs of initial portal hypertension (due to compression of the hepatic vessels), we started therapy with prednisone 40 mg/day, and subsequent cross-therapy with mycophenolate mofetil (250 mg/m2 increasing up to 1 g/m2).
The girl came back to our attention a month after discharge for a follow-up visit: she was found in good general condition, with hepatomegaly and without other clinical signs or symptoms. A brain MRI was performed in order to rule out cerebral involvement and it revealed normal findings. One year later she maintained good clinical condition and normal laboratory tests, therefore MMF was gradually reduced and definitively suspended after 18 months. Now her periodic follow up consist of clinical and laboratory evaluation every 6 months and annual pulmonary function tests, unless clinical or laboratory new findings.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 40-year-old male was admitted to hospital because of chest discomfort and dyspnea. The patient had been well until 2 weeks before admission, when chest pain, cough, and dyspnea had developed. Two days before admission, he could not lie down because of dyspnea. He went to another hospital and a chest X-ray (CXR) was performed. A CXR revealed a widened mediastinum and he was referred to the emergency department of our hospital.
On examination, he appeared dyspneic and presented with orthopnea. His vital signs were normal. He had no peripheral lymphadenopathy. Laboratory tests on admission showed elevated lactate dehydrogenase level of 744 IU/L. The result of arterial blood gas was normal (). A CXR revealed a widened mediastinum and left pleural effusion () and contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed a mediastinal mass of 12 cm by 7 cm, compressing the trachea (). A CT revealed no lymphadenopathy other than the mediastinal lesion.
On hospital day 2, tracheal intubation was performed by an anesthesiologist as the patient was considered to have high risk of suffocation. During the tracheal intubation, the left main bronchus was obstructed completely by a mediastinal tumor and the patient suddenly developed hypoxia. Oxygen was administered through a tracheal tube but the oxygen saturation was approximately 80 percent. ECMO was introduced immediately to recover oxygenation, placing a venous cannula in the right common femoral vein and an arterial cannula in the jugular vein. A CXR after intubation revealed atelectasis of the left lung (). After introducing ECMO, oxygen saturation was maintained at about 98 percent and PaO2 was 96 mmHg (). Percutaneous fine needle biopsy of the mediastinal tumor was performed and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. A provisional pathological diagnosis was LBL. On hospital day 3, chemotherapy, comprised of adriamycin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisolone (CHOP), was started to debulk the mediastinal lesion.
After chemotherapy was started, the mediastinal mass shrank rapidly and oxygenation gradually improved. He was weaned from ECMO on hospital day 8 and weaned from the mechanical ventilation and was extubated on hospital day 28. He did not have any respiratory sequelae after extubation. The final pathological diagnosis was T-LBL. Chromosomal analysis did not reveal any abnormalities and an FISH of the BCR-ABL was negative. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 202 protocol without imatinib (Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group) [] was started on hospital day 23 followed by subsequent consolidation chemotherapy. A CXR performed on day 71 shows disappearance of atelectasis and shrinkage of the mediastinal tumor (). A contrast enhanced CT of the chest performed on hospital day 87 confirmed partial remission of the tumor (). The patient's sister was confirmed as having full-matching HLA and the patient was referred to another hospital to receive allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation.
Adverse reactions during clinical courses were febrile neutropenia, acute kidney injury, which did not require renal replacement therapy, and right femoral subcutaneous abscess caused by cannulation for ECMO. He did not develop bleeding or thromboembolism as complications of ECMO.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 55-year-old man presented with fever and abdominal pain. Abdominal CT showed swelling of the right kidney and low attenuation areas (Figure ). Laboratory tests and renal CT imaging were suggestive of pyelonephritis. However, multiple cavitary lesions were also found on the routine chest radiography performed on admission. VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery) lung biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma presumably from the kidney. Therefore, a renal tumor with multiple pulmonary metastases, was considered. At the time, transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) was suspected, which later proved to be a misdiagnosis, and chemotherapy with MVAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin, and cisplatin) was given. However, the chemotherapy was not effective, and the patient died of respiratory failure 2 months later. On autopsy, the primary tumor was found to be a collecting duct carcinoma, and there were lung, liver, spleen, bone marrow, right adrenal gland, and para-aortic lymph node metastases. CT done while the patient was alive detected lung (Figure ), liver (Figure ), and para-aortic lymph node (Figure ) metastases.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 10-year-old boy presented with inability to walk since 2 days with difficulty in swallowing, dysphonia and drooling of saliva. There was no history of recent infection, fever, diarrhea, convulsions or trauma or recent immunization. His antenatal, postnatal details were not significant.
On clinical evaluation, he was conscious and irritable. Neurological examination revealed the generalized hypotonia; weakness started with lower limbs then progressed to involve both upper limbs. However, respiration was normal. The anterior abdominal muscles were weak, and the patient could support himself with difficulty in sitting position. He had lower motor neuron type of facial paralysis.
The patient had irritability and fundoscopy was suggestive of bilateral papilledema. Hence, cerebrospinal fluid analysis was deferred in our patient. He was treated for raised intracranial pressure with mannitol and 3% NaCl. Emergency computed tomography (CT) scan head was done which revealed vasogenic edema in bilateral fronto-parietal and left temporal regions and infarcts. Further evaluation with MRI study was suggested.
Magnetic resonance imaging brain study was done based on CT scan findings MRI revealed white matter lesions in the brain, pons and thoracic levels of the spinal cord. It revealed peripherally enhancing lesions in right fronto-parietal and left fronto-temporo-parieto-occipital region involving grey and white matter, subcortical region and corpus callosum; suggestive of ADEM. Multiple altered signal intensity areas, largest size 5.3 cm × 3.6 cm, were seen involving grey matter and bilateral periventricular deep white matter [].
Electro-diagnosis showed an important reduction of conduction velocity that is, mild generalized motor sensory axonal polyneuropathy (acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy-GBS).
Fundus evaluation revealed bilateral optic neuritis after 3 weeks of illness [Figure and ]. However, there was no clinical deterioration of vision or retro-orbital pain.
Based on clinical findings and electromyography-nerve conduction velocity, a diagnosis of GBS was made and based on MRI findings and fundoscopy, concurrent diagnosis of ADEM and GBS was considered.
Hence, the treatment followed with intravenous immunoglobins (2 g/kg) for 2 days and intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day) for 3 days.
There was gradual improvement in motor power to 3/5 within about 2 weeks. The patient showed significant clinical improvement after 4 weeks and could stand with support and walk with assistance.
The patient was advised physiotherapy and discharged on oral steroids prednisolone at (1 mg/kg/day) in tapering doses over 4 weeks period. However, this could be considered as the first episode of MS with optic neuritis, therefore, our patient will be evaluated on follow-up for further episodes and treatment with immunomodulators.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"On March 12, 2020, an 81-year-old man diagnosed with COVID-19 was admitted to Huoshenshan Hospital following 50 days of intermittent fever and 40 days of chest distress and shortness of breath (). Type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and aortic dissection were associated comorbidities. On February 1, nucleic acid results for SARS-CoV-2 were positive. During prior hospitalization, digestive tract bleeding with black stool were observed; a CT scan showed bilateral patch shadow, a small amount of pleural effusion on the right lung, and aortic dissection. On admission, SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG levels were, respectively, 20.89 g/L and 187.92 g/L. Treatment included chloroquine phosphate (2 tablets, twice daily) and/or convalescent plasma from COVID-19 patients (400 mL) from March 15 to 26. On March 23, nucleic acid test results were positive for swab. On March 25, the patient’s feces were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. A CT scan showed substantial improvement, with marked reduction of pulmonary lesions, on March 24. On March 27, he received DNVr treatment alone (100/100 mg, one tablet twice daily).

"A 62-year-old male with past medical history of type 2 DM (DM-2) and hypertension of 20 years presented to our emergency room with progressive dyspnea that had worsened gradually over the last three months. He was being treated in another facility with questionable diagnosis of congestive heart failure with incomplete response to diuretic therapy. There was no history of chest pain, cough, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He was a nonsmoker and had used alcohol occasionally. There was no recent viral or flu-like illness. On careful questioning, he complained of difficulty in walking and weakness in his legs. The patient denied any back pain, fever, weight loss, bladder involvement, or pain and paresthesias in his extremities. Neurological examination revealed bilateral symmetric muscle weakness with power of 4/5 in upper proximal and distal extremities and 3/5 in lower proximal and distal extremities. There was no ptosis or gaze paresis. Cranial nerves I–XII were grossly intact. There was no evidence of atrophy of the hand muscles and fasciculations. Sensory exam revealed decreased pinprick sensation distal part of extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were graded one in both upper and lower extremities. His blood pressure on admission was 161/106 mm Hg. A fasting blood glucose done at emergency room triage was 229 mg/dL. The clinical and functional examinations did not correlate with the severity of dyspnea. Arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed respiratory insufficiency (pO2 of 60 mm Hg, pCO2 of 58 mm Hg, and SaO2 of 89%).
Initially, chest radiograph was obtained which revealed normal lung fields with no evidence of fluid overload. Serum electrolytes and thyroid panel were found to be normal. β-natriuretic peptide level and 2-D echocardiogram results were inconsistent with heart failure. Adequate glycemic control was achieved with insulin, and serial ABGs remained unchanged on day 1. As the diagnosis leaned towards neuromuscular involvement, bilevel positive alveolar pressure (BiPAP) was started which was followed by serial vital capacities and negative inspiratory pressure (NIP). CSF analysis narrowed the differential to demyelinating neuropathy, which proved to be inconsistent with Gullian-Barré syndrome. EMG analysis revealed sensorimotor polyneuropathy that was predominantly axonal and demyelinating in nature (). In the meantime, the patient's vital capacity dropped to 0.7 liters with NIP of −26 cm H2O. Anti-paraneoplastic antibody screening with ANA and anti-MAG levels were noncontributory. On day 4, the CSF culture was negative. As diabetic polyradiculopathy was considered the most likely diagnosis, intravenous immunoglobulin IVIg 0.4 g/kg/day was started for five days. The patient tolerated the treatment well and showed both subjective and objective improvement as assessed by serial ABGs, vital capacity, and NIP assessment (). The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center in stable respiratory condition with intermittent nasal oxygen insufflation and overnight BiPAP ventilation.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 2-year-6-month-old male child, born to non-consanguineous parents, presented with persistent facial swelling, abdominal distention and reduced urine output for 6 weeks. He had recent onset breathing difficulty. He was a known case of NS being treated with prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day. His antenatal and postnatal history were uneventful. His nutrition and immunization status were appropriate for his age. He had nil significant family history.
On examination, the child was active and alert. Anthropometric examination recorded findings appropriate for his age. Examination of vitals revealed tachycardia (heart rate: 108/min), tachypnoea (respiratory rate: 27/min) and oxygen saturation of 93% in room air. He had elevated blood pressure of 130/90 mmHg (>95th percentile for his age and height) and pitting pedal edema.
Routine blood investigations, including renal and liver function tests were within normal limits. His baseline coagulation study and thyroid function test were normal. Urine analysis revealed nephrotic range proteinuria (4+ on dipstick and elevated protein creatinine ratio of 15.78) and microscopic hematuria. He also had hypoalbuminemia (1.4 g/dL) and hypercholesterolemia (1427 mg/dL). Ultrasound showed moderate pleural effusion, ascites and enlarged hyperechogenic kidneys. Suspecting SRNS, renal biopsy was performed, which revealed features of FSGS (). In view of severe anasarca and respiratory distress, he was initiated on albumin infusion with 20% albumin, 1 g/kg followed by diuretics, furosemide 1mg/kg/dose. After 2 sessions of combined albumin and diuretic therapy, edema settled and albumin level increased to 2 g/dL. Genetic study using targeted exome sequencing, revealed heterozygous missense mutation in exon 14 of ANLN gene that results in amino acid substitution of methionine for threonine at codon 821 (p.Thr 821Met;ENST00000265748.7). Currently, he is being treated with tacrolimus 0.1 mg/kg/day and enalapril 0.3 mg/kg/day, along with normal protein and no added salt diet.

"A 56-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure developed a gradual decrease in vision in her left eye over a 2-month period prior to her first examination. Two weeks prior to her first visit, she developed left eye pain, radiating upward. She negated headaches, diplopia, or problems with her right eye. She was currently on insulin, antihypertensive medication, and aspirin. The results of the first ophthalmologic examination revealed optic disc edema and RAPD in the left eye. Visual acuity was 0.8 in the right eye and 0.13 in the left eye.
Initial laboratory testing included syphilis serology, Lyme disease (Borrelia antibodies), determination of HGB, electrolyte status, ACE, blood count, CRP, and ESR. The results of all the tests were negative or normal except Lyme disease serology (IgG 239 (pos), IgM 9 (neg)), low ACE (2 U/L), and eosinophilic cells (high).
An MRI performed 1 week later revealed enlargement and enhancement in the left nerve sheath from the eye to the chiasma, in line with the findings seen in OPN ( and ).
At a new consultation 1 month after her first visit, BCVA was unchanged. A visual field test revealed a general constriction of the visual field of the left eye, with equivalent neural capacity of 99% in his right eye and 33% in his left eye. Fundus examination showed progression of the left optic disc edema (). RAPD was still present. New laboratory tests that included ESR, CRP, ACE, and sarcoidosis revealed nothing abnormal.
One month later, 2 months after her first examination, the left optic disc edema had regressed but an RAPD was still present. Visual acuity was unchanged since her last visit. Treatment with prednisone was initiated, 60 mg/day, which was tapered to 25 mg/day over 4 weeks when she was examined again.
At a fourth consultation, 3 months after her first visit, visual acuity was 0.8 in both eyes. A SST color vision test revealed that the patient had more defective color vision in her left eye (35 p), compared to the right (15 p). The optic disc edema was reduced. The steroid dose was tapered to 5 mg/day during 3 weeks. At this point, the patient suffered her first relapse with dimmed vision in her left eye. Fundus examination 1 week later revealed a pale papilla. BCVA was now 0.8 in her right eye and 0.4 in her left eye. Steroid dose was increased to 30 mg/day and tapered to 20 mg/day until the next appointment 2 weeks later. Some days later, the patient was hospitalized with arrhythmia due to hypercalcemia and hyperkalemia. At the new consultation, visual acuity was 0.8 in her right eye and 0.5 in her left eye.
The steroid dose was lowered with 2.5 mg per week. At 10 mg/day, she suffered a second relapse and received intravenous steroids. Her corticosteroid dose was increased to 30 mg/day in addition to azathioprine (150 mg/day). A fundus examination 3 months later revealed a normal optic disc with no edema. One month later, the steroid dose had been tapered to 17.5 mg/day. BCVA was 0.8 in both eyes. An SST color vision test revealed defective color vision in both the right (30 p) and the left eye (40 p). The fundus examination showed no sign of optic disc edema.
Four months later, it was suspected that the patient was suffering from sarcoidosis. Liver and spleen biopsies were positive for granulomas.
Four months later, she had a third relapse. She was taking 150 mg azathioprine and no corticosteroids at this time. Both eyes were affected; BCVA was 0.4 in her left eye and 0.65 in her right eye. A fundus examination revealed blurred borders of the optic discs in both eyes.
At a new consultation 2 months later, she remained on azathioprine, 150 mg/day, and was taken off corticosteroids. BCVA was 0.5 in her right eye and 0.65 in her left eye. Fundus examination showed no optic disc edema. A new MRI added support to the OPN diagnosis.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 60-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with a complaint of right lower abdominal pain. The patient did not have same symptoms before, and he only had a medical history of asthma. The laboratory data on admission showed a slightly elevated WBC count of 9,300/μl and a CRP level of 1.0 mg/dl, but the tumor marker levels (CEA, CA19-9) were almost within the normal limits. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a 15-cm large cystic mass, like a dilated intestine, and fluid collection was observed inside.
The cystic mass was adhered to the ileum, but there was no definite communication to the ileum. The feeding arteries of the cyst were communicating branches from the upper mesentery artery, and the lymph nodes around the cyst were slightly swollen (Figure a,c). At the small-bowel follow-through exam, the cyst did not come out, but it did exclude normal intestine (Figure b). There were not significant findings during a colonoscopic examination.
Based on these findings, we diagnosed the cyst as an ileal duplication and decided to perform surgery in order to prevent a recurrence of abdominal pain and lethal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.
We employed a four-port laparoscope-assisted resection of the duplicated ileum and segmental resection of the normal ileum. An umbilical port was used for a mini-laparotomy with a zigzag skin incision (Figure a). The cyst’s stalk was attached to the base of the mesentery of the terminal ileum, approximately 40 cm from the ileocecal junction (Figure b,c). After resection of the cyst, a side-to-side anastomosis of the ileum was made with a stapler.
The resected specimen showed an ileal duplication of 18 × 7 cm in diameter, filled with purulent matter with some ulcers inside (Figure a). The histological findings showed that it had a mucus gland inside, like intestinal epithelium, and was covered with two layers of smooth muscle. There was no communication between the duplication and normal ileum, but they had a common muscle layer (Figure b,c).
The postoperative period was uneventful without any asthma attack, and the patient was discharged on the 13th postoperative day.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 28-year-old woman presented to our tertiary care hospital reporting concerns of left arm weakness and paresthesia for three hours. The weakness started suddenly when she was sitting in her office. Two weeks before presentation, she developed right leg weakness at breakfast that resolved completely within 1.5 hours. One week before presentation, she developed the blurred vision in both eyes that also resolved completely within one hour. Her mother was diagnosed with MS at age 40 and is on treatment with frequent relapses. The rest of the patient’s medical and surgical history was unremarkable.
Her Glasgow Coma Scale score was 13/15 (eye [E] 4, verbal [V] 5, motor [M] 4). Her blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, heart rate was 80 beats/minute, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/minute, and she was afebrile. Her neurological examination showed normal mentation with intact cranial nerves with unremarkable results from her funduscopic examination. Her motor examination showed normal bulk in all muscles with no fasciculation and tremors. Her motor strength, as tested on the Motor Research Council scale, was as follows. Her neck muscles flexion was 5/5, and extension was 5/5. Her right deltoid was 5/5, left was 4/5. Her biceps and triceps were 5/5 (right) and 3/5 (left). Her right iliopsoas was 4/5; her left was 5/5. Her knee flexion/extension was 4/5 (right), 5/5 (left), and foot dorsi/plantar flexion was 5/5. Her right biceps/triceps reflexes were 2+, her left biceps/triceps reflexes were 3+. Her patellar reflex was 2+, and her ankle reflex was 2+. Her Babinski reflex was absent. She was able to walk without support. The findings of her cerebellar and sensory exams were unremarkable.
Her care team suspected transient ischemic attack, and she was sent for urgent computed tomography (CT), which showed no remarkable findings. Blood and metabolic profile test findings were unremarkable, and her low-density lipoprotein was 150 mg/dl. Her cerebrospinal fluid detailed report findings were within reference ranges with no oligoclonal bands and a healthy IgG index, but her MRI showed periventricular hyperintensities in the periventricular area (Figure ). Magnetic resonance angiography findings were unremarkable.
We started the patient on 1000 mg of IV methylprednisolone daily to treat the suspected acute flare of MS. After three days of treatment, the patient’s symptoms were improved, and she was discharged on aspirin and glatiramer acetate (GA) with instructions to return after one month for follow-up if she remains stable. She visited the outpatient clinic after six months and was doing fine, but she reported that she was experiencing difficulty concentrating and was unable to work with enthusiasm. She also reported concerns about frequent mood changes and being mostly tearful when she was formerly a very happy person. We sent the patient for a psychiatric evaluation and checked for NOTCH3 mutation. To our surprise, she had a missense mutation in exon 11 of NOTCH3, a mutation suggestive of CADASIL. Her GA was stopped, and she started aspirin and statin therapy with the advice of further cognitive evaluations and regular psychiatric assessments. She was also advised to seek genetic counseling and testing of NOTCH3 mutation in her mother.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"The case we present here is about a 40-year-old man who was referred to our pain clinic with severe ischemic pain of right lower limb. The pain started gradually 10 months back and became very severe for the last 1 month. The intensity of pain was increasing in both the sitting and lying down positions and decreasing in a standing position. Many non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were tried earlier without much benefit. Over the last 1 month, the severity of the pain was so bad that the patient had to stand all the time and sitting or decubitus position was not tolerable even for 1 min. His sleep was so miserable that he had been taking small naps in that standing position leaning onto some support. He had carcinoma rectum for which he underwent abdominoperineal resection 8 years ago. There was history of smoking prior to that. After the surgery, he had been leading a near normal life driving auto rickshaw for a living until he developed the present problem. There were many gangrenous ulcers over his right thigh and leg. A computed tomography-angiogram was done previously that showed a thrombus in the right common iliac artery measuring about 9.5 cm extending up to the right superficial femoral artery with a near total occlusion of the lumen and poorly developed collaterals. He was scheduled for a conventional peripheral angiogram for deciding on the further plan. However, he could not lie down in the catheterization laboratory due to severe pain and was referred to our Department of Pain Management. We initially tried a conservative approach with a combination of oral pregabalin, diclofenac, paracetamol, and tramadol as per the standard dosage protocol for 2 days. When there was no satisfactory pain relief, we planned epidural analgesia. However, the problem here was the positioning. Patient was not able to tolerate either sitting or lateral decubitus position even for 1 min. He was somewhat comfortable only in the standing position. Considering the special situation, though not conventional, we decided to place the epidural catheter in that standing position. An intravenous line was started using an 18G venous cannula. Electrocardiogram, pulse oximeter, and non-invasive blood pressure monitors were connected. Patient was made to stand besides the operating table holding on to it for support. He was also supported by a technician from the front []. After painting and draping the back, L 4-5 inter-space was identified and local anesthesia was given with 2% lidocaine. Epidural space was engaged with 18G Tuohy needle using loss of resistance to air technique. The epidural catheter was carefully threaded and placed such that the length of the catheter was 5 cm in the epidural space. Catheter was gently aspirated to check for blood and cerebro-spinal fluid and was fixed after subcutaneous tunneling for about 5 cm []. Patient was reassured and gently placed on the operating table in the supine position. A quick test dose was given with 3 ml of 2% lidocaine with 15 mcg adrenaline confirming the epidural placement followed by a bolus of 10 ml of 1% lidocaine along with 1 ml of 7.5% sodium bicarbonate. The pain was relieved within 1 min and the vital signs were stable. Epidural infusion was maintained thereafter with a solution of 0.125% bupivacaine and dexmedetomidine 2 mcg/ml at the rate of 5 ml/h. Patient was very comfortable and slept peacefully. Next day peripheral angiogram was performed, which confirmed the findings of CT-angiogram. Balloon angioplasty was attempted after 2 days, but was not successful and an above knee amputation was performed subsequently. Epidural catheter was removed after 2 days and further pain control was achieved satisfactorily with oral medications.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 49-year-old Caucasian man was referred to our department for further examination of a markedly elevated serum ferritin concentration, of 2012 μg/L (normal range 30-400 μg/L). This had been identified as an incidental finding during the investigation of an allergy. His serum transferrin saturation of 29% was within the normal range. His liver enzymes and hematological evaluation were normal. The HFE gene showed wild-type sequence and an abdominal ultrasound showed normal liver echotexture. Our patient reported bilateral lens replacements 20 years ago due to bilateral juvenile cataracts. His family history was not available because he was an orphan.

"A 27-year-old male presented with multiple cervical and mediastinal lymphadenopathies. The excisional biopsy disclosed classical HL, nodular sclerosis subtype, characterized by architectural effacement by nodular collagenous bands, and a mixed-population inflammatory background including numerous eosinophils admixed with Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells. Computed tomography (CT) scan of chest and pelvis revealed lymphadenopathies in bilateral neck and superior mediastinum; multiple bone lesions in T1, 2, 12, and L4 vertebrae and right ischium. Whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed multiple sites of bone and liver involvement. The diagnosis was classical HL, nodular sclerosis type, Ann Arbor stage IVEB (stage IV: diffuse or disseminated foci of involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs or tissues; E: extranodal organ involvement; B: presence of systemic symptoms like fever and loss of weight), with liver and bone metastasis. He experienced a short remission after 12 cycles of primary chemotherapy with ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) and then relapsed in para-aortic lymph nodes. After ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisolone, cytarabine, and cisplatin) salvage chemotherapy, he received subsequent high-dose BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) chemotherapy conditioning and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. However, his disease relapsed 5 months thereafter. Subsequent chemotherapeutic regimens of vinorelbine + gemcitabine and DVIP (dexamethasone, etoposide, ifosfamide, and cisplatin) only achieved a limited period of partial clinical response. Re-biopsy of the chest wall soft-tissue mass confirmed classical HL with cluster of differentiation 30 (CD30) expression. BV was then administered, but after three cycles of treatment, rapid progression occurred (). The patient experienced a severe skin reaction to subsequent lenalidomide treatment. Immunotherapy with pembrolizumab was then initiated, and his disease responded well for 16 months () until the PET scan showed progression with recurrent bony involvement and relapse (). Because of the limited options for subsequent treatment and the patient being medically unfit for allogeneic stem cell transplantation, a combination of BV and pembrolizumab was initiated, and remission was achieved for > 15 months ().","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 30-year-old woman from Saudi-Arabia was admitted to our department of internal medicine with the strong suspicion of first manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia. Laboratory testing showed mild anemia and thrombocytopenia with normal leukocyte count. The differential blood cell count, however, showed 47% leukemic blasts. A bone marrow biopsy was performed immediately. With approximately 90% blasts the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was confirmed. Flow cytometry showed an expression of CD34, HLA-DR, CD38 and cyMPO. A cross-lineage of CD56 was found, which correlates with a poor prognosis []. Cytogenetics and molecular analysis of the bone marrow cells revealed an ETV6-gen deletion in 12p13. According to the hematologic protocol intensive induction chemotherapy with HAM (high-dose Ara-C and Mitoxantron) was immediately initiated.
On day 8 after admission (2 days after the first cycle of chemotherapy was finished) the patient developed neutropenic fever up to a temperature of 39.4°C. The first laboratory testing showed a decrease in leukocytes down to 0.4 G/l with a C-reactive protein (CRP) less than 0.1 mg/dl. Escherichia coli with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was isolated from initially taken blood cultures, whereas all other clinical and diagnostic examinations (x-ray of the chest, urine, echocardiography and ultrasonography) were normal. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics was immediately initiated with Piperacillin/Tazobactam and switched to Meropenem after microbiologic testing confirmed ESBL sepsis. On that first day of fever, the patient told us, that she fell in the bathroom hurting her right knee two days before (day 6 after admission). There was no apparent injury on her leg. On further clinical examination, besides fever, her vital signs were always normal. In the course of the next 2 days neutrophils dropped below 0.1 G/l and CRP levels soared to a peak of 29.9 mg/dl. Highest procalcitonin level (PCT) measured was 1.7 ng/ml. Three days after the patient suffered from the minor injury to her lateral thigh, she suddenly presented a small hematoma with only little pain (day 9 after admission). There were no signs of superinfection of the hematoma explaining the clinical and laboratory signs of this unclear systemic infection. On that day, the patient was first presented to the surgical department. Within the next two days, the hematoma rapidly changed to a big untypical necrosis of the skin (day 11 after admission, see Figure ). Therefore, the patient was again presented to the surgical department. The patient was still in a good general condition with only little pain. A CT scan was initiated and showed entrapped air under the site of necrosis. Although the skin manifestation was not typical for a necrotizing soft tissue lesion, we considered the possibility of an untypical case of NF during severe neutropenia. Therefore, a surgical exploration was performed immediately (see Figure ). Macroscopically, subcutaneous tissue, fascia and muscle showed the typical characteristics of necrotizing fasciitis with grey necrotic tissue, facial edema, vessel thrombosis and non-contacting muscle. Intraoperative, there was only minimal resistance dissecting the subcutaneous fascia off the deep fascia, which is commonly described as positive “finger test” []. The histological findings showed facial necrosis, vasculitis, thrombosis and suppuration of the veins and arteries coursing through the fascia. But, there were no signs of disease-causing bacteria or infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the deep dermis and fascia as expected. First microbiological testing did not find any bacteria. The initial histopathological report could not confirm the typical picture of necrotizing fasciitis (see Figure ). In the further course of time, intensive care medicine was needed. After confirmation of adequate morphologic blast clearance in the bone marrow supportive treatment with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was added on day 18 (after start of chemotherapy). Neutrophils eventually recovered on day 23 (>500/μl). After beginning to recover, histopathological analyses of additional specimen of surgical resections showed the expected typical pathological findings like inflammatory cells and bacteria. Furthermore, microbiological testing confirmed ESBL infection. A multiplicity of operations with extended debridement was performed in order to eradicate the infection using negative pressure wound therapy. After successful eradication the skin defect involved the complete lateral thigh including nearly the whole circumference of the lower leg. In the further course of time, the immense skin defects had to be prepared for further reconstructive surgery. Reconstructive surgery with mesh graft harvest was complicated by the limited residual skin available on the lower extremity and the delay on wound healing of the harvest sites. Due to unfavorable cytogenetics and the complicated course of treatment our patient was assigned to undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation in first remission. But, the transplantation was only possible with wounds totally closed. It took another six surgical interventions and nearly eight months to finally close all wounds (see Figure ). After further recovery the patient underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation as planned. Today, she is doing well and there is no evidence of disease.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 29-year-old Japanese woman was admitted with lowered consciousness and a high fever (>39°C), arthralgia, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy that had persisted for a week. She had a history of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and macrophage activation syndrome when she was 9 years old and was treated with oral prednisolone until she was 15 years old. Brain MRI showed bilateral swelling and high signal intensity in the basal ganglia and thalamus according to T2-weighted images and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (shown in Fig. , b). Blood examinations revealed the following: leukocyte count, 5,100/μL (88% neutrophils); hemoglobin, 14.3 g/dL; platelets, 110,000/μL; C-reactive protein, 5.36 mg/dL; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 29 mm/h; slightly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, 84 U/L, and alanine aminotransferase, 16 U/L), elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor, 1,261 U/mL, and an elevated serum ferritin level of 4,088 ng/mL (reference range, 5–152 ng/mL). The kidney function test results were within normal limits, the antinuclear antigen was at the borderline level, and the rheumatoid factor and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody tests were negative. Her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on admission showed an opening pressure of 7 cm H2O, 7 cells/mm3 (71% lymphocytes), increased protein levels (265 mg/dL; normal, <40 mg/dL), and a slightly low glucose level (48 mg/dL; normal, >50 mg/dL). Blood, urine, and CSF cultures were negative. Viral meningitis (human herpesvirus 1–6) was excluded using CSF in a polymerase chain reaction assay. An extensive infectious disease evaluation was negative. Her consciousness disorder improved without treatment, and her brain MRI also showed an improvement 3 weeks after admission (shown in Fig. , d). Nevertheless, a high fever, arthritis, and salmon-colored rash on her trunk and limbs persisted (shown in Fig. ). Abdominal CT revealed splenomegaly.
After excluding infections, malignancies, and other rheumatic diseases, ASD was diagnosed based on the presence of fever, arthritis, rash, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and hepatic dysfunction, according to the Yamaguchi criteria []. Her schistocytosis and worsening of anemia (hemoglobin, 8.7 g/dL) became clinically evident, and oral prednisolone of 45 mg (1 mg/day/kg) was administered. TMA was ruled out because of her normal platelet count (162,000/μL), normal kidney function (creatinine, 0.60), and normalized fever without any neurological signs. After administering oral prednisone for 2 days, the patient presented with blurred vision in the left eye and was referred to the ophthalmology department. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/17 in each eye, and her intraocular pressure was normal at the initial visit. A slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment of the eye was unremarkable. A funduscopic examination revealed bilateral cotton-wool spots, Purtscher flecken, and a small number of intraretinal hemorrhages around the optic nerve and in the posterior pole (shown in Fig. ), which were compatible with Purtscher-like retinopathy []. Optical coherence tomography showed inner retinal thickening consistent with cotton-wool spots in both eyes (shown in Fig. ). Fundus fluorescein angiography showed hypofluorescence in the early phase and increased permeability in the late phase, consistent with the lesions (shown in Fig. ). There was no apparent nonperfusion area in either eye.
Despite treatment with high-dose oral prednisolone for 2 weeks, her laboratory data gradually worsened, showing elevated serum ferritin levels (5,663 ng/mL) and developed macrophage activation syndrome []. Therefore, intravenous pulse methylprednisolone therapy was initiated at 1,000 mg/day for 5 days, followed by oral prednisolone of 90 mg (2 mg/kg/day). Nine days after the administration of intravenous pulse methylprednisolone therapy, the patient's serum ferritin levels dropped to 462 ng/mL, and aspartate aminotransferase levels and the platelet count fell within normal limits. TCZ (8 mg/kg every week during hospitalization and 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks after discharge) was administered considering the severity of ASD (shown in Fig. ). The patient visited the ophthalmology department again 15 days after the administration of intravenous pulse methylprednisolone therapy, and her funduscopic examination revealed reduced bilateral cotton-wool spots and Purtscher flecken (shown in Fig. ). Her ASD was successfully treated, and the oral prednisolone treatment was tapered. Although her Purtscher-like retinopathy improved as her ASD activity decreased, nerve fiber layer defect (NFLD) in both eyes appeared 7 months after initial visit (shown in Fig. ). Humphrey visual field testing showed visual field defect corresponding to NFLD (shown in Fig. ). At her last visit, that was 1 year after the administration of intravenous pulse methylprednisolone therapy, the patient was taking prednisolone (5 mg/day) and continuing TCZ, and she remained in good health without a major ASD flare.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 32-year-old Caucasian male presented to the Ophthalmology Service at the Rocky Mountain
Regional Veterans Affairs Medical Center for evaluation of several months of bilateral eye
redness and blurry vison. Review of systems was notable for simultaneous onset of diffuse
erythema, tenderness, induration, and pruritus of a large black ink tattoo over the right
arm and chest (). This
tattoo was inked 1 year prior to presentation. He had 2 other tattoos completed 10 years
before, which were unaffected ().
At the time of initial presentation, ophthalmological examination with slit lamp revealed
anterior chamber inflammation and iris synechiae. On optical coherence tomography, there was
evidence of macular edema (). Skin examination was significant for inflammation, induration, and scant
desquamation in a pattern that closely matched the borders of the tattoo. Lungs were clear
to auscultation. The rest of the history and physical examination was unremarkable.
No clinical or serological evidence for other uveitis-associated diseases was elicited,
including infections, sarcoidosis, or spondylarthritis. Comprehensive metabolic panel,
complete blood count, urinalysis, thyroid stimulating hormone, free T4, ferritin, creatine
phosphokinase, and aldolase tests were within normal limits. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
was 13 mm/h, and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme concentration was 86 U/L (14-82).
C-reactive protein, HLA-B27, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody
(including cytoplasmic, perinuclear, and atypical ANCA), lysozyme, QuantiFERON, HIV,
hepatitis B and C serologies, rheumatoid factor, anticyclic citrullinated peptide
antibodies, and computed tomography of the chest were all within normal limits. Punch
biopsies of the affected skin were obtained. Histological examination revealed granulomatous
inflammation with associated tattoo ink deposition consistent with foreign body-type
granulomatous reaction ().
Melan A immunostain highlighted scattered single junctional benign melanocytes with control
samples staining appropriately.
The patient was initially treated with topical ocular glucocorticoids without significant
improvement. He then required oral methylprednisolone 24 mg daily, tapered to 4 mg daily
over 6 days. This agent led to rapid resolution of the inflammatory tattoo changes, but not
of the macular and optic disc edema. A sub-tenon’s triamcinolone injection to both eyes
resolved his ocular manifestation; however, tapering of his systemic glucocorticoids caused
his tattoo manifestations to reappear. Adalimumab at 40 mg subcutaneously every other week
satisfactorily terminated all of his symptoms. Unfortunately, after 3 months of therapy,
patient developed an injection site reaction. Certolizumab 200 mg SQ every 2 weeks was
instituted. A follow-up examination 4 months later revealed minimal, if any, subtle
inflammation in both eyes, mild worsening of the macular edema in his left eye, and visual
acuity of 20/20 by Snellen chart.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 63-year-old male patient presented with scrotal erythema of 3 months duration. He had a previous diagnosis of tinea cruris and had employed a combination cream of betamethasone, gentamicin, and clotrimazole for 1 month. He referred erythema, a burning sensation, and warmth.

"An 85-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department of our hospital with coma and shock. She had not visited any hospital previously, had never been examined for complications of diabetes, and had never consumed any medications before. On admission, her vital signs were as follows: consciousness, Glasgow Coma Scale score 3/15 (E1V1M1); blood pressure, 80/40 mm Hg; pulse rate, 130 bpm; and temperature, 37.3°C. Laboratory analysis revealed neutropenia (neutrophils count, 640/µL) and elevated C-reactive protein level to 12.73 mg/dL. The levels of blood glucose and hemoglobin (Hb)A1c were 237 mg/dL and 12.1%, respectively. Blood and urine cultures showed the presence of Escherichia coli. CT of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast revealed diffuse gas collection within the urinary bladder wall (Figures , , ), which is a typical sign of EC caused by gas-forming bacteria., The patient was intensively treated with a broad-spectrum antibiotic meropenem hydrate and a vasopressor, and was put on respirator and catheterized; however, she died within 2 days due to circulatory failure.

"A 35-year-old male reported to Government Dental College, Indore, before 3 years, with a soft, non-tender compressible diffuse swelling involving the left parotid gland for the last 9–10 months. The swelling was noted to have gradually increased in size and was measuring 3.5 cm × 2.5 cm × 4.5 cm at the time of presentation []. It was a well-defined smooth-walled cystic lesion seen in the superficial lobe of the left parotid gland. The patient denied any history of trauma to the parotid area. The overlying skin was normal in color and freely moveable over the mass. The function of facial nerve was normal. There was no associated regional lymphadenopathy or thyroid enlargement. Intraoral examination revealed a free flow of saliva from the left parotid (Stensen's duct) opening.
The preoperative diagnosis of this case remained uncertain as the nature and clinical symptoms resembled the other cystic lesions of the parotid gland such as retention cysts, extravasation cysts, or cystic degenerative salivary gland tumor.
Further investigations were done including orthopantomographic radiograph and lateral skull radiograph however, both revealed normal conditions.
ELISA-based HIV was nonreactive. In addition, the patient did not belong to the HIV high-risk group based on social and family histories Biochemical investigation revealed high protein content A simple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done which showed “A well-defined, thin, smooth-walled cystic lesion within the superficial part of the left parotid gland measuring about 3.7 cm × 2.6 cm × 4.2 cm. The fluid content of the lesion appeared hypertense on T1 as well as T2-weighted imaging (WI), suggestive of high proteinaceous or hemorrhagic content with no solid component. MRI picture was, therefore, indicative of a benign cystic lesion of the left parotid gland with a differential diagnosis of branchial cleft cyst [] Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC): FNA of the mass yielded a chocolate brown, hemorrhagic fluid which on cytological examination revealed sparsely cellular smear consisting of inflammatory infiltrate predominantly with neutrophils, lymphocytes and cystic macrophages against a proteinaceous background suggestive of an infected cyst of the left parotid gland.
Hence, based on clinical presentation, aspiration and MRI, a final diagnosis of infected cyst of the left parotid gland was given.
The finding was explained and the patient agreed for the surgical excision of superficial parotid gland tissue under general anesthesia.
After skin preparation with povidone solution, access to the cyst was made through the lower neck incision at the deepest neck crest which is found to be posteroinferior to the cyst. This helps to minimize the postoperative scarring and avoid from puncturing the cyst. The incision was then extended to the mastoid, posterior and inferior auricles. The incision was then performed layer by layer until it reached the platysma muscle. This muscle was dissected to expose the underneath cyst capsule. Once the plane between cyst capsule and platysma muscle was identified, the blunt dissection was carried out carefully separating the cyst from the sternocleidomastoid muscle posteriorly and the posterior belly of digastric muscle underneath with the preservation of facial nerve. However, the upper part of the cyst was found embedded in the parotid tissue, so part of the superficial lobe of the left parotid gland was excised together with the cyst. The specimen was then sent for histopathological examination (HPE).
Patient recovery was nonincidental with no evidence of facial nerve palsy and wound infection.
The HPE showed a collapsed cyst wall with adjacent salivary gland and small reactive lymphoid tissue. The cyst was lined by thin ciliated columnar epithelium in some areas, cuboidal in other areas and flat squamous cells in still other areas. However, no nuclear atypia was seen. The appearance was that of a Lymphoepithelial cyst (LEC). The lymphoid tissue was of both diffuse and follicular nature [Figures –].","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 60-year-old woman admitted for elective excision of a right thyroid papillary carcinoma. She had complained of hoarseness and aspiration while swallowing for several months. Rigid endoscopy confirmed paramedian vocal cord fixation with large glottic chink. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) detected a solid thyroid mass invading the perithyroid tissue with suspicion of right tracheoesophageal groove invasion. Total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection was carried out via transcervical incision. Intraoperatively, the tumor was found to invade the right recurrent laryngeal nerve and along the right tracheoesophageal groove (). The right recurrent laryngeal nerve was sacrificed and the tumor invading the tracheoesophageal groove was shaved off the trachea and esophagus. After tracheal shaving, a small perforation (0.5×0.5 cm) was noticed in the posterior membranous portion of first tracheal ring (). The pleura of the lung and mediastinum were intact. The perforation was repaired primarily with No. 4-0 Vicryl suture and reinforced with Surgicel® and tissue glue. The trachea did not leak by underwater testing during positive anesthetic ventilation and the operation was completed.
One day after surgery, the patient developed dyspnea, cervical emphysema, and ecchymosis over the neck after an episode of vigorous coughing. With the impression of a postoperative hematoma an emergency neck exploration was performed under general anesthesia. A small hematoma was found beneath the platysma and strap muscles, No obvious bleeding point was evident and the reconstructed trachea portion was relatively intact. Postoperatively, while still in the recovery room, the patient showed signs of acute respiratory failure. A chest radiograph revealed bilateral pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and massive subcutaneous emphysema (). Her dyspnea and cyanosis were relieved after an emergency chest tube was inserted. Over the next week, the pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax resolved gradually. The patient discharged without any problems.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"NK is a Caucasian female, 15 years old, in ninth grade at presentation, with mild intellectual disability (ID), (intellectual quotient [IQ] =55–69), atrioventricular canal repair at age 6 months, and no previous psychiatric history. She presented with a 6-month history of gradual development of slow motor activity, reduced speech with increased latency, unusual movements such as repetitive movements and posturing, blunted and inappropriate affect, mood lability, sleep disturbance, slow eating, and a general decline in previously attained skills, all of which supported the catatonia diagnosis. Family history was significant for maternal anxiety. Previous medical work-up included brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalograms (EEGs), computed tomography scan of sinuses, thyroid function tests, and polysomnogram to rule out sleep apnea, all with normal findings. The only exceptions were evidence of previous Mycoplasma and Epstein–Barr virus infections. Recent stressors included transition to high school and the death of a grandmother a year earlier.
At presentation, she had received low-dose clonazepam for 1 month with some improvement in symptoms. Previous medication trials included ethosuximide for 2 weeks (no effect); a trial of lisdexamfetamine (resulted in agitation, mood and sleep dysregulation, and possible hallucinations); and citalopram 20 mg, which may have led to further decline in ADL. Based on this presentation, NK was diagnosed with unspecified catatonia. Treatment with lorazepam 1.5 mg three times daily was initiated, and gradually titrated to a total dosage of 12 mg daily with some improvement in functioning. However, psychomotor slowing and mood lability persisted and was impairing. She was therefore hospitalized and started on ECT; lorazepam was continued and citalopram discontinued. She responded well to ECT and continued a tapering course of ECT, ending having had a total of 26 treatments. During this time, she was also started on lithium carbonate and amiloride 5 mg for renal protection. When her symptoms recurred 3 months later, she received a second course of 21 bilateral ECT over 7 months with 100% recovery.
She continues to receive maintenance ECT at 2-week intervals, primarily to control motor symptoms, and has received a total of 73 treatments over the past 31 months. Lithium was discontinued due to lack of response and side effects (polyuria and weight gain).","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 65-year-old woman had been diagnosed with overlap syndrome (autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis) for 14 years. Initially, she was prescribed ursodeoxycholic acid and prednisone, and refused immunosuppressive drugs. However, due to the presence of gastric ulcer and economic reasons, she stopped taking these medications. When liver test results were abnormal, she would take compound glycyrrhizin tablets to treat the disease. In September 2013, due to hematemesis and melena, rupture and hemorrhage of the esophagofundal varices was found. Computed tomography revealed cirrhosis of the liver, splenomegaly, and ascites. The disease progressed to Child–Pugh C decompensated cirrhosis. The patient received endoscopic therapy, and began taking prescribed ursodeoxycholic acid 750 mg daily. From September 2013 to August 2015, her alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level fluctuated between 27 and 91 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase between 33 and 94 U/L, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase between 73 and 240 U/L, alkaline phosphatase between 130 and 260 U/L, total bilirubin (TBIL) between 39.3 and 74.05 mol/L, direct bilirubin between 17.6 and 34.24 mol/L, albumin between 30 and 35 g/L, antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer between 1:1000 and 1:3200, and antimitochondrial II antibody (AMA-M2) between (+) and (++). In September 2015, the patient consulted her physician in our department for significant jaundice and weakness. Physical examination revealed yellow pigmentation of the skin and sclerae, positive liver palms, spider angioma on the chest, and positive shifting dullness. Results of liver function tests showed the following: ALT, 499.9 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 686.8 U/L; albumin, 27.02 g/L; γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, 87.2 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 225.6 U/L; TBIL, 329.6 mol/L; direct bilirubin, 272.91 mol/L; cholinesterase, 2156.4 U/L; prothrombin time, 17.7 seconds; percentage prothrombin time activity, 60; and platelet count, 45 × 109/L. The anti-HCV antibody test result was positive and the quantitative HCV RNA test result was 6.1 × 105 IU/mL (genotype 1). The ANA titer was 1:3200, and the AMA-M2 was (+). Epigastric enhanced magnetic resonance imaging identified cirrhosis, splenomegaly, ascites, and collateral circulation in the esophagus, fundus of the stomach, and splenic hilum. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography did not detect any abnormality in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. Initially, the treatment included ursodeoxycholic acid at the previous dosage, glycyrrhizinate, human serum albumin, furosemide, spironolactone, lactulose oral solution, and platelet and clotting factor transfusion. However, after 1 week, weakness and jaundice were exacerbated. Liver function test results were significantly abnormal with a TBIL of 417.6 mol/L, prothrombin time of 23.5 seconds, percentage prothrombin time activity of 46, albumin of 23.1 g/L, cholinesterase of 1789.7 U/L, and platelet count of 14 × 109/L. After ruling out other possible causes of acute hepatitis, we thought that the cause of the acute exacerbation of hepatic damage was AHC infection, as liver function was decreased by HCV activity. After discussing the risks and benefits with the patient, we started her on an IFN-free combination therapy of SOF and weight-based RBV for 12 weeks. Gilead-brand SOF (400 mg/d) was used. SOF cannot be bought in China; the patient acquired the medication through her relative who works abroad. The patient was reviewed at treatment weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12 and at posttreatment weeks 4, 12, 24, and 36. At the beginning of SOF and RBV treatment, the HCV RNA viral load was 4.8 × 106 IU/mL. At week 1, the HCV RNA viral load was reduced to 4330 IU/mL; at week 2, 1790 IU/mL; and at week 3, 750 IU/mL. At weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 48 (posttreatment week 36), the HCV viral load was undetectable (Fig. ). By week 4, the patient's symptoms alleviated. By week 8, liver function returned to baseline levels with TBIL of 85.35 mol/L, prothrombin time of 17.0 seconds, albumin of 29.5 g/L, and platelet count of 53.2 × 109/L (Fig. ).","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 12-year-old boy with a large retroperitoneal sarcoma with bilateral obstructive uropathy was planned for bilateral ureteric stenting. His preoperative serum creatinine was raised and coagulation parameters were normal. Cystoscopy showed a deformed bladder with severe bullous edema of the trigone. Both the ureteric orifices could not be identified on cystoscopy; hence, a decision of antegrade ureteral stenting was taken. Based on the preoperative plain computed tomography (CT) scan determined landmark of the renal pelvis, a Chiba-needle puncture was made 5 cm lateral to the midline at the level of the third lumbar vertebra. Once the right pelvicalyceal system was opacified, mid calyceal puncture was made using an 18G three-part percutaneous access needle (Surgimedik Healthcare India Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai, India). Guidewire could be negotiated into the bladder, and antegrade double-J stent was placed. A similar procedure was performed on the left side. The procedure was uneventful.
Postprocedure, the patient had a progressively increasing abdominal distension, right flank pain, and hypotension. Bedside ultrasonography indicated a large right perirenal hematoma. Contrast-enhanced CT scan confirmed the hematoma [] and demonstrated active contrast leak from the right lumbar artery during the arteriography phase of the CT scan. Renal vessels appeared normal. In view of the dropping blood pressure and hemoglobin levels, a decision of angioembolization was taken.
Transfemoral aortography and renal angiography were performed. Renal vasculature was normal. Selective catheterization of the second right lumbar artery confirmed the extravasation of contrast solution from the middle part of the anterior branch of lumbar artery. The bleeding vessel was embolized using polyvinyl alcohol particles (Boston Scientific Target Therapeutics, California, USA). Posttranscatheter embolization, the pain reduced and blood pressure stabilized.

"A 33-year-old woman, with severe postburn mentosternal contracture and cicatricial carcinoma, presented for skin grafting surgery in our hospital. The burn occurred when she was 4-year-old. She underwent two reconstructive procedures at 7 and 14 years in local medical centers. Due to the pain caused by the occurrence of cicatricial carcinoma, affecting eating and speaking, she had tried several medical centers for treatment in the past year, but failed for unsuccessful ATI. In preoperative physical examination, severe scar contractures and large tumor of approximately 15 × 12 cm were observed on the lower lip, neck, and anterior chest (Figure ); the chin, chest, and bilateral armpits fused together; the cervicomental and mentosternal angles completely obliterated; the anterior neck structures, including the larynx, the trachea, and the carotid arteries, were unidentifiable or impalpable. Mouth opening was limited (15 mm) and Mallampati test could not be performed. The left nostril was obstructive for stenosis, but the right nostril breathing was smooth. Preoperative X-rays and a computed tomography scan (data not shown) revealed distortion of the upper airway and no stenosis of the trachea. It was difficult to perform face mask ventilation because of the nearly fixed neck and regressed mandible.
According to the guidelines on the management of difficult airway, awake flexible bronchoscopic intubation with topicalization is preferred in such patients, but the patient rejected ATI for discomfort and nociceptive recall before. Meanwhile, other awake strategies, including lightwand, GlideScopeⓇ Video laryngoscope, laryngeal mask airway, oral or nasal blind intubation, retrograde intubation, surgical tracheostomy, seem impossible. Therefore, a flexible bronchoscopic intubation protocol under precise sedation, topicalization, and spontaneous respiration preservation seems a promising strategy, but the airway should be secured for there was no definite backup plan.
A written informed consent was taken with explanation focused on the risks of difficult airway. Atropine 0.5 mg was intramuscular injected to reduce secretion 30 min before transferring to the operating room. The patient was monitored by respiration rate, ventilation volume, pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram, blood pressure and bispectral index (BIS), and preoxygenated once she arrived in the operation room. Vital signs were stable. A pillow and some folded sheets were stuffed between the patient back and the operating bed to make her feel comfortable. Intravenous midazolam 2 mg and sufentanil 5 μg were given. Nasal passage was anesthetized by pledgets with 2% lidocaine and 0.25% phenylephrine. Sevoflurane 2% with a flow rate of 4 L/min with 100% O2 was administered via an endoscopic mask connected to the ventilator circuit. The concentration of sevoflurane was gradually increased to 4% and stopped when the BIS reached 55–60 within 3 min, then airway reassessment and precise topicalization were achieved by a modified SAYGO technique., , An epidural catheter (Figure ), with an outer diameter of 3.8 mm, was fixed and 1.5 cm longer was applied at the end of the fiberscope (MDH A10; Zhuhai Mindhao Medical Technology Co., Ltd., ShenZhen, China). Topicalization was achieved by spraying 2% lidocaine (7 ml) via the catheter onto the posterior nasal canal, pharyngeal cavity, epiglottis, glottis, and tracheal (Figure ). Meanwhile, supplemental oxygen 10 L/min was delivered by a hose (Figure ) through the mouth to avoid hypoxemia. When lidocaine worked, about 5 minutes later, sevoflurane was inhaled again until the BIS reached 55–60. Then, a Parker Flex-Tip® tube with an inner diameter of 6.0 mm (Lead Medical Instrument Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China), which was heated by 40 ℃ and lubricated in advance, was successfully and smoothly inserted into the trachea from the direction of flexible bronchoscopy (Figure ). No stress reactions, including cough, hypertension, tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypoxia, and bronchospasm, and no intubation related complications, such as airway trauma, airway obstruction, and bleeding, were occurred during intubation. Finally, the patient was very satisfied with this experience after emergence.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 49-year-old and otherwise healthy man underwent a traffic accident and was transferred to emergency room in an unconscious state. Brain computed tomography (CT) revealed traumatic subdural and epidural hemorrhage at the bilateral frontal lobes and right temporal lobe. No abnormality in the extrapyramidal motor system including the basal ganglia was present (). The initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 5 (eye opening response [E]=1, verbal response [V]=0, motor response [M]=4). After receiving burr-hole trephination and hematoma drainage, the patient was reevaluated to have a GCS score of 11 (E1, V5, M5). Although verbal and motor responses improved after surgery, he was unable to open his eyes even with a strong painful stimulus. In spite of gradual recovery of mental status and motor function, voluntary eye opening was still not observed. After being transferred to the rehabilitation unit, the patient was examined for the neurological function with mental status being alert and the Mini-Mental State Examination score at 7. He exhibited left side weakness that was graded fair to good in a manual muscle test. The pupils were 3 mm in diameter, symmetrical, and equally reactive with extraocular movements fully intact. With the patient unable to open his eyes on command, an examiner elevated the patient's eyelid and found no abnormality in the ocular motor function. No evidence of other apraxia, such as buccofacial and limb apraxia, was present. He received comprehensive rehabilitation treatment, but AEO did not improve. We planned on treating the patient with levodopa/benserazide 200/50 mg twice a day with the informed consent of the patient. On the fifth day of the treatment, he started to open his eyes on command intermittently (). We confirmed no visual loss since he was able to recognize color and count fingers during spontaneous eye opening. With continued treatment, the interval between command and eye opening gradually shortened while the duration of spontaneous eye opening increased. This result was even more apparent when eating and undergoing physical training. We presumed that the dopaminergic treatment had a beneficial effect on AEO and tried to increase dose frequency from twice to three times daily to investigate a dose-dependent response. However, in the third day of the dosage modulation, aggressive behaviors emerged, and the treatment was withheld for three days. Even though the aggressiveness subsided shortly thereafter, the patient again exhibited difficulty in voluntary eye opening. After the resolution of the behavioral problem, the treatment was resumed twice a day. With AEO ameliorated, as evident in spontaneous eye opening during eating and physical training, the patient was discharged and has been closely followed up on an outpatient basis with the treatment of levodopa/benserazide 200/50 mg twice a day. He is currently capable of voluntary eye opening that is sustained much longer than before being discharged.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 37-year-old man was admitted to local hospital with weight loss, night sweat,
repeating fever for a week in April 2018. The patient’s initial laboratory
examination showed that leukocyte count was 12.48×109/L with 37%
eosinophilia in the peripheral blood, hemoglobin concentration was 127 g/L and
platelet count was 146×109/L. The initial bone marrow (BM)
aspirates and biopsy showed hyper leukocytes and significantly increased eosinophils
(8%), and neutrophil alkaline phosphatase score was 18 ( and ). Above all, these inspections were consistent with a diagnosis of
MPN. Then the patient was administrated with 20 mg prednisone per day, but it showed
no any effect with white blood cell (WBC) 15.1×109/L, hemoglobin
108 g/L, platelet 114×109/L, eosinophils
5.13×109/L (33.91%) in peripheral blood.
The suite of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay on the
BM aspirate was used to detect BCR-ABL,
PDGFRA, PDGFRB, and FGFR1
rearrangement. MPN FISH assay showed PDGFRB arrangement positive.
The karyotype analysis of BM cells showed 46,XY[20].
Patient’s RNA was extracted from BM cell by Trizol methods according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) for RNA-sequencing
(RNA-seq) in July 2018. RNA quality and concentration were estimated by Nano Drop
ND-2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Paired-end reads were generated
from the complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries using an Illumina Next Seq 550
instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Then we used star-fusion software to analyze
the RNA-seq raw data [] (). Standard
settings were applied for all three tools and reads were aligned to the Genome
Reference Consortium Human Build 37 (GRCh37). RNA-seq revealed that
PDGFRB fused with CSNK2A1 gene. To confirm the
fusion, reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was
performed with CSNK2A1-PDGFRB forward primer:
5′-GTGCCAAGCAGGGCCAGAGT-3′, reverse primer
5′-AGGGTGCGTCCCAGCACAAG-3′. The reciprocal
PDGFRB-CSNK2A1 fusion forward primer:
5′-TCAGAGCTGACACTGGTTCG-3′, reverse primer:
5′-GATGTTGGGACCTCCTCTCAA-3′. The PCR products was purified with PCR
purification kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) and sequenced by GENEWIZ Biotechnology
Co., Ltd. (Suzhou, Jiangsu, China). The sequence was analyzed using the BLAST
program ().
Given the existence of PDGFRB fusion, he received imatinib therapy with 200 mg every
day orally in September 2018. Two months later, the laboratory examination showed
that WBC was 6.14×109/L with 2.8% eosinophilia in the peripheral
blood (). Finally, real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR was
performed to quantify the fusion gene and showed negative in 8 months after imatinib
treatment. To date, the patient acquired sustained molecular complete remission for
2 years until the last follow-up.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 25-year-old male presented at our clinics for a right shoulder pain related to a dorsal scapular mass first observed 4 months earlier. The main symptom was a shoulder discomfort when lying on his back, sometimes compromising the sleep. The patient also complained of some weakness when using his right arm under the shoulder level. The medical history consisted in a unique kidney and past treatments for a nodular sclerosis-subtype Hodgkin lymphoma (chemotherapy and radiotherapy, last treatment twelve years ago and no recurrence).
The physical examination revealed a nonmobile 3 cm T × 3 cm AP × 2 cm CC hard mass on the posterior superomedial angle of the right scapula, sensitive to palpation (). Muscle trophicity was symmetrical. The right shoulder presented a full range of motion in all directions without scapulothoracic dyskinesis. Weakness and pain were observed when raising the right shoulder or during active abduction (at all levels).
A right shoulder radiological series including AP, lateral, and Neer views was described normal and conducted additional investigations. A thoracic computed tomography was performed and described a 2.6 cm T × 2.6 cm AP × 2.2 cm CC solid bone mass at the posterior aspect of the superomedial angle of the scapula. The diagnosis of an osteochondroma without signs of malignancy was stated (). No adenopathy or recurrence of the past Hodgkin lymphoma was observed. Retrospectively, the mass was apparent on the shoulder Neer view. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including the right shoulder and scapula confirmed the benign character of the osteochondroma. The accessory nerve (XI) was compressed between the osteochondroma and the deep layer of the trapezius; no muscle atrophy was described ().
The osteochondroma was surgically removed under general anesthesia. The patient was prone, and a 10 cm incision was centered on the mass. The trapezius muscle was split at its superior part at the level of the scapula spine. The accessory nerve was visualized and protected in the deep layer of the trapezius muscle. The osteochondroma was exposed and resected from the supraspinatous fossa with an osteotome. The mass was perfectly smooth and measured 3 cm T × 3 cm AP × 2 cm CC (). The integrity of the accessory nerve was checked before closure. The histopathologic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of a benign osteochondroma ().
The shoulder was immobilized in a sling 10 days for wound care. Free mobilization was then granted. No physiotherapy was needed.
The patient was followed annually up to 3 years. He regained full shoulder range of motion and complete symmetric trapezius and rotator cuff strength. The patient has no clinical and radiological recurrence of the osteochondroma.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"In 2008, a 69-year-old man was diagnosed with a nonmetastatic Fuhrman grade 3 left RCC. A radical left nephrectomy was performed, and the patient was monitored for 2 years without any other medical complications. No renal failure or electrolyte disorders were reported. In 2010, a metastatic progression was suspected on a systematic computed tomography scan, with lateral aortic nodes involvement and a left renal fossa tumor extended to the left colon and diaphragm. Sunitinib was initiated at 37.5 mg/day after biopsies confirmed a histology-proven metastatic RCC recurrence. The patient was treated with a 28-day on and 14-day off schedule. Plasma uric acid was normal at baseline. During the first cycle of this treatment, the patient presented his very first episode of gout attack located on a big toe. As it was reported to be normal in 30% of acute gout attacks if assessed immediately, the plasma uric acid concentration was assessed 15 days later, which was 81 mg/L (normal plasma uric acid concentration <70 mg/L). No concomitant renal failure, hemoglobin and/or hematocrit disorder, or concurrent medication intake other than sunitinib (acetylsalicylic acid, diuretics, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, etc.) were reported. Purine-rich food and alcohol were cutoff, but the patient did not consume much of them. Allopurinol (100 mg/day) was initiated before the second cycle of sunitinib without colchicine because interactions with sunitinib were feared. Two months later, during the fourth sunitinib cycle, the patient developed a similar acute gout attack without any identified triggering factor. Allopurinol dose was increased to maximum (300 mg/day), while sunitinib was maintained at 37.5 mg/day until progression. The patient kept sticking to his purine-depleted diet. Iterative gout attacks of lower intensity were still periodically reported during the following months under sunitinib therapy. After progression, a new line of treatment was initiated. Sunitinib discontinuation was followed by a total regression of gout attacks.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"This is a 57-year-old male patient from eastern Morocco, followed up for 10 years for ankylosing spondylitis and admitted to the emergency room for an occlusive syndrome and abdominal pain. The symptomatology goes back two years with the onset of intermittent postprandial abdominal pain in the right iliac fossa which worsened on the day of his admission to the hospital. The clinical examination of our patient revealed tenderness in the right iliac fossa with palpation of a mobile mass measuring about 4 cm and free hernial orifices. The standard biological assessment carried out in the emergency room had objectified an inflammatory syndrome with a CRP increased to 60 mg/L and the CT scan had objectified a cockade image next to the last ileal handle. This image, which is probably related to an ileo-ileal invagination, is also the site of a circumferential thickening, regular symmetrical, measuring 14 mm in maximum thickness with respect for the adjacent fat and without individualization of peri-lesional lymphadenopathy (Figure ).
After multidisciplinary discussion and discussion with the patient, we opted for surgical exploration performed under general anesthesia which had demonstrated an intussusception 50 cm from the last intestinal loop on an intraluminal process with mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Bowel resection with lymphadenectomy involving intussusception with manual anastomosis was performed (Figures , ).
The pathological study noted the presence of an inflammatory pseudo-polyp integrating into chronic inflammatory bowel disease Crohn's type (Figures , ). The patient's postoperative progress course was uneventful, our patient was satisfied with the overall care and the discharge was carried out for five days under specific medical treatment for Crohn's disease. Follow-up after two years was without abnormalities with control of rheumatological and digestive manifestations.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 54-year-old Chinese man of Han nationality, a retiree, went to a local hospital because of hematuria. He had an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showing right renal mass and bilateral adrenal nodules. He was referred to our hospital for further examination and treatment. He denied any medical history, except for a 4-year history of hypertension. He took 5 mg amlodipine besylate every day. He was married and living with his family; he had smoked tobacco for 30 years and denied alcohol consumption. Members of his family had no history of endocrine diseases or malignant tumors.
At the time of admission, his temperature was 37 °C, the pulse was 80 per minute, and his blood pressure was 161/75 mmHg. His height was 168 cm and weight 64 kg. There was no physical sign of Cushing’s syndrome, such as central obesity, skin atrophy, buffalo hump, red striae of skin, or moon face. The results of his cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological examinations were all unremarkable. A laboratory examination (Table ) showed an electrolyte disturbance, in particular, a very low serum potassium level. His 24-hour urinary free cortisol was elevated. The function of his thyroid gland, parathyroid hormone, metanephrine, and normetanephrine were in normal range.
The endocrine findings (Table ) showed high plasma aldosterone level and low plasma renin concentration. He then underwent a captopril challenge test which did not show suppressed level of plasma aldosterone concentration. A diagnosis of PA was of no doubt. On the other hand, the circadian rhythm of cortisol disappeared, and his serum cortisol level was not suppressed by an overnight dexamethasone suppression test (ODST) and low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST). He was diagnosed as having SCS.
An abdominal CT scan revealed a mass in the parenchyma of his right kidney (Figs. and ) and there was a rounded, low-density mass in his right adrenal gland and a rounded, low-density mass in his left adrenal gland (Figs. , , , and ); the larger adrenal mass was approximately 2.6 cm × 2.3 cm on the left adrenal gland. These findings indicated the possibility of a renal tumor and bilateral adrenocortical adenomas.
Sequential adrenal venous sampling (AVS) without adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation was performed next. The result of AVS (Table ) reminded us that the right adrenal gland was responsible for aldosterone hypersecretion, and, quite possibly, the left was responsible for hypercortisolism.
Right nephrectomy and right partial adrenalectomy were performed first. The golden-yellow nodule in the right adrenal was approximately 2.5 cm × 2 cm × 0.8 cm macroscopically. The pathological diagnosis of the right adrenal nodule was adrenocortical adenoma. The right kidney tumor was proven to be a fibroma. Three days after operation, our patient’s serum potassium was 4.5 mmol/L without any supplementary treatment. The hypertensive drug was changed to 2 mg terazosin every day.
A laparoscopic left partial adrenalectomy was conducted 1 month later. When admitted to hospital, his blood pressure was 127/83 mmHg controlled by 2 mg terazosin every day, and his level of potassium was 4.9 mmol/L without any supplementary treatment. We examined his cortisol at 8 a.m. before operation, which was 344.81 nmol/L. The operation was successful and the level of cortisol at 8 a.m. had reduced to 192.01 nmol/L 2 days after operation. The nodule in the left adrenal was golden-yellow; it was approximately 3 cm × 2.5 cm × 2 cm. The pathological diagnosis of the left adrenal gland nodule was proven to be adrenocortical adenoma. After the second operation, doctors advised 30 mg hydrocortisone should be taken once a day with a weekly reduction of 10 mg until withdrawal, and 2 mg terazosin should be taken once a day.
During postoperative follow-up, terazosin was gradually stopped, and blood pressure and serum potassium remained normal. Approximately 2 months later, his ACTH concentration was 98.73 pg/ml which was above the reference value. This meant our patient had adrenocortical insufficiency, and he continued to take hydrocortisone. Months later, hydrocortisone was stopped, the concentration of cortisol and ACTH were 233.46 nmol/L and 49.43 pg/ml, respectively. The plasma aldosterone concentration was 104 pg/ml and plasma renin concentration was 3.1 uIU/ml. Normalization of aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR), cortisol, and ACTH were reached and our patient did not complain of any discomfort.
Immunohistochemistry (Fig. ) of the two adrenal nodules revealed that the right one had positive immunostaining for CYP11B2, which is essential to synthesize aldosterone, and the left one had positive immunostaining for CYP11B1, which is essential to synthesize cortisol. These results confirmed the right nodule was responsible for the secretion of aldosterone and the left nodule was responsible for the secretion of cortisol. Somatic KCNJ5 mutation (Leu168Arg) was found in the right adrenal tumor (Fig. ), and there was no KCNJ5 mutation in the left adrenal tumor.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A 44-year-old, right-handed female presented with sudden hand motor deficits in her left hand. There was no trauma to the arm, she used no medications and she had no vascular risk factors.
Examination revealed severe motor deficits of the left hand with extension of the three ulnar fingers and wrist, muscle atrophy in the first dorsal interosseous muscle, and claw hand deformity without sensory deficits (Fig. ). According to the Medical Research Council scale examination revealed grade 1 in the left wrist flexor, grade 4 in the left wrist extensor, grade 3 in the left fingers flexor and grade 4 in the left fingers extensor. Adduction and abduction of the left fingers were also severely impaired (grade 3). Deep tendon reflexes were mildly brisker ipsilateral to the affected hand. No Babinski sign was observed.
Cervical computed tomography (CT) was unremarkable. Peripheral motor nerve conduction velocities were normal. Small, discrete ischemic lesions appeared hyperintense on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence (upper arrows on Fig. ). The infarct was located in the right posterior part of the precentral hand knob area (upper arrow on 1d), near the central sulcus (lower arrow on Fig. ). CT angiography showed significant stenosis in the right proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) trunk.
Transesophageal echocardiogram and carotid ultrasound did not suggest an embolic source. Hypercoagulable screening and levels of markers specific to systemic vasculitis were all normal. An embolism arising from the ipsilateral MCA stenosis was subsequently considered as the etiology of the patient’s symptoms, and she received acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel for secondary stroke prevention.
At the 2-month follow-up, the patient complained of fatigue and progressive headaches. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. Follow-up 3-Tesla MRI with gadolinium contrast revealed focal wall enhancement in the right proximal MCA (Fig. ), indicating cerebral angiitis. Multiple stenoses at the same location were seen on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) (Fig. ). Brain biopsy was not performed.
Cyclophosphamide infusions were administered with glucocorticoids over the subsequent 15 weeks. Left-hand motor function improved, aside from her left fifth finger.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 65-year-old Caucasian woman presented in March 2007 with a 3-month history of painless left-sided cervical lymphadenopathy. She denied any associated fevers, chills, loss of weight, dyspnea, dysphagia, or any other symptoms. The patient's surgical history was pertinent for a completely resected stage IA melanoma over the left shoulder 16 years before this presentation. Physical exam revealed enlarged and non-tender cervical and axillary lymph nodes without splenomegaly. A skin survey did not reveal any new nevi or concerning lesions. A complete blood picture showed a white blood cell count of 14.7 × 103/μL, an absolute lymphocyte count of 7.35 × 103/μL, hemoglobin of 13.8 g/dL, a platelet count of 258 × 103/μL, and lactate dehydrogenase of 291 U/L. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood demonstrated a monoclonal lymphocyte population expressing CD5, CD19, CD20, CD24, CD43, and CD52 with lambda light chain restriction and no increase in CD34-positive blasts. The cells were negative for CD38 and ZAP-70. Based on the above findings, the patient was diagnosed with Rai Stage I CLL and placed under observation.
Two years after her initial diagnosis, the patient presented with progressive dyspnea, associated with pleuritic chest pain and a 20 lbs weight loss over a period of 3 months. Physical examination revealed increased axillary and cervical lymphadenopathy and decreased breath sounds over the right lung. Chest X-ray revealed a large right-sided pleural effusion (Fig. ). White blood cell count was noted to be 53.4 × 103/μL, and she had an absolute lymphocyte count of 40.7 × 103/μL. The pleural fluid analysis was consistent with an exudative effusion, with increased atypical lymphocytes. Flow cytometry demonstrated a 12% clonal population consistent with the pleural involvement of CLL. The majority of the lymphocytes were CD4+ T-lymphocytes (CD4:CD8 in a ratio of 15: 1), but polymerase chain reaction failed to show any clonal T-cell receptor-γ or T-cell receptor-β gene rearrangements.
Secondary to rapid reaccumulation of pleural fluid, increasing lymphadenopathy, and rapid doubling time of lymphocyte count, the decision to treat symptomatic CLL was made. Chemotherapy with pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab did not result in any meaningful clinical response. As the patient's pleural effusion was refractory to CLL treatment, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was performed, which demonstrated diffuse nodular thickening of both visceral and parietal layers of the pleura (Fig. ). A biopsy of these lesions revealed enlarged cells with an increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and pleomorphic nuclei with occasional cherry red nucleoli (Fig. ). Immunohistochemistry studies demonstrated positive staining with HMB-45 (Fig. ) and S-100 protein. Electron microscopy revealed type II melanosomes with cross-striated lattice in an enclosed membrane (Fig. ), type III melanosomes with increased deposition of electron-dense melanin, and type IV melanosomes with highly electron-dense melanin (Fig. ). Based on the above findings, a diagnosis of malignant melanoma was made. Computed tomography of the chest revealed extensive lobulated tumor lining the entirety of the right parietal pleural surface without any evidence of parenchymal involvement. The patient's medical condition rapidly declined, and she ultimately succumbed to death before initiation of any therapy.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 72 year-old man developed right side weakness after a left ACA infarction and was transferred to the department of rehabilitation medicine 7 weeks after the attack. He had no remarkable medical history but was diagnosed with diabetes at our hospital. He had a family history of ischemic stroke (affecting his younger brother). On transfer to our department, he was alert but had cognitive impairment with a K-MMSE (Korean version of the Mini-Mental Status Examination) score of 13. Manual muscle test (MMT) grades of his right upper extremity-were all 3/5, lower extremity test grades were 2/5 except for ankle plantar flexor grades of 1/5, and dorsiflexor grades were 0/5. He had no spasticity in his elbow and knee joints, and had a modified Ashworth scale (MAS) score of zero. His sensory function was intact and deep tendon reflex was normoactive. He complained that his hand moved abnormally against his will. He could grasp and release with his bare hands on the doctor's order, but when grasping some objects with his palm, he was unable to release them. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed acute cerebral infarction at the left ACA region (). For TMS, we used a Magstim 200 monopulse® (Magstim co., Whiteland, UK) connected to a figure-eight coil (7 cm outer diameter for each loop) with a maximum magnetic strength of 2.0 tesla. The coil was initially centered on the vertex, perpendicular to the scalp, with the handle pointing posteriorly at a 45 degree angle from the median sagittal line and then moved in 1 cm steps in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle with a surface gel electrode. The active electrode was placed over the muscle belly and the reference electrode over the distal interphalangeal joint of the index finger. The signals were displayed by Keypoint® EMG (Dantec, Skovlunde, Denmark) and stored in a laboratory computer. Using a paired pulse magnetic stimulation technique, we studied intracortical inhibition (ICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF). In this case, when we stimulated the left motor cortex area, the resting motor threshold (rMT) was 54% of the maximum magnetic strength and the MEP amplitude was 287 µV. At the right motor cortex area, the rMT was 57% and the MEP amplitude was 579 µV. In the ICF study, when we stimulated the left motor cortex area, the MEP amplitude was increased to 1,697 µV. In the ICI study, the amplitude was not suppressed, but rather increased to 1,170 µV ().

"Patient (8): is a 6 year old boy, the brother of patient (7). His height was 110 cm (< 4SD), his weight was 11.5 Kg (< 4SD) and skull circumference was 44 cm. He had the same characteristic physical features of his older sister with cataract and cerebellar ataxia. Abdominal examination revealed enlarged liver (palpable 4 cm below the costal margin). His chest and heart examination were clinically free.
Abdominal ultrasound showed mildly enlarged liver with normal spleen. ALT was 135 IU/L (normal = 40), AST was 126 IU/L (normal = 37) and GGT was 85 U/L (normal = 50). Nerve conduction velocity showed axonal neuropathic disease and audiometery showed moderate sensorineural hearing loss.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 47-year-old woman presented with 2 days' history of right facial weakness and pain in the right periauricular area. Two months earlier she had had acute-onset deafness on the right side. The general physical examination was unremarkable. Neurological examination showed right lower motor neuron facial palsy and reduced taste sensation on the right half of the tongue. Hearing was reduced on the right side and the Rinne test and Weber test were suggestive of sensory neural hearing loss (SNHL).
Although the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 105 mm/h, other routine laboratory investigations were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed mild diffuse thickening and gadolinium enhancement of the duramater in the falx cerebri and cerebellar tentorium. Furthermore, an intensely enhancing, enlarged pituitary gland was also noted [Figures and ]. An audiogram revealed moderate right SNHL.
Review of the patient's medical history showed that she had had complaints of a dry sensation of the mouth, burning eyes, and polyarthralgias for the past 2 years. Rheumatoid factor was positive at a titer of 53 IU/ml (normal: <15) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) was positive at a titer of 1.10 by the enzyme immunoassay technique (normal: <0.7). Antibodies to SS-A and SS-B were also strongly positive. Anti-ds DNA and antibodies to Sm, RNP, and Scl-70 were negative. Serum immune electrophoresis revealed no monoclonal gammopathy. Schirmer test showed decreased lacrimation and a lower labial biopsy showed significant lymphocytic infiltration []; these findings were consistent with the diagnosis of Sjögren syndrome (SS). Nerve conduction study revealed bilateral mild carpal tunnel syndrome and right facial neuropathy. Additionally, a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) study showed normal protein and sugar and a cell count of 5 cells/mm3 (all lymphocytes). Gram's staining and AFB staining of the CSF was normal and the VDRL test was negative. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) level was also normal. In view of the pituitary gland infiltration, an endocrine workup was done. Thyroid function test, serum cortisol and ACTH levels, and the water deprivation test for diabetes insipidus were all normal; serum prolactin was mildly raised at 37.6 ng/ml (normal: 2-25 ng/ml). Based on these findings, we diagnosed primary SS, with probable lymphocytic CNS involvement. The patient was treated with IV methylprednisolone pulse therapy, with 1 g/day for three successive days, followed by 0.5 mg/kg/day oral prednisolone, with gradual tapering of the dose. Later, weekly methotrexate at a dose of 10 mg/week was added. Follow-up brain MRI after 6 months of treatment showed a minimal decrease in the pituitary gland enlargement and the meningeal thickening []. The patient's symptoms, except for the dryness of the mouth, resolved with treatment. Over the next 1 year, she had three episodes of transient diplopia due to lateral rectus palsy. She recovered from all these attacks within a few weeks after the dose of steroids was increased. Two years after the first evaluation, she was readmitted with acute-onset dysphagia, nasal regurgitation, and hoarseness of voice. On examination, she was found to have right IXth, Xth, and XIIth cranial nerve palsies, without any long tract signs or cerebellar signs. Repeat MRI did not reveal any fresh brainstem lesions. She was treated with a 3-day course of methylprednisolone injection (1 g/day) and recovered completely in 2 weeks' time.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 57-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with chest pain followed by loss of consciousness. It was stated that loss of consciousness was not related to the patient’s position, and according to the eyewitness’ statement, the patient’s eyes were open at that time. Episodes lasted for approximately 2–3 min. During the episode, fecal and urinary incontinence, tongue-biting, and tonic–clonic seizures were not observed. The medical history revealed that the patient was taking 5 mg amlodipine and 50 mg metoprolol succinate due to hypertension; there was no history of alcohol or cigarette consumption. The patient was then hospitalized and admitted to the cardiology department. Sinus bradycardia (45/min) was detected on electrocardiogram (ECG) at admission, and the patient’s blood pressure was 165/63 mmHg. Then, beta blocker treatment was stopped. There were also no electrolyte disturbances on admission. No other pathology except sinus bradycardia was detected during 24-h ambulatory rhythm monitoring. On the third day of hospitalization, ST segment elevation at DII-DIII as well as aVF derivations and complete atrioventricular (AV) block were detected on ECG (). Emergency coronary angiography was performed, and diffuse spasm was detected at the left anterior descending, circumflex, and right coronary arteries (). After intracoronary administration of 300 mcg nitrate, vasospasm disappeared and ST elevation and AV block regressed (Figs. , ). Because the patient had bradycardia, diffuse spasm, and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia during ischemic episodes, dual implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was implanted. Then, 50 mg isosorbid 5-mononitrate and 90 mg diltiazem 2×1 po treatment was initiated. Episodes of syncope continued, and ventricular fibrillation reoccurred during an ischemic episode because of vasospasm. During follow-up, the diltiazem dose was increased up to 480 mg, and episodes were taken under control. In the sixth-month follow-up, the patient had no complaints of angina and syncope and his vasospastic episodes were under control with treatment.","Inclusion Criteria: An out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia as first registered cardiac rhythm, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)-score less than or equal to 8.

"A 72 year-old man developed right side weakness after a left ACA infarction and was transferred to the department of rehabilitation medicine 7 weeks after the attack. He had no remarkable medical history but was diagnosed with diabetes at our hospital. He had a family history of ischemic stroke (affecting his younger brother). On transfer to our department, he was alert but had cognitive impairment with a K-MMSE (Korean version of the Mini-Mental Status Examination) score of 13. Manual muscle test (MMT) grades of his right upper extremity-were all 3/5, lower extremity test grades were 2/5 except for ankle plantar flexor grades of 1/5, and dorsiflexor grades were 0/5. He had no spasticity in his elbow and knee joints, and had a modified Ashworth scale (MAS) score of zero. His sensory function was intact and deep tendon reflex was normoactive. He complained that his hand moved abnormally against his will. He could grasp and release with his bare hands on the doctor's order, but when grasping some objects with his palm, he was unable to release them. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed acute cerebral infarction at the left ACA region (). For TMS, we used a Magstim 200 monopulse® (Magstim co., Whiteland, UK) connected to a figure-eight coil (7 cm outer diameter for each loop) with a maximum magnetic strength of 2.0 tesla. The coil was initially centered on the vertex, perpendicular to the scalp, with the handle pointing posteriorly at a 45 degree angle from the median sagittal line and then moved in 1 cm steps in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle with a surface gel electrode. The active electrode was placed over the muscle belly and the reference electrode over the distal interphalangeal joint of the index finger. The signals were displayed by Keypoint® EMG (Dantec, Skovlunde, Denmark) and stored in a laboratory computer. Using a paired pulse magnetic stimulation technique, we studied intracortical inhibition (ICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF). In this case, when we stimulated the left motor cortex area, the resting motor threshold (rMT) was 54% of the maximum magnetic strength and the MEP amplitude was 287 µV. At the right motor cortex area, the rMT was 57% and the MEP amplitude was 579 µV. In the ICF study, when we stimulated the left motor cortex area, the MEP amplitude was increased to 1,697 µV.

"A 21-year-old male with a history of one episode of right orchitis well treated with antibiotics two years ago presented to the urology outpatient department with a painless swelling of the right hemiscrotum without any associated other symptoms. Local examination revealed a palpable firm right testicular mass with atrophy of the whole testis. The left testis was palpated in the scrotum and is of normal size with no suspicious mass. His laboratory findings including Germ Cell Tumour serum markers were within the normal range (Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP): 0,86 μg/L, Beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-HCG) < 0,5 mIU/mL, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 241 UI/ml).
Scrotal ultrasound () demonstrated a suspicious solid well-defined mass within the right epididymis, measuring 21 x 14 mm. The mass was slightly heterogeneous with hyperechoic appearance and regular smooth contour. Distinct from the lesion, the right testis appeared smaller in size measuring 23 x 12 x 15 mm. Imaging of the contralateral scrotum revealed no anomaly. A radical right orchiectomy was performed via an inguinal incision. Recovery was uneventful. The surgical specimen consisted of the right testis measuring 3.5x2.5x1 cm in size and of the spermatic cord measuring 5 cm in length. Sectioning of the specimen () revealed a single well circumscribed nodular tissue with multiple foci of hemorrhage. Microscopic examination of the nodular tissue () showed an admixture of mature lobulated adipose tissue and numerous dilated and thicken walled blood vessels with no signs of malignancies such as germ cell atypia or intraepithelial germ cell neoplasm. Thus a diagnosis of paratesticular angiolipoma was made.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 64-year-old COVID-19 patient was presented with respiratory distress to our intensive care unit. High-resolution computed tomography revealed severe involvement of both the lungs. Supplemental oxygen was given at 15 L/min. The peripheral saturation of oxygen was 90% and arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed a pH 7.33, PCO2 30.40, PO2 73.8, Na 130, K 4.21, and HCO3 17.9. Non-invasive ventilation (CPAP) was ensued with Fio2 70%, pressure support 14, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 7 (cm H2O). Despite increasing the FiO2 to 100%, the clinical status of the patient deteriorated the next day. He became tachypneic (respiratory rate (RR) > 35) with peripheral oxygen saturation of less than 90%. Extra oxygen through a nasal cannula at 10 L/min () was added. This was done to decrease the rebreathing of expired air inside the NIV mask and in the anatomical dead space of the nasopharynx. Soon, we found improvement in oxygen saturation (SpO2 > 95%) with ABG showing PO2 85 mm Hg and PCO2 37.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 49 years-old woman with ten-year recurrent non-bloody watery diarrhea and abdominal pain came to our observation in 2015. No family history of gastrointestinal disorders was detected. A full ileocolonscopy performed 5 years before (no biopsies collected) was normal, leading to a diagnosis of an irritable bowel syndrome, so managed with symptomatic drugs without significant clinical benefit. She had also an history of repeated endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) because of polyps’ recurrence, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease and severe eosinophilic asthma with frequent exacerbations, requiring short courses of oral corticosteroids. Over the years, it appeared that oral steroids induced also a complete relief of gastrointestinal symptoms, with a relapse at withdrawal. Therefore, the patient had repeated steroids exposure, developing dependence and several side-effects.
At admission to our department, she complained watery diarrhea (5–6 bowel movements/day) preceded by abdominal pain. Her vital signs were: SpO2 95% (room air), Temperature 35.8 °C, Heart Rate 100 bpm, Respiratory Rate 18/m, Blood Pressure 108/60 mmHg.
Physical examination was significant only for mild tenderness in the mesogastric area with intact bowel sounds. No organomegaly was found. Visual analog scale (VAS) score for abdominal pain was moderate/severe (60). Besides elevated peripheral blood eosinophil (0.38 × 109/L) laboratory tests were unremarkable. Stool examinations were negative for parasitic, bacteria and clostridium difficile infections. Pulmonary functional tests revealed a Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV1) of 63% (of predicted value), Asthma Control Test (ACT) score was 13, Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) was 93, Lund–Mackay (LM) score was 20. Baseline mean OCS dose was 15 mg of prednisone per day. Four OCS requiring asthmatic exacerbations occurred during the previous year.
An ileocolonscopy revealed a normal aspect of the mucosa of each explored segment, except for a small polyp (2 mm) in the rectum, that was removed. Biopsies collected from apparently normal mucosa showed instead an important linfoplasmacellular and granulocytic infiltrate in the lamina propria with a predominance of eosinophils (Fig. a, b).
Moreover, no significant findings emerged from gastroscopy, but biopsy specimens, collected in antrum, showed as well as the linfomonocytic and eosinophil granulocytic infiltrate disrupting the glandular structures (Fig. c).
According to the immunopathogenetic mechanisms of the diseases and in order to spare oral steroids, in 2017, we started treatment with subcutaneous MEP at the standard dose of 100 mg every 4 weeks, using the severe eosinophilic asthma schedule.
As expected, blood eosinophil count was reduced after the first administration, and became lower and lower during the next 48 weeks (30 cells/mm3). After 3 months, patient experienced a significant improvement of sinusitic, respiratory as well as gastrointestinal symptoms. FEV1 and SNOT-22 were evaluated at 6 and 12 month, showing a global improvement (75% and 95%; 51 and 21 respectively). ACT raised to 23. LM score reduced to 8 at month 12. VAS score for abdominal pain reduced to 20 after 3 months so gradually all oral corticosteroids were successfully reduced by patient. After 6 months, patient was in steroid-free clinical remission with a stool frequency of 1–2 movements/day of normal feces (type 3 according to the Bristol stool chart) and a complete resolution of abdominal pain. BMI (Body Mass Index) reduced from 28 to 23 and none asthma exacerbation occurred during the first year of treatment and until the last follow-up evaluation (24 months) [].
Endoscopies were repeated in order to obtain new biopsy specimens, showing a remission of the disease in term of eosinophilic inflammation, glands where normal and neither reactive hyperchromatic changes, nor mucin depletion can be appreciated (Fig. d–f).
Basophils activation was evaluated after 12 months of MEP, using the surface molecules CD203c, CD63 and CD125, showing a reduction of activation percentages. Results are shown in Fig. a, b []. Serum IL-5 levels (R&D Systems; sensitivity: 0.29 pg/ml) were measured at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment and are shown in Fig. . Serum IL-5 was non-quantifiable at baseline and showed an increase with peak on 6 months as expected and previously demonstrated by Pouliquen et al. in 2015 (Fig. c) [].","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year.

"A previously healthy 52-year-old female was diagnosed with a partially obstructing rectal cancer 8 cm from the anal verge. The patient underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by a robotic ultra-low anterior resection with a stapled anastomosis and proximal diversion. At 2-month post-operatively, a rectovaginal fistula was noted. The patient underwent a perineal repair of the fistula with gracilis muscle interposition flap. The loop ileostomy was reversed after endoscopic and radiological evidence of fistula healing. The fistula recurred 1 month later necessitating another ileostomy. Four weeks later, the fistula was repaired trans-abdominally as described below.
A 5 cm Pfannenstiel incision was made and extended down to the anterior rectus sheath which was divided transversely. Flaps were created superiorly and inferiorly separating the rectus muscle from the anterior fascia followed by division of the peritoneum in the midline to enter the abdomen. Three 5-mm trocars were placed at the umbilicus, the right and left lower quadrants. After laparoscopic resection of the previous anastomosis and take down/repair of the fistula, a redo ultra-low anterior resection was performed with a transanal inter-sphincteric resection, coloanal pull-through and a hand-sewn anastomosis.
The left rectus muscle was then harvested in a laparoscopic-assisted fashion through the Pfannenstiel incision without longitudinal division of either anterior or posterior rectus sheaths []. The rectus muscle was divided superiorly at the level of the costal margin and inferiorly at the pubis while preserving the deep inferior epigastric vessels. The flap was then rotated and transposed between the rectum and the vagina and held by interrupted sutures. The transverse anterior rectus sheath incision was closed primarily. The total operative time was 4 h while the rectus harvest time was less than 45 min. The patient's post-operative course was uneventful with minimal pain, and the patient was discharged home after 6 days. The patient continued to do well at 4-month follow-up without any evidence of fistula recurrence or hernia formation.","Inclusion Criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18 years, Sustained ROSC within 60 minutes of arrest, Patient is comatose (unresponsive and unable to follow verbal commands) after resuscitation.

"A 23-year-old male with a history of migraine headaches for over 10 years was studied. The headaches responded favorably to usual analgesic treatment and worsened with physical exercise.
The patient looked for medical attention due to sudden and intense headaches in the occipital region with no evident cause, whose characteristics differed from the previous ones. An emergency computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, revealing the presence of a right occipital intracerebral hematoma that required immediate hospitalization and treatment for a month until resolution of the clot. One year after being symptom-free, he began to experience a mild to moderate oppressive headache in the right temporal region, which improved with analgesics for approximately 15 days. After that, the oppressive headache restarted with more intense hemicrania, accompanied by fatigue, short episodes of altered consciousness, sweating, multiple instances of projectile vomiting, and blurred vision of the left eye. General physical and neurological exams did not show any positive data, nor was there evidence of triggering events, such as traumatic brain injury, hematologic disorders, previous surgeries, or infections of the central nervous system (CNS).
Mood changes, including permanent irritability, aggressiveness, anxiety, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and temporo-spatial time disorientation, appeared during the follow-up period and a second CT-scan was performed.
Laboratory tests included the following: hemoglobin 133 g/L; leucocytes 8.1 × 103, platelets 373 u/L. A coagulogram indicated the following: suitable platelets, bleeding time 1.30 s, coagulation time 8 min, prothrombin time 15.2 s (control 13 s ± 3), and activated thromboplastin time 30 s; glycemia 4.83 mmol/L; glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) 42.51 U/L; glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GPT) 42.29 U/L; cholesterol 4.24 mmol/L; triglycerides 0.90 mmol/L; creatinin 82.81 μmol/L; uric acid 280 μmol/L; total protein 72.15 g/L; albumin 41.30 g/L; negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and non-reactive Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL).
Urgent multislice tomography showed a laminar SDH in the right fronto-parietal region, a posterior interhemispheric fissure at the level of the tentorium, and ipsilateral occipital intracerebral hematoma (2.2 × 2.3 cm in axial section), with a volume of 7 mL. These lesions produced a slight mass effect on the neighboring structures, and the midline was displaced 0.5 cm ().
Both hematomas were reabsorbed gradually (), with satisfactory clinical evolution after a two-month follow-up period. shows the increased frontal subdural hematoma and its extension to parietal and frontal lobes. Angiography revealed ecstatic cortical veins, one of them with saccular dilatation adjacent to the IPH (). For this reason, we decided to perform cerebral angiography, which confirmed the dural arteriovenous fistula. It connected the artery, a branch of the external carotid artery, with cortical veins in the superior sagittal sinus drainage ().

"A 55-year-old woman reported a 24-hour history of unusual pain in her left carotid area irradiating to the ear. Colour Doppler ultrasound revealed an eccentric hypoechoic thickening (black arrows on Figure ) of the proximal bulbar internal carotid but also partially of the carotid bifurcation itself. A thin hyperechoic atheromatous fibrous plaque was also visible (small white arrows on Figure ) but no significant stenosis was found. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound showed normal capillary distribution of micro bubbles in the hypo echoic thickening, therefore excluding haematoma (Figure , black arrows). The avascular fibrous plaque was well demonstrated (small black arrows). Unenhanced Axial T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging showed an hypo intense tissue (Figure , black arrows) around the proximal internal carotid. Intense enhancement of this tissue was shown on fat-saturated contrast enhanced T1-weighted images (Figure ).

He experienced pain with deep palpation in the epigastrium and no organomegaly or lymphadenopathy was identified. The left scrotal sac was enlarged and indurated and there was a mass in the left scrotum that was indistinguishable from the left testis and provoked displacement of structures of the penis and right testis (the right scrotum was empty). No inguinal lymphadenopathy was identified.
Laboratory tests revealed normal liver function. Hemoglobin was 9.13 g/dl, MCV was 87.9 fL, WBC was 11.9 K/uL, neutrophils were 9.81 K/uL, lymphocyte count was 1.59 K/uL, and platelet level was 252 K/uL.

After resuscitation with crystalloid solutions, he underwent upper endoscopy. The gastroenterologist found abundant active bleeding, for which orotracheal intubation was decided to provide airway protection. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. A second upper endoscopy revealed a type 1 isolated gastric varix, treated with cyanoacrylate without complications ().
A scrotal US showed a large heterogeneous image in the left testicle area, with an echogenic and cystic solid component and flow presence with color Doppler assessment.
A contrasted CT scan of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis showed a liver of normal size and density with multiple retrocrural, retroperitoneal, mesenteric, and left iliac metastatic lymphadenopathy which caused extrinsic compression of the portal vein along with splenic vein partial thrombosis with left-sided portal hypertension and perigastric and perisplenic collateral neovascularization (). A heterogeneous, well defined mass was found in the left testicle, 16.7 × 16.1 × 14.9 cm, with a solid component that was enhanced with the administration of contrast, as well as a cystic component. There was also invasion of the left spermatic cord.
The patient was extubated after surveillance and transferred to the Internal Medicine Department. We started chemotherapy with etoposide 100 mg/m2 and cisplatin 20 mg/m2, and seven days later the patient underwent a left radical orchiectomy by an inguinal approach with left hemiscrotectomy, without complications. Following this intervention, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was reduced to 350 ng/mL, and the human chorionic gonadotropin level was 50 IU/mL.

"A 36-year-old African American male diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome positive CML two years ago presented to the emergency room for the second time with a history of a one-month progressively worsening weakness involving his left upper extremity, along with numbness and severe pain. His symptoms during the previous hospital evaluation were attributed to musculoskeletal causes after stroke was ruled out. Although he was unsure, he was reported by family members to have developed some facial asymmetry during this time. He had been noncompliant with his treatment with dasatinib, being irregular and casual in his approach to prescribed medication intake, and his primary oncologist was concerned with CML progression at an accelerated phase after having undergone a bone marrow biopsy. He was meanwhile awaiting the results of a recent cervical lymph node biopsy.
On neurological examination the patient was noticed to have left-sided ptosis, miosis, enophthalmos (), and reported facial anhidrosis on the left side, alongside ipsilateral weakness predominantly involving his intrinsic hand muscles, long finger flexors, and numbness involving the medial border of his arm, hand, and little finger (see Video 1 in Supplementary Material available online at ). The rest of his motor power was 5/5 throughout, with restriction of an accurate evaluation of his left upper extremity, due to exquisite pain-limited range-of-motion of the whole limb. Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ throughout. Plantar reflexes were down going bilaterally and no sensory level was appreciated. His findings were concerning for left Horner's syndrome and lower trunk brachial plexopathy, while the rest of his general physical examination was significant for scattered, nontender cervical lymphadenopathy.
His blood count revealed marked leukocytosis with a total leukocyte count of 102 × 109/L, predominated by myeloid precursors, 4% promyelocytes, 3% myelocytes, and 12% metamyelocytes. An electrodiagnostic study was deferred due to lack of patient cooperation from the pain. An MRI of the cervical spine and brachial plexus with and without contrast was performed. This revealed the presence of a bulky left paraspinal soft tissue mass (), extending from the C6 to T3 level, measuring 3.9 × 6.8 × 7.8 cm, anteroposterior, transverse, and cephalocaudad dimensions, respectively. This also involved the left C6 to T1 nerve roots and extended into the supraclavicular and retroclavicular segment of the left brachial plexus over approximately 6.8 cm in length, most consistent with leukemic infiltration. Extension into the spinal canal on the left was noted from C6/7 to the bottom of the T1 level without cord compression, along with abnormal bone marrow signal intensity involving the posteromedial first rib and left anterior scalene muscle, all again consistent with leukemic infiltration. Extensive lymphadenopathy was noted on imaging studies (), particularly involving the submandibular, left, and right internal jugular lymph nodes. The excisional biopsy of right cervical lymph node, meanwhile, confirmed myeloid sarcoma or chloroma with immunophenotyping revealing 32% blasts displaying myeloid-associated antigen expression and aberrant expression of CD5, CD7, and CD 117 (). In view of the collateral histological findings, his neurological presentation was attributed to a paraspinal chloroma with regional leukemic infiltration of the left lower brachial plexus, and a final diagnosis of CML with extramedullary myeloid blast crisis was made. He was started on aggressive induction chemotherapy with a 7 + 3 regimen (7 days of cytarabine at 100 mg/m2 plus 3 days of idarubicin at 12 mg/m2) in addition to resuming dasatinib. He was also initiated on radiotherapy of 10 fractionations to a total of 3000 centigray (cGy) for the paraspinal chloroma. Bone marrow biopsy on Day 14 was hypocellular with no blasts identified or evidence of residual leukemia. Repeat Computed Tomography of soft tissue neck showed interval decrease in size of his cervical lymphadenopathies and paraspinal soft tissue mass. His postchemotherapy, inhospital course was complicated with neutropenic fever, clostridium difficile diarrhea, and multifocal pneumonia with pleural effusion from which he gradually recovered. At the time of hospital discharge, his neurological deficits continued to persist. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and prophylactic intrathecal liposomal cytarabine (given his high risk for CNS involvement) were discussed as part of the postremission treatment plan.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Patients 18 years of age or older, Patients admitted under medical or surgical services, Patients treated with diet alone, insulin (SQ, insulin pump) or oral hypoglycemic medications, Have their own Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) monitor present on admission or able to be placed after admission.

"A 48 year old male patient was referred to a private endodontic practice for evaluation and treatment of a maxillary left lateral incisor. He complained of pain on biting and palpation in the area. Medical history was non-contributory. In his dental history, he reported that the tooth had been treated non-surgically 12 months earlier. Clinical examination revealed moderate percussion sensitivity. Periodontal probing and mobility were within normal limits when compared to contralateral and adjacent teeth. The radiographic examination revealed periapical radiolucency 7 - 8 mm in diameter along the distal surface of the root, indicative of either an accessory canal or a possible apical fracture (). The radiograph also showed a titanium screw that was used for fixation of the membrane during a previous implant placement procedure performed two years before presentation. The tooth had porcelain fused to a metal crown with good margins and esthetics. On the basis of the history and clinical and radiographic examination, a diagnosis of a previous root canal treatment with symptomatic apical periodontitis was established. The patient was offered all treatment options; he opted for microsurgical retreatment. Written consent was obtained.
The micro-surgical technique, as suggested by Kim and Kratchman, was performed in addition to creation of a bony window osteotomy. After rinsing with 0.12% chlorhexidine solution (Peridex, Zila Pharmaceuticals Inc., Phoenix, AZ, USA) for 60 seconds, the patient was administered 2 carpules of 4% articaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine (3M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany) buccal and palatal infiltration. After ensuring profound anesthesia, a full thickness sulcular flap was elevated, with one release incision distal to the left canine. The exposed site was considered a candidate for the bony window osteotomy as the cortical plate was found to be intact. The osteotomy was performed using a piezoelectric device (Piezotome 2, Acteon Satelec, Acteon Germany GmbH, Mettmann, Germany). The BS5 Tip (Acteon Satelec, Acteon Germany GmbH) was used to make an outline on the exposed cortical plate based on the measurement made on the digital radiograph and the topography of the exposed bone. Two vertical and two horizontal grooves were joined to create a bony window of approximately 6 mm by 12 mm, at the recommended setting mode of 3 with 60 mL/minute irrigation of sterile saline (). The average width of the cut was approximately 1 mm. The carved bony window was lifted off with a curved osteotome (). The bone block was stored in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) in order to keep it hydrated. The granulation tissue at the surgically exposed site was removed by curettage with bone and curved periodontal curettes until healthy bone margins were encountered and the root tip was clearly visible. A biopsy sample was sent for histologic evaluation. The denuded root was stained with methylene blue and inspected under high magnification (×16) with a surgical operating microscope (Carl Zeiss OPMI Pico, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) for a vertical root fracture or perforation. Upon curettage, the root presented with a fracture line extending from the root tip to about 4 mm along the length on the distal surface. The fractured portion of the root was eliminated during apical resection with a high-speed carbide Lindemann surgical bur (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA) at a zero degree bevel. The resected root surface was then stained again for inspection under high magnification (×16). The root-end preparation was achieved using ultrasonic surgical JetTips (B&L Biotech USA Inc., Fairfax, VA, USA), and the root-end cavity was filled with white mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA, ProRoot MTA, Dentsply Tulsa Dental, Tulsa, OK, USA) (). The bony window was repositioned (). Care was taken not to depress it into the osteotomy site but instead place it in alignment with the remaining bone in its original alignment. As the insert used with the piezoelectric to create the bone window was very thin, the bone flap was re-approximated firmly. 6-0 propylene nylon sutures (Supramid, S. Jackson Inc., Alexandria, VA, USA) were used for suturing the soft tissue. A postoperative radiograph was taken (). The patient was prescribed an oral analgesic (ibuprofen 600 mg) and instructed to rinse twice daily with a 0.2% chlorhexidine mouth rinse for 1 week. The sutures were removed 7 days after surgery.
The patient presented for follow-up at 9 () and 18 () months with radiographic signs of complete healing and no clinical signs or symptoms.","Inclusion Criteria: Patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 1 or 2, Age 65 years or older, To be under follow-up in the same center for at least one year. Exclusion Criteria: Younger than 65 years old, having decompensated liver disease, psychiatric disorders interfering cognition or compliance, having bariatric surgery or on renal replacement therapy.",0.5
